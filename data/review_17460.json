There's a lot of changes to the game, with the most notable one being a serious graphical overhaul, but the most important change IMO is that [b]the Mako is no longer completely awful to use[/b]. \n\nThe Mako is everyone's least favourite part of ME1: there's a reason there's no Mako in ME2/ME3. It wouldn't really be possible to remove it from the game without a serious overhaul, but they made it pack a serious punch in the LE remaster (the cannon will one-shot basic enemies even on insanity) and give full kill XP. \n\nIt's not a bad game, but it's been made fully obsolete by the remaster.", "timestamp_created": 1695043237, "timestamp_updated": 1695043237, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52534562349319458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146316928": {"recommendationid": "146316928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971186061", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 4332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4332, "last_played": 1332140400}, "language": "spanish", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1694754023, "timestamp_updated": 1694754023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146310297": {"recommendationid": "146310297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202806553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35894, "last_played": 1696522060}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic fun", "timestamp_created": 1694741210, "timestamp_updated": 1694741210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146140659": {"recommendationid": "146140659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126439224", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 760, "last_played": 1694472206}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest games every created", "timestamp_created": 1694472288, "timestamp_updated": 1694472288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145842018": {"recommendationid": "145842018", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971563955", "num_games_owned": 599, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1783, "last_played": 1485287775}, "language": "english", "review": "ME1 aged very poorly, even the Legendary Edition.

As Kiba Snowpaw, a lonely Ice Wolf hailing from an icy planet, who's spent over three and a half decades immersing in games, anime, and manga, my expectations are as high as the snow-capped peaks outside my window. The life of a solitary furry may be bracing, but the warmth of my passion for gaming, bolstered by the countless projects I've funded on Kickstarter and Patreon, sustains me. You see, my contribution has not only been monetary, but also emotional. This isn't just a hobby; it's a lifeline, a haven from the biting winds of my reality, a sanctuary for a troubled mind haunted by depression and the labor of caring for an ailing father.\n\nSo, let me dive headlong into the icy depths of the game that stands before me: Mass Effect (2007). \ud83d\ude80\n\nRemember, folks, I'm an old-school gamer, and I'll tell you this much: #OldIsGold. The graphics? Groundbreaking, especially for the time. The voice acting? Sublime. It's like slipping into a well-worn glove, the game inviting me into an expansive universe, every character meticulously crafted, and every dialogue perfectly scripted. The comparisons with Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic are inevitable, but this game delivers an experience far beyond the realm of simple space opera. This, my friends, is an epic!\n\nThe dilemma of choosing whether to embrace the light or to descend into the dark depths of malevolence, the tenuous balance between good and evil, is a delicate dance that Mass Effect choreographs masterfully.\ud83e\ude84 Add to this the robust lore and narrative, the immersive world-building, and the dynamic gameplay, and you're in for one heck of a gaming experience.\n\nHowever, it's not all intergalactic roses. The black pixelated character bug at Peak 15? A disruption, a glitch in the matrix that fractures the otherwise seamless narrative. But hey, every gem has its flaws, and this one can be easily remedied. And let's not forget the dated combat mechanics and the monotonous exploration. The clunky Mako, with its infuriatingly frustrating controls, may drive you to distraction, but the storyline swiftly pulls you back in. The tedious elevators? Simply a necessary evil, I suppose. \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe expansive landscapes, though occasionally marred by repetitive designs, still manage to evoke awe and wonder. As for the squad-based combat, it leaves something to be desired, but as any seasoned gamer knows, the AI isn't always your best buddy on the battlefield.\n\nYet, amidst these flaws, there's a charm that keeps you coming back. This game isn't just about blasting aliens and saving the universe. No, it's about forging relationships, making choices that resonate throughout the trilogy, and experiencing a narrative that rivals the most acclaimed sci-fi sagas. It's about the thrill of the hunt, the heartbreak of loss, and the triumph of victory. The game makes you laugh, cry, rage, and rejoice, often all within the same mission.\n\nSo, despite the bumps and hiccups, I can safely say that Mass Effect (2007) is worth every penny of the asking price. Trust me, don't let the naysayers deter you from this incredible journey. And remember, #ItsNotAboutTheDestinationItsTheJourney. The game is more than the sum of its parts. It's an odyssey, an epic, a lifestyle.\n\nSo grab that controller, select your class, and jump aboard the Normandy. The galaxy is waiting. The choices are yours. The adventure is just beginning. \ud83c\udf0c\n\nFinal verdict: The game may have aged, but like a good wine, it's gotten better with time. A must-play for any RPG fan. Just remember: We are all Commander Shepard in this journey, and we all have our own stories to tell. \ud83c\udfae\n\nSo, as I conclude, the lonely Arctic wind howls outside my window, mirroring the desolate landscapes I've traversed in-game. But within me, there's a fire. A passion kindled by Mass Effect. It's the same fire that's seen me through countless trials and tribulations, through toxic relationships and mind-numbing depression. It's the fire that fuels the life of Kiba Snowpaw. As I sit back in my chair, staring at the end credits, I know I'll be back. After all, the universe isn't going to save itself.\n\nNow, time for some hot cocoa and a warm blanket. I think Garrus Vakarian would approve. \ud83d\udc3a\u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1689530354, "timestamp_updated": 1689530354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482581406831741333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142192920": {"recommendationid": "142192920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043388988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 2343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2343, "last_played": 1672341989}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great Science Fiction cinematic experience with an impressive story and lore.", "timestamp_created": 1689506379, "timestamp_updated": 1689506379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142191292": {"recommendationid": "142191292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152240558", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2616, "last_played": 1689969053}, "language": "spanish", "review": "The best space opera together with Knights of the Old Republic", "timestamp_created": 1689504233, "timestamp_updated": 1689504233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142155049": {"recommendationid": "142155049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051818594", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21574, "last_played": 1691175633}, "language": "english", "review": "fun and cool\n", "timestamp_created": 1689453211, "timestamp_updated": 1689453211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498251765966415405", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142068251": {"recommendationid": "142068251", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060859571", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1689349911}, "language": "english", "review": "I genuinely appreciate this game and believe it to be a fantastic experience.

Developed by BioWare, this science fiction epic takes players on an unforgettable journey across the galaxy, where choices have consequences and the fate of civilizations rests in your hands. It's no wonder that Mass Effect became an instant classic upon its release and continues to captivate players to this day.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped into the shoes of Commander Shepard, I was enthralled by the game's rich universe, engaging characters, and immersive gameplay. The level of depth and attention to detail is staggering, with each planet, species, and conversation meticulously crafted to create a living, breathing sci-fi world.\n\nThe storyline is nothing short of remarkable. As Shepard, players are tasked with saving the galaxy from an ancient alien threat known as the Reapers. The writing is top-notch, blending political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and personal relationships into a compelling narrative that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The choices you make throughout the game not only impact the immediate outcome but also carry over to future installments, ensuring a truly personalized experience.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are equally outstanding. Mass Effect seamlessly combines third-person shooter action with RPG elements, offering a perfect balance between intense combat sequences and character development. The ability to customize Shepard's skills, appearance, and personality adds an extra layer of immersion, making you feel like a true space-faring hero.\n\nOne aspect that sets Mass Effect apart from other games is its memorable cast of characters. Each companion is brilliantly written, fleshed out with their own backstory, motivations, and unique personalities. Interacting with them not only deepens the story but also forges deep connections and friendships that resonate long after the game is over.\n\nVisually, Mass Effect was ahead of its time. The art direction and graphical fidelity still hold up remarkably well, transporting players to stunning alien worlds and space stations that brim with life. Coupled with an atmospheric soundtrack that perfectly complements the on-screen action, the game creates an immersive audiovisual experience that is second to none.\n\nFurthermore, the attention to detail in the game's world-building is unparalleled. The Codex provides a vast amount of lore and information about the universe, allowing players to delve deeper into the game's universe if they desire.\n\nIn conclusion, Mass Effect 2007 is a gaming masterpiece that deserves all the acclaim it has received over the years.

This is a top quality title with incredible art, writing, voice acting, controls, and animations. Few games of today can match the smoothness of this one. \n\nLikes:\n1. The expansive universe and the ability to roam freely for most of the game.\n2. Smoothness in transition between areas/maps.\n3. Overall quality of the writing, story, and voice acting.\n4. Combat dynamics and controls.\n5. The addition of a usable vehicle to explore various planet surfaces. \n6. Character depth and different alien race backstories.\n7. In-depth dialogues that added a lot of richness to the story, and the overall dialogue functions.\n8. The overall universe that was created within the game that leaves room for much more story and exploration.\n\nDislikes:\n1. There were two levels that, for some reason, never properly loaded the moving bit maps, so they showed up as black blobs. Probably had something to do with the age of the game and software incompatibilities with modern hardware/software.\n2. The galaxy view map is a bit overwhelming. I wish it had some sort of tracking to let you know where you had already been and if there was anything left to survey or explore. I visited some planets multiple times by mistake not realizing I had already been there and done everything. Some systems were hidden to me until I realized I can \"move around\" the nebulae to find systems that were not visible from the default view.\n3. Some key points on interest not showing up on the maps (intentionally). I understand the mineral points not showing up, but still is a strange story continuity issue... if you can \"survey\" a planet that you can't land on from orbit to find stuff like mineral deposits, why can't you do it for the planets where you can make a landing?\n4. The game's money system. At first, everything is prohibitively expensive, then evens out, then everything seems super cheap towards the back 1/2 of the game. I ended the game maxed out at $9,999,999 credits and nothing to spend it on. It would have been nice to have more unique items in the various stores. \n5. No control over the ability points spent on your crew. I really wanted the decryption and electronics skills to advance on my team members before other skills, but I had no choice, so had to wait until I got to a certain level overall to be able to open the most hardened containers/computers. That made for a lot of disappointing backtracking near the end of the game. \n6. The all too predictable and poorly written love story addition to the plot line. Would have liked to see better writing around that topic, or just avoid it entirely.\n7. Not a whole lot to entice playing through more than once. There are some decisions you could re-do and alternate story lines at key points, but not to the point where I feel it is worth replaying the entire game, but perhaps others do. \n\nOverall - If you really liked the original Deus Ex, then you will really enjoy this game. Very similar in overall concept (RPG+Shooter) and quality. This one had more features/finesse added on the top. Plus the ability to drive a vehicle with a functional tank-like cannon! Boom!!

Lost interest.  Tried again this year, and quit about the same point.  I now see why.\n\nTo put it shortly, the game is desperately overrated.  Once you get past the slick initial production values and any nerd-excitement over a game that tries to be a modern take on Star Trek/Star Wars/Babylon 5 -- once you are over the gleaming, well-made ad copy and cover -- what you are left with is a bland, uninspired, repetitive, janky kind-of-sort-of FPS adventure shooter made by a company whose forte is not FPSes, with many poor and frustrating design decisions.  And on top of all that, you start to notice the jank and lack of polish in actual gameplay more and more as you get further in.\n\nTo begin with, so much can be forgiven for a game with a great story.  I mean, I used to play Sierra point-and-click adventures, and where is the gameplay in them.  Unfortunately, that's likely the greatest failure of ME.  You can see the development team definitely put some effort into worldbuilding, trying to create a gritty game universe in the vein of the aforementioned movies/series.  But, like so much these days, the voice actors do what they can, but the writing is flat, the characters deep only in a ham-handed sense, and the story watery and paper-thin, but done in a sullen and emphatic way.  I mean, if you're going to be superficial and trite, at least say it like you mean it and add little twitches, right?\n\nThe dialogue honestly feels like an extended military recruitment ad for people of a more liberal mindset, ranging from bland cliche to outright implausible and unintentionally funny.  Or just cringy -- quite a bit to cringe at in there.\n\nBut the gameplay, right?  A BioWare adventure that's an FPS shooter, how fun!  It is, at first.  Then you see the battles (and their set locations) are repetitive, flat/boring, and often silly (did you know that you are the only person in the universe with a vehicle, and you can just mow down enemies galore while they stand relatively still like target practice, firing weapons that travel slow enough to be easily dodged, and when they do hit, they tick away your vehicle's shields/armor ever so gently, even at the highest difficulty levels?).  Once you've visited 10 planets/fighting locations, you have now seen all the set locations and maps that you are going to see, over and over again, for the rest of the game, with a few slight twists here and there.\n\nIt tries to come off as a tactical game -- you can give orders to your 2 companions and tell them to go here, take cover there, but you quickly realize that this is not only unnecessary, but poorly-implemented and they don't really listen to you very well anyway.  The enemy AI is dumb, and so is your companions' AI.  Tactics are silly here anyway, just shoot enemies like a 90s FPS and you'll do fine.\n\nLoot is visually-undifferentiated versions of the same guns (okay, maybe slight color differences, but same model and only a few skins), listed textually.  At some point, you stop caring, and I was forced to deal with it when the game said I was approaching the limit of 250 items to process.  And once you've seen a few, you've seen them all.  And then you *do* have to *process* them.  It's tedious as hell and, well, dumb.  Streamlined ad absurdum.\n\nStrangely, one of the design choices that aggravated me most was the slow movement.  You walk/jog along pretty slowly, but can sprint languidly for up to 5 seconds, after which you have to wait 20 seconds for stamina to recharge.  And there's a lot of empty walking and backtracking -- imagine any BioWare adventure where the characters all walk really slowly.\n\nAnd then the vehicular planetary exploration seems fun -- I was excited when I first saw it, thinking, wow, like Starflight of old!  But, spoiler, it ends up being a slow, tedious slog to find locations on the planet, especially if you'd like to be completionist and find it all, with some of them behind very difficult-to-negotiate cliffs and mountain crags that will have you crawling out of your skin saying, okay, I'm done, let me just move past this stupid thing; why is there no flying vehicle anyway?  How does this heavy supertank, which must be super-valuable since it's the only wheeled combat vehicle in the universe, get back up in to the ship anyway?\n\nAnd the sci-fi aspect -- I mean, a field of so much potential -- ends up being undermined by the fact that everywhere you go, every planet you find, every icon on the mini-map you explore, you find...  more stuff like a certain religious leader's writings, or an insignia from a colony.  It's narcissistic sci-fi where mankind looks out at the universe and sees only himself.  Like if I finally made it to Proxima Centauri, visited an exotic world, and found a Devo CD and a Bible.  Boring and uninspired.  Whip it good, though, I guess.\n\nBut, again, back to the fact that, in the end, this is a story game, first and foremost, and that's where it must be judged most strictly.  The story is in line with 2010s superhero movie stories.  Take an implausible comic-book-villain in a story written by people who don't understand human interactions and behavior very well, but make it gritty and have a mature intelligent *feel* to it (like ham-handed allusion to real-world social issues, but nothing you wouldn't get in a 90s cop movie).  Myself, I'd rather have a good story told simply than a bad story told with sophistication.  It's... honestly, comparing it to 2010s superhero movies is not fair to the superhero movies.\n\nAs I mentioned, both times I have tried to play this, I got to the Virmire planet and just lost interest.  This time, the cap of it all was the ham-handed, forced Wrex drama before the mission on Virmire starts, and the way the main character and Wrex randomly, in the middle of their conversation, just suddenly have guns pointed at each other without the dialogue justifying it.  Like, they wanted to create a tense moment, but couldn't come up with the dialog to justify it.\n\nAnd that was the moment where I realized, I just can't.  THIS is what everyone rates so highly?  And this was, by the way, the updated Legendary Edition I was playing.  It is definitely one of those games where the design process and decisions were heavily dominated by corporate execs and market research, and the creatives were there just to implement the mess.\n\nThis game was way overrated when it came out, and it has aged very poorly.

You don't need Origin to run this either, which you will need for the Legendary Edition even if you buy it through Steam. You can still get the DLC for Mass Effect 1, but it's... complicated. Bring Down The Sky is worth the trouble, but not the other one.\n\nMass Effect is a very unpolished and barely put together mess of a game, but you know what? I love it the most out of the trilogy. It has the best plot and pacing of any of the games, it's the only one with a well developed villain with a satisfying final boss battle, the only game that actually lets you land on open-world planets and explore them, and is the closest RPG/shooter hybrid compared to the sequels which lean far too much into just being a Gears of War clone mechanically. Was it perfect? Hell no. The non-human party members are woefully underdeveloped in this game, the non-story relevant planets you land on are haphazardly thrown together with an abusive reuse of assets, and the combat is in this weird middle ground of being mediocre at both a shooter and an action RPG; though I will say that if you play this more like an action RPG and use you and your squad's abilities over playing it like a cover shooter, it's a lot more fun. But I can forgive all of the fumbles because the ambition to make a fully realized world based around a single sci-fi concept is undeniably here despite the lack of polish. And there are so many great things that you can do in this game which don't make it into the sequels.\n\nAt certain points in the game, you can make decisions which will affect party members' moral compass. Each party member has a hidden paragon/renegade bias which will determine who is saying the paragon and renegade arguments for Shepard's choices, and this can be affected by who you're romancing or the outcome of personal side quests or dialogue options. You can make notorious space racist (she's not actually, but I'm not gonna get into that here) Ashley an advocate for aliens or turn boy scout Kaiden into a human supremacist if you play your cards right. Side quests are much more in depth and usually have a moral choice at the end of them, which were probably supposed to play bigger roles in ME2's side quests if those weren't so horribly mangled. And say what you will about the Mako, but at least we can actually [i] explore planets in the space game [/i] instead of getting smaller hub worlds or linear levels in ME2 and fuck all in 3. And for the levels that are actually designed around the Mako, it's not actually that bad.\n\nWhat I don't like is the god awful menu system for managing equipment. Seriously, there is no excuse for it being as bad as it was here. I feel pretty confident that most people probably gave up and ignored equipment management in most playthroughs, and I don't blame them. The game also has this neo-conservative undertone in a lot of the galactic politics, being very pro-cop and pro-military, which has not aged well. Too often is the role of Spectres as unaccountable black ops agents who can do whatever they want with no consequences portrayed as necessary or even a good thing. It was probably more acceptable back in the mid 2000s, but it's not a good look now.\n\nDespite its flaws and how the series ends, I still love Mass Effect and I would still recommend playing it. Pro tip: if you are going to continue on from this game and play the entire trilogy, get the Mass Effect 3 Happy Ending Mod (aka MEHEM) when you reach that game. I normally don't recommend modding games on a first playthrough, but the base game ending is [i] so unbelievably bad [/i] that it still leaves a sour taste in my mouth over a decade later and this mod actually turns it into something satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1684466826, "timestamp_updated": 1684466826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

since i had that much in my account i said screw it and decided to take the leap and im SO glad i did i also added visual mods to make to better looking since its from like 2007 and it looks wonderful but i mostly love this so far cause it really reminds me of halo mixed with no mans sky and i LOVE that since halo is one of my alltime favorite game series and i really like no mans sky though i havent played it much cause it doesnt really feel like theres much to do but so far this game feels like theres so much to do and love that i hate when a game feels empty no only the world wise but also empty in terms of missions and things to do so long story short if you like halo and/or no mans sky i would HIGHLY reccomend giving it a try\n\nedit because i have to: just completed my first runthrough of the story and i can esaily say on of the best stories ive played in video games and i would recommend this game even more now espically since there are a lot of things you can do that

While I did have some minor trouble getting it working, it DOES work on latest Windows OS. I have mine modded with MEUITM, allowing ultra widescreen resolutions for some very nice screenshots, but I play (and record) on native 2560.\n\nDid I use 'notwithstanding' right? I hope I did. It's a nice word and I don't get to use it very often.\n\nSo for those not familiar with the game, you can choose to be either man-Shepard or fem-Shep, and chase some alien Saren around the galaxy looking to stop him bringing about the End of All Life.\n\nThere is a lot to cover so I'll try to be brief.\n\nOutdoors locations are spectacular. Visiting new worlds is a real treat, as each comes with its own skyline, planet surface, terrain, climate, and hazards (in the form of a short danger timer when you exit your rover). Sure, it isn't perfect - there are some things that need a bit of work, things like gravity and related physics, as not every planet is going to be earth-normal 0.97-1.1G (depending on where you are standing on the planet).\n\nIndoor locations ... well, they can get repetitive fast. It's like every colony or ship comes off an assembly line, with no variation in structure, apart from some minor ones. The Citadel suffers from being too big with lots of running around as well. It could have benefited from an extra fast travel station at the Normandy docking station.\n\nGameplay involves over-the-shoulder 3rd-person combat, with a variation on classes breaking down to Soldier, Tech, or Biotic, or a dualclass of two of these in one. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Every time you go somewhere you have to choose 2 people to join you, so your current team will always be 3. You can let squadmates look after their own skills in combat, or you can choose to control when they use them directly - the latter is recommended for higher difficulties, when you want to burn down a Soldier's Immunity skill, for example.\n\nCombat isn't too difficult. Even higher difficulties have their tricks. The Feros main mission, for example, has a section that has a huge pit in the middle of the area, allowing for easy kills via the use of the biotic Throw ability. One interesting tidbit is that experience earned is always more as a three-person team as opposed to rover kills.\n\nMy favourite class has to be biotic. I love the crowd control powers that come with it, and Throw is just amazing for insta-kills off edges. Lift works on the final boss, and Singularity is just great eye-candy, sending foes flying and spinning around the room... along with assorted tables, chairs and fruit bowls.\n\nIn addition, the game also makes use of a good vs evil mechanic, which is based off the decisions you make during dialogue. It requires investing skill points into to make good use of, but some points are also given for free when you reach certain paragon or renegade milestones throughout the story, meaning after 4-5 playthroughs with the same character you could potentially max these out without spending a single point. They often allow for better rewards and/or encounter outcomes.\n\nBack to the combat again. For the most part, it works pretty well. Occasionally there will be instances of you getting hit even though you are behind cover, either being hit on the edge of your body sticking out, or as projectiles go through the cover as if it wasn't there. Cover does get destroyed if it takes too many hits, unless it's outdoors, like a rock or something. But cover can be glitchy too, as sometimes you'll want to get behind cover and you won't, other times you'll want to run past it but the game forces you into it. You'll know it's glitchy if you are on Insanity and you die in a hit even if you're behind cover. Well, now you know.\n\nOne of the things I love about the original Mass Effect is the number of skills there are. ME2 really destroyed this in my opinion. I love a huge choice of things to invest in, and so much of it is useful too. Another is the characters. There is a lot of funny stuff, some of it not immediately apparent after one playthrough. Leave Liara T'soni main mission till last, for example, and her dialogue leans towards the delusional side. Play the badass instead of the goody-goody and make Conrad run away crying, wishing he'd 'never met you.' Some admiral isn't happy? 'Sounds like a normal situation.' ;)\n\nNotable voice actors include Ali Hillis, (who also voiced Lightning in the FFXIII trilogy), Seth Green (who's been in everything), Jennifer Hale (probably the most well-known female voice actor in the gaming world). These are just the ones that stand out the most for me, other actors like Keith David are also fantastic but I don't watch TV so they don't jump out at me as much.\n\nSo sure, you can buy yourself a Legendary Edition.

You exist because we allow it. And you will end because we demand it.\"[/h1]\nThe term \"must play\" is overused - but describes Mass Effect perfectly. As one of Bioware's signature series, Mass Effect sees you playing the role of Commander Shepard in a space opera/science fiction setting, as you battle to save the galaxy from the extinction of intelligent life. While you only directly control a single character (this is an action RPG after all), you have six squad mates to choose from on any given assignment, and can mix and match as you see fit (indeed, you should mix and match, as each have their own strengths and weaknesses). As is traditional of Bioware, the story is incredibly well written, the characters very well acted (both in terms of actual characterisation as well as voice lines), the art direction largely incredible (the main menu, as well as the music, are iconic) and the game universe thoroughly fleshed out with details: there is plenty to see, read and do - just the codex by itself will likely prove to be too much reading for most.\n\nWhile not an overly long game (one complete playthrough, i.e. all side quests etc. will probably take 35-40 hours), the replayability factor is very high - particularly due to the choices/avenues in the game as well as the \"classes\" present. The three major character options (Soldier, Adept and Engineer) play very differently and have different skills and abilities which affect the gameplay significantly. If you plan to use weapons mostly, Soldier might be your best bet. Biotics? You would probably want to go with Adept. You unlock further specialisations later on in the game which enhance this even further, and you can easily have three or four playthroughs with differing experiences, while not losing the entertainment factor.\n\nBefore beginning your journey into Bioware's universe, I suggest starting with the below (after installation of course; all credit to OP):\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=286766759[/url]\nThis covers generic improvements and tweaks which [b]should[/b] not be touched by the mods below.\n\nGiven how much time has passed since the original release, many mods have been created to enhance the game on today's systems. For these, you ideally want to use ME3Tweaks Mod Manager (https://me3tweaks.com/modmanager/) - it will make your life much easier. I used the below in my playthrough (many of which make a massive difference):\n[list]\n    [*]A Lot Of Textures (ALOT) 14.1 (vanilla-friendly, exhaustive and easy to install graphical overhaul mod; designed to work with MEUITM).\n    [*]A Lot of Videos (ALOV) 3.0 (4K) (aims to upscale and remaster all prerendered cutscenes).\n    [*]Faster Elevators 3.0 (doubles the speed of most elevators).\n    [*]Mass Effect Mouse Fix (disables mouse acceleration).\n    [*]Mass Effect Overwritten 0.4 (a collection of subtle textual modifications for a more consistent, immersive, Mass Effect experience).\n    [*]Mass Effect Restored Light & Illumination Natively (MERLIN) (aims to restore dynamic lights and post processing to Xbox 360 levels. It also corrects other things broken in the PC port and some things broken in all releases of \tMass Effect (bug fixes).\n    [*]Mass Effect Updated/Improved Textures Mod (MEUITM) (Mass Effect HD texture overhaul).\n    [*]ME1 Recalibrated 2.32 (this fixes a number of unresolved issues with Mass Effect).\n    [*]Pinnacle Station Tweaks 0.6 (reduces difficulty of Pinnacle Station Hunt scenarios on Insanity to make it possible to win, known bug).\n    [*]Saren Stages 1.0 (aims to both resolve and add to Saren's transformation throughout the game using hand created new meshes and HD textures)\n[/list]\nMost of these can be found either on Nexus Mods (https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect) or through the PCGamingWiki page (https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Mass_Effect) along with many other suggestions and tweaks. With some of these, installation order is important - the texture mods need to go last and will not allow the game to be modified further after installation. The PCGamingWiki page has more information; installation can be quite complex, but is worth the effort.\n\nWhile the two DLCs released for Mass Effect are not available on Steam, they can be added by following the below guide (all credit to OP):\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519913125[/url]\nBring Down the Sky is pretty good; Pinnacle Station is just a distraction and does not add too much into the game, but is nice to have nonetheless.\n\nMass Effect is a truly meaningful/moving game in which you get deeply attached to your characters, and see the consequences of your choices as you play through the trilogy. Many games on Steam are tagged with \"choices matter\" - but in Mass Effect, choices really do matter. Actions can decide who lives or dies, who joins you on the final missions, who you alienate and turn from ally to enemy, or from enemy to ally. Not all consequences are immediately apparent, but choices are revealed and play out as the series progresses.\n\nIf you have not played Mass Effect before, you will probably be better served by purchasing the Legendary Edition and grabbing the whole trilogy. If this is not your first trip to the Citadel - it may not have aged quite as well as its successors, but is still an outstanding game worth another playthrough.\n\nPlayed on Windows 11 Pro x64 with some issues and crashes - nothing game breaking, but annoying nonetheless.

Within just 34 years humanity becomes a major player in galactic politics, human colonies are established on multiple planets, Humanities scientists contribute to groundbreaking discoveries across all aspects of galactic life. Whether you love them or hate them, humanity is here to stay and determined to make its mark in this vast and dynamic galaxy.\n\nEnter Commander Shepard, the embodiment of humanity\u2019s spirit and a highly decorated and dedicated soldier for the Systems Alliance. When humanity takes its next step forward on the galactic stage, Shepard is chosen as the first human Spectre, a special tactics force tasked with missions of paramount importance and given the authority to complete them by any means necessary.\n\nAboard the SSV Normandy, a cutting-edge starship equipped with an experimental stealth drive, Commander Shepard is presented with an opportunity to showcase their exceptional skills on a covert mission. The objective is to escort ancient technology recently discovered on the human colony of Eden Prime, which holds enormous scientific potential for the entire galaxy. The discovery of the ancient beacon was supposed to be kept secret, the situation quickly spirals out of control when the colony is ambushed by the Geth, a race of artificially intelligent machines, who until now have remained isolated in their own section of the galaxy and they seem intent on destroying the beacon. As Shepard rushes to save the colonists of Eden Prime and protect the ancient beacon, they become embroiled in a sinister plot that threatens to bring about the downfall of the entire galaxy.\n\nI first played Mass Effect when the PC version was released. I was immediately enthralled, It felt like the game was made specifically for me tailored expertly to my interests. To begin I created my bald Commander Shepard and set out to explore the Milky Way with a spirit of discovery, a commitment to morality and justice armed with a keen sense of diplomacy. I loved the feeling that my choices mattered and I was having a significant impact on the galaxy.\n\nThe galaxy of Mass Effect is home to a vast array of fascinating alien species, each with its own rich history and culture. From the hulking Elcor to the pressure-suited Volus, each species is distinct and expertly crafted by BioWare, the game\u2019s developer. I found myself spending as much time as possible learning all I could about these unique cultures. Despite their physically diminutive appearance, the Volus proved to be a force to be reckoned with in the galaxy, using their economic prowess to shape the standard galactic currency. Although the Volus are not prominently featured in the first Mass Effect game, their inclusion serves as a testament to the care and attention to detail that BioWare put into creating this rich and immersive universe.\n\nThe worlds that I explored on Shepard\u2019s journey were visually stunning. I was particularly enamored with the secret research base operating outside the jurisdiction of the galactic government on the planet Noveria. The view of the raging snowstorm from the cozy corporate offices was particularly memorable, as I\u2019ve always had a fondness for snow-covered environments in video games. Another standout location is Ilos, which is littered with ancient ruins and alien statues dedicated to long-deceased heroes.\n\nThe recently released Mass Effect Legendary Edition allows players to experience the entire Mass Effect trilogy. Although the mechanics of the first game, which is the focus of this review, may not have aged as well as other aspects of the series, it remains an essential component of the overall narrative. While some may appreciate the combat system, I found it to be clunky and unengaging. However, all other elements of the game are masterfully crafted and to fully appreciate the trilogy, it is worth playing through the first game despite its shortcomings in the combat department.", "timestamp_created": 1673918291, "timestamp_updated": 1673918291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130864170": {"recommendationid": "130864170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055300822", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 205, "playtime_forever": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1393, "last_played": 1461641877}, "language": "english", "review": "Great sci-fi TPS with RPG elements.

Now with the highly flashy Remaster containing the whole trilogy on the store at a more or less constantly reduced price I found myself pondering between replaying the old game or taking a bite at the fully remastered edition.. I also realized I never got around to reviewing this legendary title back in the days so here goes nothing. \n\nIn Mass Effect you take the role of Commander Shepard, malleable hero of humanity with a quite flexible past all for your roleplaying desires. Personally I choose to play femshep infiltrator in the first two runs since I assumed sneaky gameplay and planting headshots like a spaceborn Legolas was my forte. You have a character customization screen where you can choose between a few utterly horrid gnarly military style visages, it works but I can't say that it offers you a lot in the way of customization still A for effort. The rest of the game can be boiled down to a pretty great Star Trek: Next Generation season where you alternate between shipboard activities and sending your most valuable redshirts/crewmembers on away missions to complete objectives and find objects, mostly new guns, in an ever expanding universe of wonder. There is also  a RPG-ish talent tree that includes weapons, hacking, biotics, charm and much more but frankly this is a game where you can't bypass all the combat so some points in your main shooter are needed.\n\nOn your way through the galaxy you pick up a rag-tag gang of intriguing characters like an intergalactic nursing home. Every character is different and truly contributes to their own personality and quirks and as time goes by you end up choosing the same two most of the missions since they are \u201cyour\u201d team. The standard gameplay is a generic cover based shooter that was a common sight in the elden time and it still works. Be aware that the difficulty does not amplify the AI\u2019s tactical prowess but gives them layer upon layer of health that you have to snipe away with the many guns you find dropping out of everything and its mother. The constant dressup of the characters is frankly a chore so I would heartily recommend anyone giving this a go to crank down the difficulty and play it mainly for the story. Some of the missions let you pilot the worst interplanetary sandcrawler ever constructed and the random planetary treasure hunts that fill out the galaxy are quite dull. \n\nNow the meat of this game is the storytelling and it is grand! The game begins with a short side mission at a colony that's gone dark and in the end spans a galactic council, it's not so secret police, a horrible threat from beyond the stars, lost alien civilisations and much more. This is a game that you have to experience first hand and it is truly a momentous gaming experience even though the gunplay is pretty mediocre. There are few games I wish I could just wipe from my mind so I could experience them again and Mass Effect is for sure one of those games.\n", "timestamp_created": 1672338066, "timestamp_updated": 1672338066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605793654918670654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129614570": {"recommendationid": "129614570", "author": {"steamid": "76561199117770519", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1331, "last_played": 1672338129}, "language": "spanish", "review": "puedes coger con aliens", "timestamp_created": 1672330287, "timestamp_updated": 1672330287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129613704": {"recommendationid": "129613704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077656449", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1673283822}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, old-school FPS.", "timestamp_created": 1672329542, "timestamp_updated": 1672329542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459081858396530151", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129605951": {"recommendationid": "129605951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048268625", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1692990823}, "language": "english", "review": "A sci-fi classic for good reason and the pinnacle of the Mass Effect trilogy. It features incredible world-building and atmosphere, great companions and the best antagonist in the series, only lagging behind its two sequels in terms of interactions with the other characters (ME2 adds context and extra details to their stories and ME3 especially features lots of different optional conversations and interactions that flesh them out even more) and, this is the big one, in terms of combat. \n\nThe combat system for ME1:LE was heavily reworked and with good reason. Between Shepard's inexcusably poor accuracy, shaky sniper aiming and the Mako's infamous controls, jank permeates this game's combat. Coming from three full playthroughs of ME:LE, I had a pretty good tolerance to and even enjoy ME1's jank but not everyone will.\n\nStill, this is absolutely worth picking up if you've enjoyed LE and want to experience the OG titles, problems and all.

time; my hesitation came from the fact that it was made by EA(!) and that it probably won't hold up to current standards. Then there was a major sale about 2 weeks ago, and I was torn between Jedi: Fallen Order and Mass Effect 1. I debated my options for a good 2-3 days. Finally decided that this classic is probably what I really need right now.\n\nAnd I'm so glad I bought Mass Effect! While the gameplay, at least some parts of it, may not have aged all that well, I'm pleased to say that everything else is quite stellar. I'm not a fan of the shooter genre, but the gameplay was good enough to keep me engaged. The graphics look pretty amazing, and the game runs pretty well on Steam Deck, with some minor hiccups that are easily rectified.  The characters and the story is definitely the strongest feature here. I got really invested in knowing all about my crew and made it a habit of checking up on them after every mission. Everyone has a surprising depth to their characters that not caring about them is very difficult.\n\nAll in all, I'm very excited to see what more this world has to show and to return to my dear friends on board the Normandy.", "timestamp_created": 1671419991, "timestamp_updated": 1671419991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128795045": {"recommendationid": "128795045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068212274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1671371585}, "language": "english", "review": "Warning: Slight spoilers and discontent ahead\n\u00a0\nOriginally, I didnt want to write this review because it's mostly going to be negative and because everyone seems to love this series, so I thought it wouldn't help anyone.\nHowever, now after several hours of unsuccesfully trying to first get my own and then someone else's ME1 savegames imported for ME2 (classic, not LE), the game wont help me either so screw that.\n\nME1 is a crappy game.\n\nI know it's an old game and might not live up to modern players' expectations, but I grew up with old Bioware games and neither Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Jade Empire nor KOTOR were crappy games/game series, even if you dig them out today. Only recently I played KOTOR II with the Lost Content Mod and enjoyed it way more than ME1, although KOTOR2 is not nearly as good as the first one...\n\nBut let's get to ME1:\n\nPros:\n+ a few interesting stories and decisions behind main quests\n+ interesting world and lore\n+ Wrex is a cool guy\n+ the game has an end\n+ the end is quite dramatic and I like the enemy they emancipate\n\nCons:\n- boring planets and bases on planets that basically are all the same (remember the nicely designed surroundings in JE, remember the how amazing it was to enter Baldurs Gate for the first time?)\n- catastrophic driving physique on planets (remember the fun races in KOTOR?)\n- most side quests are super boring without a remembarable story and sometimes you don't even realize/are properly informed when you completed one (remember the murders you could solve in BG2? Man, I felt like freaking Sherlock himself!)\n- most interaction with your party NPCs is not organically included in the regular game flow, but takes only place on your ship and feels more like an MMORPG fetch quest (remember the first time Aerie came to you before resting, Jaheira mourning Khalid or all of a sudden complaining that you're too nice to Viconia?)\n- the most stupidly placed NPC ever in the tunnels of Feros -> a guy called Ian standing 5 meters away from enemies without being noticed or killed although being obviously crazy and screaming all the time\n- fights arent tactic or exciting at all (remember preparing for a dragon fight and the glorious feeling of winning it in BG2?)\n- as a result, leveling up does not feel exciting as well.. (remember saving every time you had a level up in BG to frantically max out your char?)\n- all weapons are basically the same, some just do more damage, you don't even see how they look when you buy or loot them, so no motivation at all in the item system (remember the many unique, great looking weapons in BG1+2 with their own lore?)\n- inventory management is horrible, if you have too many items you need to dismantle them item by item, click by click, and you will get spammed with items.. (remember the different bags and containers in BG2 that fulfill all your horder's dreams so that you never have to leave cool stuff behind? Or simply marking several items in a shop to sell them all at once O_O)\n- besides Wrex and to some degree the Lady with the long name, I did not find my party that interesting.. (HK47, Bastilla, Minsk, Yoshimo, Wild Flower & Chai Ka... You know the drill ;( )\n- It's just not fun and I only kept playing because of all the praise the series has received and my respect for old Bioware games..\n\n\nAnd now I sit here, having put 30+ hours into this piece of whatever and cannot use my files for the second part (tbh I guess this is an Origin/EA topic cause I played it there and they switched systems when I was in the midst of playing it..).\nThe beginning of part 2 kinda depicts how I feel now.. and what's even worse, I have to stick with that racist Ashley, because somehow saving her (despite her asking to be sacrificed!) seems to be the standard choice instead of saving the way cooler (but still kinda lame) Kaidan...\n\u00a0\nOn the upside the first gameplay of ME2 is already way better than ME1 so maybe, hopefully I will be redeemed for my suffering soon.", "timestamp_created": 1671371772, "timestamp_updated": 1671371772, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474738866090774536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128595821": {"recommendationid": "128595821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198875489397", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1038, "last_played": 1671839734}, "language": "english", "review": "if you want to experience the first game of the whole franchise then go ahead, some aspects of the game mostly how guns work are very hard to play with, especially for new players but most of the game is quite enjoyable.

You can start and play the games fine, but when trying to get the DLC it becomes a big hassle. The DLC is free, but they're not offered on Steam so you have to go to an external EA website to aquire them and install them manually. It worked for me at first with ME2 being the one giving the most issues, but when I tried to re-install ME1 I no longer can install the DLC and as far as I've been able to find out this is more so because it's the Steam version since the DLC's aren't included. It just feels EA/Bioware punish players who buy these games on Steam.\n\nIf you want to play through the story I recommend getting the Legendary Edition as you get everything in one easy package with little hassle.

In the 24th century, humans are now interstellar travellers. We recently discovered the advanced technology of an extinct civilisation, known as the Protheans, on Mars. This technology is known as \"mass effect\" technology, capable of changing the mass properties of matter. With this technology, faster-than-light travel is possible, as well as a a whole host of technological advancements.\n\nThe whole galaxy is now within humanity's reach. That said, humans are not the first race to discover this Prothean technology. Many alien races have previously made this discovery. Before the humans arrived, the three most influential of which have previously formed a council to govern galactic affairs.\n\nHumanity, of course, want more say in galactic politics, including (eventually) a seat at the council, but not everyone is impressed. Some humans fear that council membership will sacrifice autonomy, and some aliens are fearful or envious of humanity's grab for power.\n\nThis is what Mass Effect does best: Bioware's world-building is impressive, possibly the best I've seen in a game. Bioware pumps the game full of lore and history, as well as a multitude of alien species, each with their own history and culture. The races themselves are also richly drawn, with Bioware refusing to reduce any race into one single trait. Those curious about the world and its inhabitants will find enormous number codex entries, that flesh out the world beyond the surface interactions. Somebody obviously poured a lot of love into creating this world.\n\nThe storytelling and dialogue are also well-written. Characters are reasonably well-drawn, and mostly interesting.\n\nSo where does it go wrong? The further you stray from the writing, the more lackluster Mass Effect becomes. The whole game smacks of a labour of love, filled with worthy ideas, that was hamstrung by a miserly budget.\n\nSomeone clearly had good ideas about how to handle combat, including a squad system and neat tech/biotic powers, but they weren't implemented in a way that made the game any more fun to play. Constantly pausing to use powers or order team mates tended to kill the pace and tension of combat, so I tended not to use these features, and instead opted for the bland, vanilla gunplay.\n\nSomeone also had the idea of allowing the player to explore the galaxy as they chose. Visit any of the 20 or so star systems, and you'll find a bunch of orbiting planets. Usually, you can even land and explore one of these planets in a vehicle!\n\nIt sounds fantastic, but it really is not. What you get a small, bare, procedurally-generated landscape of peaks and troughs. Don't expect anything like plant life. Occasionally, there'll be one species of copy-paste fauna for you to drive over accidentally. Other than that, you'll get a few copy-paste buildings, containing copy-paste interiors and copy-paste enemies, to fulfil a copy-paste mission that you only get when you fly to the star system.\n\nI cannot overstate how incredibly dull and not worth your time exploring these planets are. I would only recommend it to people who complain about Ubisoft's or Bethesda's open worlds being bland, just you can appreciate how much worse things could be!\n\nThe planets connected with the game's few main missions are usually better thought out and more interesting. If you are going to play this game, this would be my firm recommendation: as much as possible, don't stray from the main mission. You may need to do some side missions to grind your level up, if things are difficult, but DO NOT approach this game with a completionist mindset!\n\nI often found, as well, that the game would resort to a tell-don't-show mindset all too often. I found, for example, an old Prothean site on one of the various bland planets you could explore. I hopped out, and interacted with it. I then got three text messages pop up on screen (each with a single dismiss button) that outlined, in brief, some visions that my character was having. In most AAA games, this would have been a breathtaking cinematic. In Mass Effect, it's a wall of text, laid over the sight of your character standing there, doing nothing. Again, with a better budget, this game could have been so much more.\n\nInventory management sucks as well. You get to carry 150 items, that's it. After that, new items are converted to a relatively useless substance called Omni-gel (useful for when you suck at hacking, or the rare occasion where your vehicle is damaged in the field). Selling items is possible, but a pain in the neck. You don't get to sort items into categories, and you only get to compare equipment you're selling with what your current squad has equipped. It makes it very difficult to see what you should or should not be selling. Getting the notification, in the middle of a mission, that you're running low on space (i.e. when your inventory is 90% full) is frustrating and a little demotivating.\n\nI'm writing this after my second attempt to get through the game. I played it again, remembering how much I enjoyed the first part of the game, but not really remembering why I stopped playing. Once again, I find myself in a position where I just don't want to play any more. I don't think I'll ever finish this game. It's just not worth it.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n\nThe world-building is amazing, the writing is good, the combat is OK (but bland), and the side-missions/exploration is just incredibly bad.

The options of dialogue and the possible outcomes of certain quests. I only played this title once, because when I first bought it in 2014 or so, it would crash at the same point in the story repeatetly. Unfortunately for me, I didn't like all the quests with multiple endings, but most of them. There are some weird mechanics in the game, like it's implementation of money. This sounds odd, but there aren't really any useful items to buy in shops. Mainly, because there aren't many shops at all. Throughout the entire game, I stumbled upon 3 shops and bought 2 types of armor. That's it. The gameplay is fine, but you cannot switch to a controller. The skill system is also quite confusing. For some reason, you can be proficient with the shotgun, but you only unlock it, after putting a certain amount of points into pistols. Half-way through, I forgot, that there even are any skills, which might underline the role they play within the game. The game itsself is quite easy with some frustrating checkpoints, so you'll be needing to save now and then. There are also a lot of bugs, but the most notable and infuriating ones are; The camera jumps, whenever your character walks over a slab and the sound of a million footsteps, if you disable the framelock, and your character being incabable of stepping over slabs. The soundtrack is weirdly terrible. As are the soundeffects. The sidecharacters are great and consistent, but unfortunately you cannot romance all of them. All in all, I had a lot of fun, even with all the glitches and flaws and I'm excited for the next game! 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1663439541, "timestamp_updated": 1663439541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122123887": {"recommendationid": "122123887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044046420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1963, "last_played": 1491634516}, "language": "english", "review": "Still one of my favorite games.

Even if it weren't, the bits I was picking up continued to encourage me to get this game. Simply watching it, or listening to it, wasn't enough. Fortunately, the copy I have I got on sale. At first, this game looked like a Halo rip-off. A diverse cast of characters in an action heavy sci-fi-space-opera in which the gamer gets to go around shooting stuff. What I was hearing about this game sounded much more intriguing. Mass Effect has been on the market long enough that finding lower priced copies is easier to come across. This game is just about worth any price point, at least any price point under $100. The concept is inventive without being oppressive or offensive. At least, the way I play. Customizable super powers in a space opera with plausible scientific concepts! That's fun stuff! It's made by the same people who made Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and The Citadel in Mass Effect serves similar purpose as Planet Taris, but with more happening sooner. It's possible the ideas present in this game had been in the heads of the developers before they began work on KOTOR. Any RPG veteran will be accustomed to running into the non-playable characters that you begin to come across more often within half a day's play who ask you the gamer to start getting more active with going about doing random favors. Fortunately, at least, from what I see so far, all that extra stuff doesn't get in the way of experiencing the game's core premise. The more you do of the favors, the more stuff is available, the more interesting the game gets. There are those creative types out there who's experience is taking too long to decide how to customize their character, and find themselves putting the game down before they've actually played 40 minutes of gameplay. This game came out prior to 2010. Even by then, games had gotten sophisticated enough to allow people the option of customizing characters to seemingly no end before getting to so much as the first cutscene. The version I'm playing is not the remastered version that came out prior to 2022, but I don't feel i'm lacking anything. The game looks good and plays nice. The animations look more polished and believable. It's pacing is a little quicker than what we get in KOTOR, and that seems to be part of its strength, pun not quite intended. Your character comes with a brief backstory to help the gamer get into the game more quickly. Things don't really slow down after the first 15 minute threshold. If there are 2 things I would change about the PC version it's the option to use a controller, and a better musical score. Parts of the score are more memorable, but this game needed someone like the composer for the Zelda games, especially Wind Waker, or like Marty O'Donnell, or like Jeremy Soule. Characters are multi-layered. People can still play this game as though they're trying to get a less positive reaction out of other characters, and the main characters still exhibit a certain level of higher honor. I really appreciate how the developers and producers didn't skimp on the writing. If you want to be stylish in this game that is entirely possible, and characters still don't sound like idiots, or bratty. Be prepared for more adult content and adult language. Even if you play in such manner that doesn't always involve getting naked with aliens you're probably bound to come across some stuff that is better projected while there's someone in the room who's at least 17.", "timestamp_created": 1658105018, "timestamp_updated": 1658105018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118981312": {"recommendationid": "118981312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347132666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1659734676}, "language": "english", "review": "Impossible to play due to camera sensitivity issue which seems to be impossible to resolve", "timestamp_created": 1658097270, "timestamp_updated": 1658097270, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118889436": {"recommendationid": "118889436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870045245", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1525, "last_played": 1659483525}, "language": "english", "review": "Renegade", "timestamp_created": 1657952254, "timestamp_updated": 1657952254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118767019": {"recommendationid": "118767019", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992788796", "num_games_owned": 1149, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 4042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1700524619}, "language": "english", "review": "Still so god damn good after all these years \n\nMass Effect 1 was the first game I can remember where I followed every single pre-release news/screenshots/trailers I could and I wasn't disappointed back in 2007 when it came out on 360.\n\nThe atmosphere in ME1 is top notch especially with some good texture mods to bring this more in line with a real remaster.\n\nDon't buy the god awful \"Legendary Edition\" it ruins the lighting and aesthetics this game was striving for and makes some characters look completely different in a bad way.\n\nIf for whatever reason you haven't played this one pick it up and look into how to get some decent vanilla inspired texture mods running and you won't be disappointed, Just be aware that this game is an RPG first and a shooter second so don't expect to shoot every single gun out of the box on any class with pinpoint accuracy.\n\nEasily in my top 20 pick this up if you haven't already", "timestamp_created": 1657745457, "timestamp_updated": 1657745457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45098036527633667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118722923": {"recommendationid": "118722923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043798060", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1564, "last_played": 1691360972}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Sci Fi and RPGs, and still have not played the Mass Effect series, start here.

I was able to enjoy all of the dialogue albeit the text and speech was stuck on Italian, however I was still able to follow the story on my speed run coherently. I would recommend buying this game multiple times in different formats over the span of your life and never really playing it properly. This game is a great expansion from GW on the Ultra Marines chapter and adds essential canonical lore. Den Mother Dahdorah, currently sweeping up my wet glass crummies, said I should mention how I kept getting a stiffy when salaciously portrayed xenos were presented on screen. She is correct as ever and it slightly effected my speed run, but I am a professional in the special 'cold-wet' conditions of my curating. All in all this was quite possibly the most elite squad of hero's I have lead throughout the galaxy. We will never forget all the guys on space game. Especially stand out were all the ones that reminded me of my dad. Well I gotta go fast coz Den Mother needs me to speed run more games.

The main focus puller is its compelling characters. The depths in which they went to flesh out the systems of other alien races, such as their religions, governments, military strategies, and more was superb. I got this game apprehensively after watching my streamer friend Berleezy play it. Thinking I'll just experience it vicariously through him, well that turned out unpreventable, as I got the game and didn't look back. As a new player in the series who completed every side mission except the collectible missions, it felt satisfying unlocking specific dialogue between characters and seeing how thought out the developers made them out to be. Overall a 9/10 game for me since its near-perfect score is hampered by the level design of the side missions.

What makes it shine is the plot as well as its pacing and characters.\n\nThe game only allows playing on \"veteran\" difficulty for a start - 3rd out of 5 difficulties. Each playthrough on the highest possible difficulty allows going one up, plus an achievement. For an actual veteran RPG player that makes it relatively easy for a start, with a few fights making an exception. That's okay though: It's a good way to enjoy the story.\n\nNow if You [i]do[/i] seek a challenge and are a good player You might find combat a little disappointing. Firefights can to be a bit slow unless You choose to storm right in, a cautious approach at times leads to boring 'exploits', the character build system is a bit shallow. You [i]have to[/i] bring two crew members and can't go solo. It's just not a good choice for challenge seeking, so do Yourself a favor and embrace casual play with a great story.\n\nLoot is a bit weird - You'll get flooded with items, most of which are higher tiers of the same or even outright useless. That's okay, although reequipping the squad all the time do to the quickly progressing tiers of all the equipment remains somewhere between the joy of looting and busy work.\n\nWhat's awesome here is that all the different aspects of the game are fun. A bit casual and flawed if looking deeper, but hey: It's not about that. Advancing is fun, even if the builds aren't super deep. Looting is fun, even if there's a lot of inventory clutter. Fights are fun, even if a powerful tactical approach may lead to the exposure of the somewhat silly foundations of the system. It's all fun and casual and that's why nothing distracts from plot events and characters - the true strength of the game. \n\nAs always being the bad guy is a bit weird and only supported half-heartedly by the game, but then You are supposed to be the good guy anyway. Why not?\n\nIt might make sense to slightly modify the game through the config files for a few QoL issues, as well as activating the console. The latter allows to disable lighting, because sadly there is a part of the game that might have lighting bug out on modern machines (characters become black blobs). I found that easy and there's guides on how to do that.\n\nYou can import a character You play through with to Mass Effect 2 (and then ME3). Honestly though? Me2 tries to fix all the various issues I described and that does not go so well. A question of taste perhaps, but I for one did not like it and I find myself in good company there. Like XCOM tried to up the pace of slow crawl combat with turn timers (which many players hated) ME2 likewise tries to up the pace of combat in their own way as I read it, but for me it felt forced and kind of ruined the game. \nEnjoy this one and if You do: temper Your expectations, get ME2 on sale perhaps and go into it with an open mind. \nThis game is too good for it to be easy to follow up on.\n\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed a casual playthrough, almost like a brilliant interactive novel.

There are a number of cut scenes that don't give you a chance to save. This meant I couldn't even progress in the game due to the crashes. Fix attempts included re-installing the game multiple times, running steam as an admin, running the game as an admin, running the game in xp/vista/win 7 compatibility modes, disabling full screen optimizations,  downloading large address aware, changing every graphics setting, installing the 2 DLC packs form EA's website, downloading Physx, installing bug fix mods, console command to increase game speed, making edits to windows virtual memory settings, and setting FPS limits. Some of these seemed to prolong the time between the crashes or make the game feel a bit smoother without fully fixing the issue.

My initial impression was \"meh\". Okay but nothing special.\n\nSo glad I gave it another try recently. I'm now well and truly in deep and absolutely loving it! Okay so its not the best looking game, but what do you expect for a game thats 14 years old? The release of the Legendary version should help address that.\n\nBut the absolute best thing about this game is the story and characters. It plays more like an interstellar detective story, as you embark on various missions, chasing leads, searching for artefacts and helping (or hunting) various people along the way.\n\nFor people that love shooters, the battle sequences can be a bit samey and there aren't many tactics, besides using your special abilities at the right times and taking cover whenever you can. Other than that its mostly mashing the fire button. While you can order your squad mates to move, you can't make any use of their abilities. Vehicles such as the Mako, for planetary exploration do add some variety.\n\nDeveloping your character's abilities and those of your squad is quite satisfying, as is upgrading your loadouts, when you acquire new weapons, armour etc.\n\nThere is a LOT of talking to do to a wide range of NPCs that feature heavily throughout the game. Necessary both to obtain new missions and earn XP. Some may find this boring, but for me it provides a nice break from the shooting.\n\nMy main gripe about this game is the movement, which feels slow and laboured when you frequently have to travel long distances on foot. The Mako (an armed all-terrain vehicle) doesn't feel all that fast in the open terrain settings...although it sure beats walking.\n\nIf you can get past a few minor drawbacks, its a great, absorbing game that will eat up large chunks of your free time.", "timestamp_created": 1642518968, "timestamp_updated": 1642518968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571971535682678223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108142706": {"recommendationid": "108142706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035343891", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7746, "last_played": 1642353306}, "language": "english", "review": "yes, very nice game!

Riding high off of the success of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, the developer eagerly created an original science fiction setting with aliens, characters, worlds and lore that are genuinely captivating. The world of Mass Effect, and the history of the alien races and the politics of their interactions really draw the player into the fabric of Mass Effect's story.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the world building of Mass Effect does the heavy lifting, because post-KOTOR Bioware seemed to constantly struggle when it came to balanced gameplay. Combat in this game feels so shallow and the other party members seem so useless that I came to dread any enemy engagement that I approached. Dragon Age: Origins was worse, and the ME sequels did improve a smidge, but for all that the original Mass Effect has been celebrated for, especially in the realm of Western RPGs, its flaws are glaring and they will turn some people off for sure. I have not played the newer rerelease, but I am certain that Bioware relished the chance to go back and tweak things.\n\nI said once in a gaming forum long ago that Bioware games weren't necessarily good storytelling, but they were great wish fulfillment. I concede that that's really a matter of personal taste. You can certainly enjoy Mass Effect for the story, bland as I personally think it is. You may even enjoy the story enough that the gameplay flaws don't matter to you.

Flying through the Terminus Systems and bring the good fight to the Reapers and their Geth Minions gave me a new sense of purpose. Quitting C-Sec was the best decision I ever made.\nThe Commander, Sheppard, was a bit of a clot at first, he only took me on because he realized that I would be an asset to the Normandy and we could share resources in our hunt for Saren. We even managed to take down the Rogue Specter and defend the Citadel from a Reaper invasion. \nBy the end, we grew to be fast friends, and I was really saddened to hear of his death while patrolling near Alchera. \nHe will be remembered.\n\nThe armory was fairly sub standard and they kept overheating, so we needed to keep our heads down a lot. \nBut here's the big question:\nCan the weapons be calibrated?\nYes!

One of the most IMPORTANT for the many things it tried to do, and successfully accomplished.\n\nThe skill & tactical combat system is amazing. It's somewhat difficult to get a feel for at first, but you get the hang of it around 25%-50% of the way through the game (earlier if you're quicker on your feet than me). You can issue many orders instantly, as though you're merely thinking about them and able to execute them in an instant. This leads to many different tactical situations: you could quickly pull an endangered teammate out of harm's way to give them a chance to heal while you and your other squadmate cover them. You can use special abilities of yourself and your teammates against specific targets. Even the weapons and the mods you use are very important depending on the situation.\n\nThe subplot of political intrigue and shady business dealings...gives me an impression of a fully explored, immersive universe that has been extremely well thought-out. Dare I say, the level of a \"fleshed out\" feeling this game gives me about its own story, meta, lore, flavor, and otherwise tellings of its universe to me rivals even the likes of Star Wars and Star Trek. It's THAT good, THAT complex, and THAT compelling and complete that you're hard-pressed to find a comparable experience anywhere. The only other games that come to mind are any of the latter Elder Scrolls games (Morrowind to Skyrim); Morrowind and Oblivion were released before Mass Effect, but neither could match the complexity and scale of Mass Effect.\n\nEven the dialogue system makes your interactions more complex: things you say and do on one planet will have wide and far-reaching repercussions everywhere. This is by far most apparent when you give a news interview to a reporter presenting the broadcast to trillions of people across the galaxy. There you are, controlling Shepard, making dialogue decisions that will have ramifications such that they touch the lives of people everywhere. Even THIS is something never before explored anywhere: the complexity involved in artfully negotiating a press conference to your own advantage. There just simply isn't any other game that offers a simulation of that specific experience, and that's only one of a thousand of different experience-simulations in this game.\n\nI am really struggling to describe this game, the experience it gave me, and the impression it left with. I'll just conclude this review by saying this:\n\nThe is one of the most important games ever made. The 2007 edition will be eclipsed by later editions for graphics, DLC, and possibly some bug fixes, but you really need to at least play this edition of the game.\n\nIt's important for all of the reasons I described above, and more. It does a lot of things prior games tried, and did them better in addition to going its own way. You NEED to play this if you love games. You NEED to play this if you respect the history of gaming in general. You NEED to play this, as the air you breathe and the water you drink are vital to your body, so is this vital to your life's experience as a game.\n\nI loved this game so much, I even went and bought the Legendary edition after I played it - which includes THIS game re-mastered, leaving me owning BOTH editions - and even bought Mass Effect 2 because my current computer can play that NOW while a future computer will be more capable of running the Remastered edition.\n\nMy score: 95 out of 100. There were a few minor bugs; one was Benezia constantly throwing me *through* walls and forcing me to re-load my game several times. The Mako's control system was a little wacky: not game-breakingly so, but it broke the immersion for me. Some of the ! flags for quests were not in the proper location, or didn't go away after I completed the quest. Also, most of the combat involving the Mako was easy. That's it. Aside from some minor complaints, and one bug with a workaround, my experience was as technically and artistically perfect as possible.\n\ntl;dr\n\nGO BUY THIS GAME.

To me the hype around this game derives from the lack of Sci-Fi-RPGs.\nFirst of, the characters lack any depth. Shephard can just be played as \"yeaah, i love everything!Woof Woof!\" German Shepherd, \"I dont care\" stubborn Shepherd or \"Fuck me, I`m edgy\" teeny Shepherd. The dialogues are often a cringefest, supported by the lack of cineastic camera shots and sometimes astonishing bad sound mixing. The romances are even cringier. The writing of this game is a complete mess. \nMoreover, the level design suffers from recycling and lack of dimensionality. Its just : Drive/walk to that point, kill the randomly spawned enemies every 150-200m, move on and repeat. Moreover the levels themselves are quite boring to look at and lack most of time interesting views.\n Combined with my truely dumb artificial friends, who often just stand around to get killed by the AI, if the AI itself didnt declare war to the wall it stood behind (which often enough happens), you get an overly underwhelming gaming experience. The shooting part is just complete bullocks, very frustrating and feels like a non-ironic version of \"Crazy Chicken\".\nOn the plus side, the soundtrack is good. The main theme is quite amazing, the other tracks are most of the time ok and fit the theme. \n", "timestamp_created": 1632590550, "timestamp_updated": 1632590550, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549549520015716553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99945391": {"recommendationid": "99945391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198888181256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 705, "last_played": 1664774131}, "language": "english", "review": "ive loved this game since it first came out on xbox.

Played it multiple times through when it came out, was one of those comforting periods where you could just get absorbed into that world. Having a lot of elements from classic scifi-fantasy like Star Wars, Firefly, Halo, LOTR, Lovecraftian horror, even Star Trek with a picture of a future where species try to cooperate and can thrive as a result, having hope for progress. It's derivative sure, but inspired. And even if no single element is perfectly implemented, there's just so much working together to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe ambitious creation of an elaborated space opera, filled with all the world building, story pacing, highs and lows of characters and events, twists and revelations, music elevating every scene, packed in a visually memorable and beautiful environment stealing all the best aspects from other scifi and fantasy that have remained timeless, without becoming too cluttered or clashing in competing styles. Not to mention the effort, resources gone to voice acting, making all the events and decisions feel important even if just a well crafted magic trick with little consequences, but knowing that an important part of making it all feel grand and significant is letting players get a sense of everything, placing everything there to entice a player to delve deeper, spend time learning about the world and its characters.\nOne thing I think is a perfect example of this was how even the main Codex entries had voiced narration, to lower the threshold for you to just sit back for a moment, let your eyes rest a bit, and still have an easier opportunity to experience and hear about the game when you need a small break. Reading on a screen in usually clunky UI is less appealing to read than just flipping a physical books pages that doesn't shine in your eyes, makes it always feel like a waste in other RPGs in even devoting resources to writing all that elaborate lore, something more developers should be mindful of, as it's not accidental how people tend to enjoy their books either physically or in audio book form these days over a PDF on a glowing screen.\nThe voice actors, music, design in art, use of Unreal Engine 3 coloured lighting and shading, all the locations, history, framing of conversations in that cinematic way, even the galaxy map and just going around systems checking on planets, investigating, small side stories to flesh out the world - Things that keep it together and make it one of those RPGs that create a sense of being in some vast world saving the galaxy one adventure after another.\n\nThere are many places that do show their age. \nThe animations are a bit stiff, there's a limited amount of them, that does put a dent into conversations as all characters use the same pool of animations, removing a lot of individuality, they lack a lot of important facial expressions, the gestures get repetitive, and the sharp resets of animation cycles can look offputting these days. And the dialogue is serviceable, but not particularly excellently written or quotable. \nHowever like I said, I feel that almost paradoxically, the amount of resources and time spent on it, all the hours of dialogue, you being in those situations animated and filmed like you were in a big Star Wars-esque movie, that still manages to keep its aging parts sown together to make a good scene, being as corny and cheesy as those space operas can be, but with just so much more, bigger and grander, music elevating it as well, all of this in a way comes back around to make it stand above the issues present.\nThe combat is an acquired taste. It's a bit clunky, the cover system is... Interesting, the shooting is passable, inventory system is awkward and the loot blends together, the AI is meh. \nBut still, having a pausing command hud that lets you think about your encounter, using party member abilities, your own, the overall look and feel of a combat encounter, often in big backdrops of significant events and large skirmishes going around you, and the weapon and ability effects are fun and the ragdolls hilarious. \nIf you feel that the combat is still frustrating, then some simple config ini editing can make that easier.\nThe Galaxy map, exploration, could also use some QoL tweaks, one thing I didn't like was how if you went into a system, looked at a planet, but wanted to refresh your memory on a quests details, what it was about, exact location on cluster->system->planet, you had to zoom out of the planet, zoom out of the system, zoom out of the cluster, zoom out of the galaxy map, and then enter your journal to check up on your assignment entries.\nThe best fix for this currently is to just read your journal always first, and maybe just have the galaxy map tracker mod to bypass needs of spending time looking at all the systems while keeping in mind details of all three nested locations.\nAnd the famous planet exploration with the Mako. To be fair, a part of me actually kind of likes it, some planets feel neat, the skyboxes with usually nice sunsets or orbiting moons, the way in the horizon it all hits you so vividly, some of the lazy landscape geometry comes together to create a pretty vista in the distance. But the geometry of the environment is lacklustre, and doesn't feel like it was properly tested to see if it actually feels any good with the Mako to drive in. There are parts where the physics of the mako and the environments do actually feel nice to traverse in, but those are rare, and mostly you're fighting against physics, game engine quirks and geometry. Coupled with how unnecessarily large the areas are, and how slowly compared to that your Mako moves, doesn't help.\nAlso a lot of recycled assets, indoor locations in these side areas for assignments.\n\nBut despite all of these, still, after all these years, I pushed through, because I enjoyed the world, the Galaxy, the game is not trying to make you miserable by design for who you are and what you can do as Shepard, it's the equivalent of a power fantasy for roleplaying, where you're not beaten down for being flawed no matter what choice you make, it's not a game limiting you to only one bad road after another and then scolding you for playing the game, you are a hero like in all those stories that people go back to time and time again because real life makes you feel powerless and shitty about your decisions enough already. Is it simple, corny? Sure, like power fantasies usually are. Yet, it's an evergreen classic journey we like to fantasize about.\n\nPlayed on a 6+ years old potato laptop (i7-4710HQ, 840M, 12GB RAM), lots of ini editing to get the best out of visuals, but no HD mods, only MERLIN, game ran at a stable 60fps for like 95% of the game.\nThe PC port is its biggest weakness. Coming into this these days, it's better to prepare yourself to almost treat this as a Bethesda title.\nMeaning you should first thing visit PCGamingWiki, Steam Guides, nexusmods, go through a very specific order of setting up your experience.\n(Start game once, quit, follow guide for making sure CD keys work, then install DLC, then get ME3Tweaks Mod Manager, install through that ME1Recalibrated first, then some stuff to smooth out less ideal systems like charted worlds, I recommend, maybe Galaxy Map Tracker, HD textures and videos if you like, after that I suggest MERLIN: Mass Effect Restored Light & Illumination Natively Mod, and then maybe some config ini editing if you feel comfortable with that.)\nEven then, you can expect some minor issues here and there.\n(Had framedrops on Noveria, Ilos, and some planet surfaces, and black stretching lines on a few planet surface objects.)\n\nDoubt I'll get the Legendary Edition despite my love for Mass Effect, not until they remove Origin DRM. This is still playable and enjoyable, as long as you feel that it's worth the effort to get an optimal experience.

Taking covers, flanking enemies, using extra abilities and so on.\n\nThere is also a non fighting part of the game that includes story telling, quest solving, speaking to NPC's. Also there is a part of the game where you are onboard of your ship where you can interact with your team and find out more about them.

old game. There.. that's that out of the way. Now you'll be aware that the graphics and controls are perhaps not as slick as something that came out this year.\nHaving said that, a lot of modern games could learn some lessons from the original Mass Effect in terms of story, dialogue, and inventory/modding.\n\nA lot of people criticise Mass Effect for having a convoluted inventory and weapons modding system. Personally I liked it. I felt that it had depth, and offered specific tailoring for weapons and abilities, in a way that later versions did not. \nWhile a bit more button pressing and fiddling through menus was required than in M.E 2 or 3, I liked that my progression was so visually represented and that options allowed me to level up weapons and abilities in the way I wanted to.\n\nControls will take a while to adjust to after playing the far slicker 2 or 3, but once the old (newer) ways have been unlearnt, they're easy enough to manage. The Mako (space buggy) admittedly has some pretty awful controls, but again, it's just a matter of getting used to it (and knowing how much it's going to skid, as the handling is quite unresponsive).\n\nCharacter models are pretty good for the time, as is character development. For me one of the biggest drawbacks was how samey a lot of the areas were in any of the incidental locations. (anywhere that wasn't written for with notable plot.. the variety is far superior in 2 and 3).  While it stands up the first time, it can become repetitive on a second playthrough.\n\nRegular players of FPS are likely to find the combat underwhelming due to finding it over-simplified. But I think that more people will be playing this for the RPG aspects and story. And that is where this game excels. It is damn near impossible to not get involved in the story, and to not care about your team (well, most of them). \nWhile the shorter length means the game is not quite so fleshed out as 2 or 3, that doesn't mean that scenarios are less impactful. The game builds the whole way through and I found end game to be dramatic and rewarding. It's a perfect set up to the later games, and one that is definitely worth playing if you enjoyed the worlds that were built.\n\nDownsides? ..Will raise questions about Mass Effect 2.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1629115294, "timestamp_updated": 1629115294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97572150": {"recommendationid": "97572150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282743763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 591, "last_played": 1513547348}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ya no se hacen juegos con historia tan buena como este", "timestamp_created": 1628973678, "timestamp_updated": 1628973678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97560162": {"recommendationid": "97560162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967627329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1640105782}, "language": "english", "review": "so cool", "timestamp_created": 1628959279, "timestamp_updated": 1628959279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97472997": {"recommendationid": "97472997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085984689", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 3038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3038, "last_played": 1488458219}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an old school Bioware game.

I need more depth, not just in the story (there are plenty of amazing stories) but in CONTEXT. And this game doesn't offer any at all. You are this guy, doing this thing, in some sci-fi landscape. Neat. Why should I care? I want to. I just don't. \n\nI totally understand (and appreciate) the setting. It's really cool. I love the universe. But I simply don't give a ****.\n\nYou should dip your toes in and see if you like it, or if it hooks you.", "timestamp_created": 1626578299, "timestamp_updated": 1626732885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95925103": {"recommendationid": "95925103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349904096", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1626557802}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't get the game to work with an XBox controller even when loading profiles.", "timestamp_created": 1626557863, "timestamp_updated": 1626557863, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95911879": {"recommendationid": "95911879", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967876062", "num_games_owned": 806, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 3883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3883, "last_played": 1612800173}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm over a decade late to Mass Effect, but it has been on my list for years.

It is a universe you can enjoyably get lost in, with an epic, surprising tale, tons of engaging sci-fi, warfare, & political drama, and a deeply, extensively well-realized sci-fi universe, where even the smallest historical & logistical nuances have been thoroughly considered & logged. There's complex science jargon abound, with nearly all of it properly rooted in realistic science or plausible science fiction. The game shines most with the many unique, gray moral dilemmas it presents you with, and the lasting, significant impact of many of your choices.\n\nHowever, consequences of many decisions are badly communicated (even important ones), there are many instances of false agency where your decisions don't make any difference whatsoever (even in what the character ends up saying), the game is very buggy and unpolished, and there are lots of extremely flawed, weak, and ill-considered gameplay systems and mechanics implemented. The gameplay as a whole is a very weak mishmash of disparate ideas & genres, none well implemented or thought out. In particular, the Mako, combat gameplay, and gunplay are horrendously, laughably, frustratingly bad.\n\nThe game has one of the worst loot systems I've ever seen implemented (only behind Darksiders 2), and its loot management UX is just as bad and terribly structured, with no thought given to the actual use cases for the UIs. The overall UI is pretty awfully constructed too, including some absurd key bindings. Voice acting ranges from decent to abysmal, though it mostly resides under acceptable. The soundtrack is inconsistent but epic, unique, and overall enjoyable, and gets particularly great in the latter missions. The main story missions are serious, dark, and troubling, and result in many drastic, lasting consequences. \n\nCredits and shops are useless, since good loot comes from loot containers and it is nigh impossible to compare all your equipment to what is in the stores for purchase. More than that, it is badly balanced - I maxed out the in-game credits to 999999999 before even reaching the last planet, completely acquired naturally within the game's loot system, no hacks or mods. I couldn't put those credits towards anything useful either. Even the weapons are completely imbalanced, with half of them being stupidly unusable and inaccessible for play with any given class, and their effectiveness doesn't scale right. Halfway into the game, I ended up with absolutely OP shotgun & pistol builds that completely & immediately decimated every enemy that confronted me, and it stayed that way up into the endgame. Battle encounters lost all tension, enjoyment, balance, and danger at that point.\n\nDespite all these flaws and so many other I didn't bother mentioning, it's still worth playing, because the world and story are so captivating, it is worth trudging through the terrible gameplay to experience them.\n\nMust be played with mods to be passable by today's gaming standards, at the very least for the necessary graphics overhaul & optimizations.", "timestamp_created": 1624178110, "timestamp_updated": 1624232353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94045289": {"recommendationid": "94045289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869127555", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1864, "last_played": 1631158085}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, I struggled to get into this my first playthrough.

In the extreme, I often felt like this was a walking and talking simulator. There is very little action and the fire fights are short. If you were expecting non-stop action like Quake 4, forget it. Also, there was an inordinate amount of configuration into the characters skills, weapons, etc for a game that actually has very little combat. I suggest putting most of your skills into the talking stats. Yes, there are stats that affect your talking. This is what I'm trying to say, people! I hear that all the effort you put into talking with the NPCs yields some cool story twists, but honestly, I'm half asleep before those kick in. So in summary, if you're used to these types of games, go for it. I'm sure you'll like it. But if you're like me and don't really enjoy the constant dialog, then you have a choice: 1) power through it to get to the good parts or 2) just buy DOOM instead.

Good story, interesting characters, fun side plots, and your choices actually matter. For me a 8/10. \n\n    \nFull Review: \n\n    Overall Mass Effect is a pretty solid game. The main plot is not exactly the most original, but it still kept me into the story. Your choices do matter here, at many points in the game main plot or side plot related, you will have important decisions to make. And at least for me it was quite obvious when I was in a \u201cimportant decision moment\u201d. Like most RPG\u2019s these decisions will ultimately impact how the galaxy sees you.\n    The Game mechanics were kinda weird for me to get used to in the beginning, whenever I'm aiming with a pistol or an assault rifle the crosshair jumps around. But way more than it normally would. And ADS with a sniper is very annoying. The aim does not stay still it just moves on its own. Sprint is only available when there are enemies around, it gets old cuse I just want to run around and get to places faster, when I'm not in combat. I didn't use in game weapon mods, I didn't see the necessity. Oh and the MAKO is so stupid fun to drive lol.\n    There are a few romance options, and if you are trying to avoid them you can but it's a little tricky. I wanted to romance the quarian Tali, but she's only available for romance in Mass Effect 2, so I didn't do any romance in this game. Fair warning the devs do try to throw a romance on you. \n    To wrap this up, there are some bugs in the game. You can install mods to fix it, but I was able to play through the whole game without needing mods. I do recommend this game especially if you want to port the save to the sequel. Solid 8/10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1619316104, "timestamp_updated": 1619316104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90871197": {"recommendationid": "90871197", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989229737", "num_games_owned": 736, "num_reviews": 286, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 488, "last_played": 1550976324}, "language": "english", "review": "Bull.", "timestamp_created": 1619314962, "timestamp_updated": 1619314962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90802772": {"recommendationid": "90802772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066230104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4554, "last_played": 1633879062}, "language": "english", "review": "great fun easy install", "timestamp_created": 1619214800, "timestamp_updated": 1619214800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90767999": {"recommendationid": "90767999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336158094", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1600390807}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved this game when it first came out. still really good", "timestamp_created": 1619166187, "timestamp_updated": 1619166187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90705703": {"recommendationid": "90705703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130434326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1613, "last_played": 1619050599}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Mass Effect but if you are ether not able to or dont want to put the effort in to get the game running dont buy it!

happily say that this is my favourite mass effect game, for one very specific reason: While it might look a bit dated and while its gameplay might no nearly be as polished as me2s (I still find the weapon cooldown system more interesting tho), the game has the best story out of all 3 games, as it not only establishes a rich world the other two did not really expand upon, but also tells a really good self enclosed sci-fi story with a few minor annoyances. But the real reason that makes this game stand out is that it perfectly blends a hopeful, bright future setting in which humanity has overcome most of its problems with really scary horror elements like gross body horror zombies and people being mind controlled by a blob or AI that will just mercilessly massacre you. The contrast really makes it stick and makes you care for these characters. Me2 and 3 chose to go for a darker, more edgy and gritty setting in general which makes their scary concepts like people being turned into people juice not nearly as shocking. I think that your first mission on Eden Prime perfectly demonstrates this idea when young and hopeful Jenkins gets killed off and a nice and bright colony gets murdered by some deep space horror.

I love how every planet has something that is written about it, giving a much more lived in feel to the world of Mass Effect, I'd say that is what this game does best. Environments are varied and fun to explore, though quite linear, the story will take you to all sorts of locations that will each be interesting and offer different bits of lore in turn.\nNow, that is all I have to say about what the game excells at, again, I have a love-hate relationship with this game, and the game continuously likes to make me hate it. Lets start from the top.\nGameplay for me is a bit wonky, it can be more fun to play specific classes in this game, more specifically the ones that use biotic abilities, but as for every other class, they can feel a bit lacking, and not only that the gunplay in this game is, to be frank, average. I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to make the weapons work in the way that they work in this game, somehow snipers are ironically the most inaccurate thing to shoot in the world, good luck hitting anything with it unless they are basically kissing you, shotguns are good if you can get close enough but in my experience, you never wanted to, and assault rifles were a bit weak, leaving pistols as really the only viable option, again, this is based on my experience.\nLevelling can be quite rewarding, though most of the time a lot of the levelling is just buffing abilities and your character, same with squad mates, it never became a problem but I didn't really find it special, it worked well and I guess that's all that matters. \nGameplay wise this game a lot of the times feels like your typical third-person shooter, though abilities are what make that system fun, experiment a lot with it I would say and you'd get the most out of it, I don't really have much to say about it, only that it really does feel like it needs some refining, the most I got to say are about the MAKO segments of this game, which let me just say...\nI have never hated a vehicle so much in a video game in my entire life.\nThe MAKO is clunky, floaty, and way too bouncy. I found myself pulling hairs whenever I use the damn thing, aiming and shooting I found to be a chore, and movement in general felt like you were driving a bouncy ball, which leads me to the one thing I found to be the worst part of this game.\nThe Exploration Missions.\nBefore that, let me just explain about the linear missions, these all take place in the main story and aren't that bad, they have an actual structure, feel very different from each other, and just work, the MAKO isn't even that bad in these missions.\nThe Exploration Missions are the worst.\nI will never understand why people praised this part of the game, the exploration mission are a bulk of the side quests in this game and they are mind numbingly boring and frustrating. If you ever wanted to play a game where every level is just the same randomly generated terrains with retextures then this game is for you. Every. Planet. Is. The. Same. I felt like I was going crazy by the end of it, if you are going to play this game, the do yourselves a favour and just do the recommended quests, these quests will have some sort of story significance or will make it so you meet characters in later games.\nGraphically, the game has aged, a lot of the textures are blurry and muddy, do yourselves a favour and install a few mods to improve those textures.\nFinally I will talk about the DLCs, Bring Down the Sky is a must for every player, it introduces a new species into the universe and has some significance to your character and their story. Gameplay wise, yeah, you remember what I said about those Exploration Missions? Yeah, it's those except longer and linear, with really the only interesting gameplay being the final fight. Pinnacle Station is the 2nd and last one for this game, it being a kind of arena based DLC, where you fight in a bunch of different arenas for challenges, this DLC brings great rewards but honestly, it's pretty damn tedious and dull, it's mostly the same gameplay loop.\nOverall, if I were to give this game any type of rating, it would probably be a 6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1617498297, "timestamp_updated": 1617498297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89649675": {"recommendationid": "89649675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050005710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1459960404}, "language": "english", "review": "Modern classic", "timestamp_created": 1617472075, "timestamp_updated": 1617472075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89628278": {"recommendationid": "89628278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057361131", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5073, "last_played": 1620818789}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 but wait for the remaster", "timestamp_created": 1617449993, "timestamp_updated": 1617449993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517150402069091797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89551078": {"recommendationid": "89551078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310390112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6592, "last_played": 1625016357}, "language": "english", "review": "great game !!", "timestamp_created": 1617354968, "timestamp_updated": 1617354968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89540861": {"recommendationid": "89540861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390623906", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1075, "last_played": 1594182978}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly janky in terms of combat, physics, and graphics.\nThe story, dialogue, and setting easily makes up for that and sets up a great trilogy.", "timestamp_created": 1617338427, "timestamp_updated": 1617338427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89476476": {"recommendationid": "89476476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072703542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 11325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10674, "last_played": 1656786804}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't give Mass Effect a second thought until 2019.

You play play a space Military Commander by the name of John/Jane Shepard. He takes charge of naval vessel with his crew on missions to Chase after a Antagonistic who want  the rule of Men and Aliens and destroy the Galaxy. The missions are in a third person recon style with a three man fire team. Here are some of my thoughts down below.\n\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are error free or low amounts of it Given consideration that it was made in 2007. having a game like this, was state of the art back then and they are are pretty good to look at. From the sexy Alien Asari to bury Krogen the graphics did a wonderful job in drawing a picture to  a world that is unusual.\n\nThe story with Dialog options: In this game Dialog options come in a variety of  limited choices. Tasteful and reasonable gives the game a comic book feel like the gamer is watching a cartoon with an fascinating story.\n\nGreat gaming physics: One of the amusing parts of the game is the land rover named MAKO. While on missions the MAKO is this Tanky buggy looking Vehicle that travels over any terrain. kind of fun to see it lunch off of a mountain.\n\nRich Story: The world is enveloped in politics, war and other aliens which gives the story more depth.\n\nCons:\n\nThe gaming A.I  is immature:  Part of the game play is to take two other companions on these mission that will assist the characters in battle. Some times the characters can not go around a wall and keep getting stuck there. Other time they will stand out in open and get shot and not take cover. In years development, this will improve in games.\n\nNo Controller option without Computer Science modifications. I am sure there is a way to code in the Xbox controller but for people who don't want to that it there is no option.\n\nReplay ability:\nThere are two status that may change the story line one is the Paragon option and the other is the Renegade. depending on dialog and options the stories are different so playing it again a get a alternative experience. \n\nOverall Fun 9/10 and this is must play if your interested in the mass effect Trillogy\n\n\n\n\n\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1617225358, "timestamp_updated": 1617225358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89450398": {"recommendationid": "89450398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060287234", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1126, "last_played": 1617215746}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid game, first I want to talk about the ai.

In the beginning it might seem a little complicated and unclear. But once you understood everything - it is incredible. It is interesting, deep and quite emotional. While playing you always want to know what will happen next. Overall, playing the game makes you want to learn more about Mass Effect world. \n  The gameplay also is great and unique. Besides amazing story missions, side quests are also really interesting. Dialogue system is great. Your desicions and answers can make a huge difference later on. RPG part is also great. There are lots of different weapons, armors, skills, upgrades and etc. Playing the game is simply interesting and, thanks to the gameplay, you just want to keep playing. The only problem is that it might take some time to understand all the gameplay mechanics. \n  Technical part is also nice. For 2007 graphics is incredible. And I personally didn't find any bugs or problems like that. \n [b] So for me \"Mass Effect\" was like a discovery in a gaming world. I would recommend this game to literally anyone, even if you don't like everything that is related to the cosmic theme.

Combat is uninteresting and tedious, and a lot of the side content is repetitive and boring. \n\nNote: DLCs must be downloaded externally.

decade I can say with confidence that it does live up to the hype. However this doesn't surprise me one bit considering the experience that BioWare has crafting these kinds of experiences. \n\nKOTOR and Dragon Age Origins being some of my favorite games I've played in the last 5 or so years I was pleased to see again that this style of choice based storytelling with heavy companion integration is still a winner if not a bit underwhelming. I'd be lying if I said the jump to full protagonist voice over didn't slightly neuter the dialog choices. While excellent they are still not near the level of those presented in KOTOR, in which you will always know what your character is going to say, as apposed to a 3 word summary you get to chose. It's not a huge complaint but I feel it hurts the role play aspect and immersion.\n\nIssues with the overall new-aged dialog interface aside the story is good. It was interesting to see a sci-fi universe that turns enough tropes on their heads to keep everything fresh and interesting. The illusion of choice is presented well and while a bit of a railroad track of an adventure it feels natural to play and experience. Add in a great cast of companions except for Kaid who I dislike because he is essentially just Carth from KOTOR and I didn't like his character there either.\n\nGame-play is rough and the first hours as your just leveling up can be difficult but once you get rolling through the upgrade tree the difficulty nearly disappears as you ascend to near god hood. While not technically wowing it is fun to blast through later combat encounters. Side missions are a bit lacking and you'll grow tired of exploring the same 3 copy paste buildings and fighting the same enemies on planets with varying levels of mountains and differing colors but their are some that are pretty unique and good experiences.\n\nWhile the planets you get to free explore may be overall lacking despite a few standouts with amazing sky boxes or interesting side missions there is one standout of exploration I must praise and that is the MAKO the way that vehicle controls and the absurdity of it climbing mountains like nothing as the physics freak out when it rolls make it one of my favorite vehicles in any game. Driving it is a joy, maybe not for developer intended reasons but fun is fun.\n\nOverall this game is a surprisingly straightforward BioWare experience levels are never longer than necessary and the story is fresh and interesting. I'm excited to play ME2 and potentially be disappointed by ME3.

I may just be messing up or setting up the controller wrong however it works fine on other games and games even as old as Fallout 3 that already has its own lists of issues. Even if you get the controller to work you miss out on a lot of dlc that steam cannot provide and EA stops the use of you being able to even add it to begin with. \n\nI recommend waiting for the legendary edition than purchase this game and end up in a complicated loop. Like said even if you get lucky enough to get pass the controller problem you already have problems accessing the dlc. (by all means if people found a way to get the controller to work or even better the dlcs Im willingly to give this more of a shot.)", "timestamp_created": 1614549882, "timestamp_updated": 1614549882, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87629438": {"recommendationid": "87629438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011073885", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1614541408}, "language": "english", "review": "avoid Steam version like the plague!

Combat is defintly at it's weakest here, you start off having a generally bad time trying to do anything ( imagine having to dump a punch of skill points to get rid of shepards sudden parkinson disease anytime you look in a sniper scope) to walking all over anything once you get your hand on some later gear/ having more perks (I'm talking any difficulty here, you start stomping over everything maybe a third of the way through). \nThe exploration in this game is barebones, you drive over barren fields of nothing and do a pretty weak minigame or clear out the same building type here and there...really not all that.\nGraphics...actually don't bother me/ holds up well given its age. of course if they do bother you there are mods out there to make them a bit better\nWhere this game still holds up tho is the story/world building department, I can still vividly recall the details of even the most minute side missions. They really do just stick with you like that (and virmire might still be one of my favorite missions of the whole series)\n\nIf you're new to mass effect as a whole I still recomend starting here but if you absolutly can't put up with the clunky combat you can get away with using the genisis comic of mass effect 2 to get the general overview/ make key choices. If you're a vet of the series and are just thinking about playing on pc I can't say this version has any benifits over the console, even worse if you planned on using controllers as thats not an

The quality of the storytelling is way below their previous games. Just take a look at the first act: the game starts with a huge exposition dump, then the bad guy gets identified by an unreliable witness (who disappears), and a bad quality audio recording (which could be a forgery). This prompts the council to promote Shepard to a position of more power and less accountability than Judge Dredd, to conduct a galaxy-wide witchhunt. [spoiler]And after this the council never believes anything Shepard says.[/spoiler] This madness continues throughout the entire game, but let's stop here for the sake of brevity.\n\nThe plot is not just a mess, it's also highly predictable, because [i]everything[/i] is a foreshadowing, and it's as subtle as a wrecking ball. Still, I liked that on every major plot world Shepard can exterminate an entire alien race.\n\nA lot of work went into the world building with all the alien races and galactic history, and the lore is indeed really good, consistent, and detailed. The problem is that most of that is discovered by reading the codex. You can't talk to navigator Pressly or Joker about space combat, you can't talk about alien physiology with doctor Chackwas, or talk about tech stuff with the engineering guy. The entire cast is underutilized. The companions each have one short mission, and they can only talk about one boring subject. The love interests have a bit more dialog, but Kaidan only talks about how bad the boarding school was, and Ashley only talks about how the aliens are untrustworthy. No wonder all players romance the blue alien girl instead of these two goons.\n\nThe thing that really grinds my gears is how the guest star, Lance Henriksen, is utilized. He voices admiral Hackett, who gives most of the exploration side-quests, but he's just a disembodied voice. He only appears on-screen in a ME2 DLC. Whyyy??\n\nFor a high sci-fi setting the part of the world you get to explore is surprisingly dull. When on foot you mostly go through huge empty areas with featureless bare concrete walls. When landing on a planet with the rover, it's almost always barren and empty and dull. On every planet the outpost is the exact same prefab building, even the crates are in the same place. The collectible trinkets are unrewarding. The side quests are disappointing and unrewarding. The loot is 99% garbage, and you have to spend a lot of time organizing that garbage, because the inventory capacity is limited.\n\nThe talent system is overcomplicated and underdeveloped. Can anyone tell the difference among the 4 biotic talents without checking the wiki? How about the 4 engineering talents? Can you tell me which talent allows hacking doors and containers? Hint: it's not Hacking. Weapon talents are kinda important, because this game tries to be a cover-shooter, but it's unbalanced, because almost all classes are restricted to 1-2 weapon types. Yet, everybody carries one of each weapon type, even the ones they can't use.\n\nThe game has little replay value, but it wants you to replay it multiple times to unlock class skills and companion bonuses. No thanks.\n\nThe morality system is also a disaster. You need Paragon/Renegade points to upgrade the Charm/Intimidate talents and unlock the respective dialog options. Then you need to use those dialog options to gain Paragon/Renegade points. This vicious circle turns role-playing into XP-farming, because you'll need high talent levels and/or Paragon/Renegade points to convince key characters. You can totally miss this this whole system in the early game, because you don't even see the charm/intimidate dialog options until you put points into those talents, which the automatic level-up doesn't do. [spoiler]Fortunately, there is an infinite Paragon/Renegade exploit on Noveria.[/spoiler] How could the creators of several legendary RPG titles screw this up so badly?\n\nWhat is this morality scale supposed to be anyway? Good and evil? Lawful and chaotic? Pacifist and bloodthirsty? Idealistic and pragmatic? Dumb and dumber?\n\nThe biggest fail of of the morality system is at the ending. If you have high points, you can convince the boss to abandon his plans, but this only skips the first phase of the fight, and you still have to endure the fkin annoying second phase, so the morality farming was useless. Also, why does killing the bad guy cause his spaceship to explode as well? And why is saving the council so important? The aliens could easily delegate new members (especially the Salarians), and if they were so irreplaceable then why were they allowed to board the same ship? Ehh, I don't want to argue anymore.\n\nDid I sink more than 60 hours into this? Yes. Was it worth it?

The gunplay is clunky af and the AI isn't very intelligent, which doesn't make the combat very enjoyable.\n\nBut stick through it and you are rewarded with  one of the finest and most epic stories and characters in video game history.", "timestamp_created": 1611502563, "timestamp_updated": 1611502563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85273440": {"recommendationid": "85273440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135673691", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2061, "last_played": 1607899483}, "language": "english", "review": "After all these years it's hard to believe that this epic journey started with a Powell sleeping on the job.", "timestamp_created": 1611502284, "timestamp_updated": 1611502284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85253603": {"recommendationid": "85253603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157683410", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 949, "last_played": 1612748171}, "language": "english", "review": "Great", "timestamp_created": 1611476551, "timestamp_updated": 1611476551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85250523": {"recommendationid": "85250523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214862568", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1604, "last_played": 1633139667}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Mr. C.

I originally had this on my old 360, and when I saw it was on sale on Steam, I just had to get it. One of the best purchases I have made on here, its such a brilliant game, one of my favourites ever, and probably my favourite in the trilogy. \n\nThe universe is so huge, detailed and beautiful. Honestly, this is probably one the best original universes in fiction, not just gaming. It really feels alive and that you are part of it, shaping it. The writing and pacing of the story is done so well that you naturally understand more of the galaxy as you progress. The music is also amazing, one of the best in gaming history, and it drips with atmosphere ('Vigil' is an absolute classic tune, and probably the best piece in the Mass Effect series soundtrack). The cinematic cutscenes are also surprisingly polished for how old the game is. Overall, the presentation, story and universe makes this an absolute classic and must-play.\n\nSure, the combat and the AI are very clunky and admittedly very dated, and the morality system is a bit questionable in places, but the story and universe does more than make Mass Effect a worthwhile play, they make it a fantastic one. This is also the game with the best RPG elements in the series, featuring a really in-depth powers system based on your class, and you get the most freedom to make Shepard who you want them to be out of all the games. The amount of powers your squad gets is also a huge bonus, making it an essential tactic to command them wisely on higher difficulties, and really be wise with their upgrades when you level up. I still love Mass Effect 2 and 3, but I do still wish they kept these elements in the later games.\n\nOverall, an absolute classic and still well worth it despite its age.

I also really felt that my choices mattered, and while the binary Paragon/Renegade (good/evil) skill system is a little limited, it still works better than most choice-based RPG's I've played. I also love that the world is really internally consistent, with everything about its technology and politics making sense with each other.\n\nThe graphics and game mechanics may have been impressive for 2007, but playing it now they are pretty painfully clunky. While there are quite a lot of combat playstyles (guns/tech/biotic), the gameplay never really felt that fun. Still, it's definitely worth it to get through it and experience the excellent story.\n\nOverall, this was a great game made me feel confident in my decisions - my story path and my Shepard are \"canon\" to me now. Unlike other games where I tend to want to explore every possible branch and outcome, here I'd rather miss out on some content and keep my \"illusion of choice\", so to speak.

What you need to know, this game is not linear. You got choices to do and you got other stories to explore. It's well written in my opinion, however there are few low points or unexplained actions, which not really makes sense for me. In general, the conversations also well written, however you can get some lines here or there. I won't explain the story, but you can get lot of details, which is why this game is so awesome. Well made, really!\n\nIf the story is epic, then what can I tell about the music? Makes it better. All of the music is really fit, what you see. Either if it's a dramatic moment or you are trying to survive, the game always give you the proper track. Top notch job!\n\nTime to mention the gameplay. So, this is a Third Person Shooter with some tactical elements, not even mentioning the RPG elements. There is 2 part of the game. 1 part when you explore places, talking characters and doing your business, even traveling in space. You can talk most of the characters, and at big portion of them you do different path of conversations, which is awesome. Exploring places and doing your business is not really interesting for some, but the game is well detailed even here too. Sometimes, you need to perform choices, and those have some effect too, even if it's instant, but sometimes it will happen later, even if in later games. For example, one time I gave some information to a report, and when I was in an elevator, a news broadcast said, the report has succesfully used this information and caught a criminal syndicate. I mention traveling in space, which is came later in the game. You can choose in which system you want to go and what universe. If you there, you can find planets which you can check some info of them, some of them are able to survey, which searching it through and you can find collectibles, which give you money or even land on them. Long story short, this portion of the game is big, can be boring, but has lot of story in it in general and makes the game interesting to play with, and not just fighting all the time.\n\nThe second part of the gameplay, is the fighting. So in fights, you will can use 4 weapons, which are pistols, assault rifles, shotguns and sniper rifle. However what I didn't mention, depending what character you have, you are perform these weapons differently. At the beginning of the game you can create your character background, which gives you lot of status points on different things. This can change the gameplay well, also you can customize your character too. Going back to the fight element, you can use skill too, which can came from implants, or your omni tool, but even soldier powers. Every kind of skills as advantages, and you can also level it up on is status page, if you get enough XP. Need to mention the crew mates too, because you won't be alone most of the times. You can give order to your crew mates, and in figths, you usually have 2 next to you. They are also different characters, with different powers and and loadout, which you can manage too. Not even mentioning, your own loadout. Usually in fights, you need to control your teammates and use their skill if they are not using it, meanwhile you also trying to move cover-to-cover and do your part. These one can be exciting to play, however I wouldn't say it's hard. I played the game on Veteran combat difficutly, and it didn't had to much action... except two missions. The combat can feel weird, and has some issues, one of the is the strict controls and sometimes not activable skills, which annoeyed me the most. These parts are all right by the way, not even mentioning the different enemies and behaviours too. Need to mention the Mako, which is a vehicle you can use to explore planets. The Mako can fly a little, shoot with machine gun or burst fire with it. It's a cool vehicle and fightining with it is also good, however the controls is something you need to get use to. Long story short, the gameplay is varied and interesting, you need tactics if the situation is bad, but you can win with brute force too sometimes. You get lot of options to deal with the enemies, and also the Mako is an all right vehicle, but the controls in both parts can be troublesome for others.\n\nOne more thing I need to mention at the gameplay, and those are the side missions. Sadly, this is where the game is weak at, because even though there are some interesting side missions with okay story, there are lot of copy paste one. What I mean, for example your objective is to destory a group of pirates, and you get a planet with a pirate complex on it. You go inside the building, do your fight and take another. Destroy generators in a complex. If you go into the building, you might get the same layout building like last time, which is break the illusion. Okay, the room looks different, because stuff inside is different, but this can be noticable really fast. I notice 4 different building layout and I did like around 20 missions. It's kinda annoying to see this, comapring to the wide story elements. And also, there are 2 DLCs for the game, but actually only the meteorite one worth the time. It starts like a normal side mission, but atleast it has some depth and you can get really good items from it. So sadly this is not that good part.\n\nLast part is the graphics. Made in 2008, and time wasn't that nice to it. I won't say it looks bad, because it's not the case, however there are textures, which looks pixelated. Not even mentioning, sometimes the light effects are too much. There is one big problem with the game, which happens on AMD processors. Some processor can cause the game at two planets to make every character a black pixelated box. This still not fixed by BioWare, but thankfully there is better version. If you experience these, turn on the console for the game, which you can do in the game's Steam folder -> BioGame -> Config -> DefaultInput.ini . If you there, find a line which is [Engine.Console] . Under it, there are two more lines. Under them, write the following: ConsoleKey=p . With this, you will be able to bring up the console with 'P'. In game if you see the problem, you press 'P' and write: viewmode unlit . With this, the lighthing will be weird, but the characters will look normally. If you want to change it back, write lit instead of unlit in the previous line or restart the game. So, the graphics are not bad for now, but back in the days, it was amazing!\n\nFor me, the first Mass Effect is a really good game and start of a amazing series. I really do like almost every aspect of this game and the details too.

In addition to how long I've played it on Steam (4 playthoughs atm) I've also played it maybe a dozen times on PS3. The universe established in this game is nothing short of brilliant and I absolutely love every character, every piece of lore, and every main mission. Saren is one of the best antagonists I think in any sci-fi media period, especially if you read the prequel novel Revelation, and all the voice actors give incredible performances. Though I tend to stick as FemShep both Jennifer Hale and Mark Meer are excellent and bring the character of Commander Shepard to life in a way that really wasn't heard of back when it came out 14 years ago. I love the planetary exploration aspect of this game as well, the cheap vibe of the side quests has a unique charm to it akin to games like The Witcher 1 as well as honestly fitting it more with a modern take on classic Star Trek. Combat is pretty wonky yes but as long as you're not trying the Pinnacle Station DLC (which I would honestly never recommend to anyone) it's fine and pretty easy. Inventory management is a big pain but that's true in many other RPGs as well so it's not a huge drawback imo.

One of the best stories I have ever experienced in a game and one of the most heroic characters I have had the chance to play.  \n\nThis is the first in a trilogy series.

Ese no fue impedimento para que se convierta una uno de los mejores videojuegos que haya probado jam\u00e1s. Realmente me dejo con muchas ganas de jugar las otras entregas, y al fin lo he hecho con la primera.\n\nPero veamos de que va el juego (si es que por alguna raz\u00f3n no lo sabes ya). En Mass Effect nos ponemos en la piel del Comandante Shepard (aclarar que podemos cambiar el genero de nuestro protagonista, adem\u00e1s de otras cosas), un soldado elite de la Alianza de Sistemas (representaci\u00f3n humana frente a otras especies) que se ver\u00e1 envuelto en un problema mucho m\u00e1s grande que \u00e9l. A lo largo de las horas iremos descubriendo la \u00e9pica trama de este t\u00edtulo, en donde como es de esperar, deberemos de salvar a toda la galaxia de una feroz amenaza milenaria. El juego cuenta con uno de los mejores universos ficticios que he visto. Especies alien\u00edgenas, planetas, historias de trasfondo, personajes memorables, eventos, etc., un contexto y trasfondo muy bien cuidados. Realmente te hace querer saber cada vez m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s, adentrarte en este fant\u00e1stico mundo para poder as\u00ed disfrutar de la trama de la mejor manera posible.\n\nComo era de esperar viniendo de BioWare, en este t\u00edtulo tenemos ciertas libertades a la hora de tomar decisiones, libertades que afectaran el desarrollo de la historia con diversas consecuencias, menores o mayores. Adem\u00e1s, podremos interactuar y desarrollar distintas relaciones con cada uno de los miembros de nuestra tripulaci\u00f3n, cada uno de ellos con una historia propia muy interesante. A trav\u00e9s de nuestro actuar modificaremos el como nos perciben los dem\u00e1s, siendo de esta forma un h\u00e9roe totalmente correcto, o algo m\u00e1s rebelde. Y debo aclarar que como todo juego de rol, aqu\u00ed tambi\u00e9n tendremos un \u00e1rbol de habilidades que podremos mejorar mediante puntos de experiencia.\n\nTen\u00eda algo de temor con este t\u00edtulo, Yo, como mencion\u00e9 antes, he jugado Mass Effect 2 previo a este, y siendo ese un t\u00edtulo que me ha encantado, pero en el cual se notaba mucho el pasar de los a\u00f1os, tem\u00eda encontrarme ac\u00e1 con algo peor que arruinara mucho mi experiencia de juego. Por suerte no ha sido as\u00ed, al menos no mucho. Evidentemente se nota el pasar del tiempo, aunque llega un punto en donde la inmersi\u00f3n es tal que no te das cuenta de ello. Cosas como el no contar con resoluci\u00f3n 1080p, las toscas mec\u00e1nicas de combate, las anticuadas f\u00edsicas de movimiento, las limitaciones t\u00e9cnicas de la \u00e9poca, todas ellas son cosas que afectan el gameplay, y se nota. Por otro lado, por momentos el juego se vuelve repetitivo, especialmente en las misiones secundarias (con las principales no sucede esto). Literalmente nos encontraremos con niveles iguales a otros anteriores, entornos copiados y reutilizados, enemigos esparcidos de la misma forma, y dem\u00e1s cosas por el estilo. Esto es entendible cuando tenemos en consideraci\u00f3n que ya han pasado 13 a\u00f1os desde la salida del t\u00edtulo. Puede ser algo tedioso y un punto a criticar, pero las ganas de descubrir pueden m\u00e1s.\n\nLa sensaci\u00f3n que ten\u00eda cada vez que vagaba por los distintos planetas de la V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea, dialogando con los NPC de turno, descubriendo nuevas historias y dem\u00e1s, es fant\u00e1stica, verdaderamente est\u00e1 muy bien lograda. La m\u00fasica del t\u00edtulo as\u00ed como las voces y las cinem\u00e1ticas son estupendas, realmente se nota que quisieron hacer de Mass Effect algo muy bueno, que marcara un antes y un despu\u00e9s. Los gr\u00e1ficos del t\u00edtulo, si bien anticuados, no dejan de ser bellos, especialmente en las mencionadas cinem\u00e1ticas o cuando nos encontramos en planetas con paisajes muy hermosos. El desarrollo de la trama y su \u00e9pica conclusi\u00f3n son sin duda lo mejor del t\u00edtulo. Como digo, el universo de este t\u00edtulo es algo fant\u00e1stico, digno de admirar.\n\nMass Effect es una de las mejores sagas que conozco, no solo dentro del mundo de los videojuegos sino m\u00e1s all\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n. Si no les has dado a\u00fan una oportunidad, desde aqu\u00ed te animo a hacerlo, no te vas a arrepentir. De hecho est\u00e1s de suerte, dentro de poco se lanzar\u00e1 la trilog\u00eda remasterizada y puede que sea la mejor oportunidad para adentrarse en ella. Yo, por mi parte, jugar\u00e9 la tercera entrega as\u00ed como Andr\u00f3meda tambi\u00e9n, a pesar de las cr\u00edticas le tengo muchas ganas. Y luego claro, a esperar el pr\u00f3ximo t\u00edtulo de esta \u00e9pica franquicia ya anunciado. \u00a1Cuantas ganas y cuanto futuro!", "timestamp_created": 1610371133, "timestamp_updated": 1610371133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84488619": {"recommendationid": "84488619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090637851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 7093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4025, "last_played": 1611220906}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved Mass Effect from the first time i played.

The main story quests were all great and fleshed out and the storyline was fun and the dialogue was great especially when sheppard's dialogue choice isn't always as expected.\n\nOnce learning, upon doing research, that shotguns are the best until late game and work at a huge distance, combat encounters improved a ton. But for real...why have assault rifles with 0 accuracy. Suffers from overfilled inventory and not having all your skills until late in the game so you barely get to have fun with them. \n\nAlso the beginning of the game had a character creator, I wanted to play sheppard so I did not touch it, turns out that it was actually just choosing gender, backstory, and class.\n\nFor a new player I recommend creating a character, using shotguns initially, trying to control the AI's skills but don't worry about the buggy movement, focusing on the main story and some side quests, but don't waste your time exploring the empty planets, also maybe mod the game to have unlimited inventory.

The only mass effect game that i can call great. After playing the mass effect trilogy including andromeda,this game is my favourite one among all. This game had best concept/ideas and imo best gameplay too. The lore is also very deep on this game compared to any other mass effect game. Imo this the only mass effect game that actually did sci-fi game concept right.\nBe aware the review might contain spoilers.\nGAMEPLAY:\n------------\nMass effect is a light rpg with tactial action shooter elements. Lets start with the first thing a player is allowed to give their input to on the game, the dialogues. The Dialogue system in this game is done very well. I would say its the best among all mass effect games. This game has the least amount of auto dialogues compared to other games. Dialogue choices are also done perfectly. I actually felt like i was making choices that shaped the galaxy. Yes it is true not all the choices affects the end but you can see the impact of your choices on characters. And yes some choices are straight up illusion of choice which all mass effect games have,but this one had the strongest of all. You actually had the ability to say whatever you wanted even if it might not have affected the plot. You were given the freedom to shape your character however you want,the feeling which other games failed to make me feel like. There is also charm and intimidation on player stats which directly affects on what you can say on dialogues. Charm for more charamastic dialogues aka paragon and intimidation for rough n tough dialogues aka renegade. This added the sense of tacticallity and player freedom even on what the character can say. Again something other games totally axed. You also get to choose your characters backstory and origin. And the world reacts accordingly and dialogues are also played out according to what origin and backstory you choose. Player freedom in this game is amazing.\nNow lets talk about combat. Combat can be dived into two sections: solo combat and squad combat. Both are equally detailed.\n Solo combat in this game is very engaging and actually requires you to use the abilities given to you thoughtfully. Unlike other games where all you do is mindlessly shoot things. The Combat is very tactical which seperates itself from just a cover shooter. Ai in combat is also very smart. You can't just stay in cover and be safe,if you stay in cover for too long enemies actually come and attack you from front. This forces you to actually plan your combat strategy rather then just shooting whatever you see. The indepth player stats also add to that layer of tacticality,you can't just get most expensive armour and call it a day. You actually have to upgrade your amour stats in order to have proper defensive play. I also personally liked the overheat feature which most people seem to hate. I think the overheat feature actually forced player to take it slow and not fire mindlessly,again added more tacticallity to the game,made it trial and error which i personally enjoyed.\nSquad combat is also best in this game. Its the one that gives most control to the player instead of holding your hand and taking away most control like other games. You can give commands such as move,hold postion,attack,rally and also mix those commands to direct squad mates however you like. Another thing which next titles failed to achieve. You can also customise your squad mates armour and even squad mates have indepth stats system. Which allows player to decide what kind of playstyle squad mate goes with. The amount of player freedom this game has is mental and its honestly one of my favourite thing about this game.\nNow lets talk about exploration+side content,mission/level design.\nExploration in this game is something that is heavily criticized,but personally i thought it was fine and i actually enjoyed it for most cases. Yes it did have its flaws and starts to feel bit repetitive after a while but i enjoyed the sense of galaxy exploration it gave. And all planets actually have purpose to exist for side content or collectables,it wasn't clusterf*ck like andromeda. Side content is what makes those planets even more interesting to explore,most side content actually has interesting story/lore behind them. Except few where all you do is shoot things mostly n7 ones that are bad. Its not flawless but i didn't find it bad either. One thing to keep in mind exploration was never forced on player and also never interfered with main missions it was always there as an option.Shame sequels never managed to make exploration reach its full potential\nMission design is where mass effect is at its peak. Every single area of a mission actually have purpose to exist and missions are also not boring/linear at the same time. It's open ended while also not losing any focus or quality. Missions can end in different ways,different outcomes use diffeeent areas of the missions. World and characters even reacts on which order you did the main missions in. For example i went to the attacked colony feros at last so they were pissed i was late,liara gets pissed if you go to rescue her at last. This acknowledgement of player's action from world is fantastic and i loved it.\nNow i will go over few more minor things i liked. Inventory system was good except the annoying loot system menu,variety of weapon mods/accessories,player customization and squad customization was also good.\nOverall i loved mass effect's gameplay because of how open ended it is without losing focus and also because of how much player freedom it gives.\nStory:\n------\nLore of mass effect is one of the most detailed lore i have ever seen. The amount of backstories it has just for the sake of world building is mind blowing. This is the only mass effect that actually does the sci-fi/space opera fiction right. The World is believable,mysterious,unpredictable and also familiar all at the same time. There are also sub plots going on in the world such as genophage,quarian and geth conflict all this just to make player feel part of the world. And it does it so well.\nPlot starts out simple with our hero shepard going to an attacked colony then finding out about rogue spectre. Then becoming first human spectre himself. Then it gets complicated when its revealed main villain is an ancient ai civilization called repears. The ending to this game is also very satisfying\nOverall story and world of mass effect is something i adore now because of how detailed it is.\nCONCLUSION:\n--------------\nOverall mass effect is a great game with its indepth rpg elements,tactical action shooter gameplay and absolute player freedom over things compared to other ones in the series. Story and lore is also something that is very detailed to a point it actually makes you feel like you are part of the world. All those things combined imo makes it the best mass effect game.", "timestamp_created": 1609864791, "timestamp_updated": 1610045633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84073289": {"recommendationid": "84073289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092754465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5464, "last_played": 1611527180}, "language": "english", "review": "i mean it's mass effect, what more do you want", "timestamp_created": 1609857038, "timestamp_updated": 1609857038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84033455": {"recommendationid": "84033455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972556725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 101, "last_played": 1326096000}, "language": "english", "review": "Shepard.\nWrex.\nShepard.\nWrex.\n\"I gotta go\"", "timestamp_created": 1609808687, "timestamp_updated": 1609808687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692344486713409424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84031251": {"recommendationid": "84031251", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980734862", "num_games_owned": 1818, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 5300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2867, "last_played": 1610425044}, "language": "english", "review": "Mass Effect is a classic.

There are many other alien species in the galaxy and activating that portal did not please many. Ironically, we are the galaxy's best hope in preventing a plot that will wipe out all live in the entire galaxy.\n\n[H1]The good[/H1]\nFor a game that is now 14 years old it still holds pretty well for the storytelling. Having completed ME1 in 2020 felt like reading an interactive book, with intricate world building and character development. It is not like many Bethesda games where lore is just dumped in many books spread around the world and after the 10th book you think: \"yes whatever\". Instead, the lore is woven through all interactions and is carefully balanced. You always long for more, instead of getting bored with it.\n\nI played mostly the good guy (called Paragon in ME1) and most choices seem to make sense. Like many of the older Bioware games there are multiple ways to finding and solving quests and it is this part that make this a really good game. I enjoyed the voice acting of my companions and they grew on me as I progressed. Be aware that you will play this game mainly for the dialogues so it is text heavy; at any time you can skip it but you will miss out the best of the game.\n \n[H1]The not so good[/H1]\nThe game is from 2007 and unless you really would like to relive that time in terms of graphics and videos, I would strongly recommend to use at least a few mods to make the game feel and play a lot better. Find the hard work of fans at [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/] Nexus Mods [/url]. Still you will notice many decisions in level design that probably had to be put in place to make it run on 2007 machines: like the endless amount of elevators, 90 degree corners and walls covering up half of a level but that's ok: back in 2007 even with this I couldn't play it well as my PC was just too slow.\n\nThe inventory system is atrocious: even though it's an old game something like Diablo 1 or 2 had a better visual system where the items made a lot of sense. Just using a text-based system is very 1995.\n\nThe sound effects and music aren't so great - it's just serviceable and some of the songs are quite depressing.\n\nThe combat is just plain horrible: I played as an infiltrator/ commando but many times I had to fall back on my gun as that was the easiest way to dispose of the enemies. In general, the tactics of the brain-dead AI is just to swarm you: this got me killed a lot the first two times and then I realized the weakness and found a way to beat them without much trouble. Unfortunately, it is the same of my companions: while I love the interaction, they are just fodder in combat: merely there to distract while not being effective at all for most of the times. I couldn't help comparing it to a game like XCOM and it may have been a better solution to not make battles real-time but instead turn based so the player would not suffer so much of the bad AI.\n\nThe side quests in general felt poorly developed and pale in comparison to the main story. I did a few but they all felt like: \"go to this system, land on this generic planet where we just changed the colour scheme and enter one of the two or three generic bases and kill everything or find an item\". Finishing them was also not rewarding at all (you just get a text screen), except for one where you were able to get a specialized character class (but then again this did not make sense to me at all). \n\nThe graphics settings are a bit strange: I thought I could only play up to 1280x1024 but then on closer inspection there are arrows that bring up all HD resolutions as well. \n\nI disliked the MAKO (your vehicle) for its horrible physics and that together with the poor level design on generic planets where you literally have to drive over mountains made it not a good experience.\n\n[H1]Summary[/H1]\nYou can see that I name quite a few things that aren't that good. Does the good outweigh all of that? Well, yes it does. If you enjoy good story telling then this is still a game to get 14 or 15 years later. There will be a remaster coming out in 2021 but you don't have to wait for that IMHO. With the help of dedicated fans, the game still looks very good and despite its flaws the story is what kept me going. The layers of the world, the large amount of alien races and the mystery slowly reveals themselves to you. And this is actually interesting: I stopped playing AC Odyssey as I was bored and the story was not able to keep my attention - in the end you have this beautiful world that feels empty. With ME it is the opposite: yes, there are many flaws and the game is old but the story is what keeps it alive and fresh. I can understand now why people return to this game or finish it multiple times. \n\nIt's a classic game and most likely one of the last true Bioware gems before it all went south (which is such a shame as I used to be a huge fan ever since BG1). Just for that reason alone anyone with an interest in sci-fi action/RPG should play this game at least once. I got the game in 2008 but I was not able to play it on my computer back then. I then lost the copy and it was not until now (2020/2021) that I finally manage to play it. I enjoyed the game and I'm looking forward in playing the other ME games after this one.", "timestamp_created": 1609455001, "timestamp_updated": 1609455001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83667498": {"recommendationid": "83667498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055332988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3016, "last_played": 1609434588}, "language": "english", "review": "Great storyline, interesting character development and the graphics hold well up to this day (not as good as the graphics from present games, but even so it holds well enough). I'm sure the remastered edition will improve, at least, in the last aspect. So, if you're the kind of person who wants to play with higher graph specs, just wait a little. It's coming up in 2021.\n\nThe only thing I didn't enjoy as much is the exploration with the Mako. It becomes almost an obligation to explore the planets to complete side-quests like picking up minerals, metals, etc. I'm not against it, but it forces you to explore every planet instead of being a nice option for whoever likes exploration. Besides, if you don't go exploring and don't do the side-quests, it can be harder to get a good-enough level for the main missions. Half the exploration for me was already too much. \nThe exploration part per se is not that bad. When I played ME Andromeda, exploration was longer, for example, but it was also nice from time to time (specially considering the views). However, for me it was the same as it has been with ME1, I would've liked less exploration and grinding side-quests. I'd rather talk to someone and find their lost relative who will later be helping out in some other place. Go into their story a bit rather than go looking for any plant/mineral/whatever that has no special purpose apart from completing a collection that has no use or implication later on at any level. Getting a badge for completing this kind of missions doesn't feel good enough for me if there's no effect at all in the game story, character interactions or object/building changes. Not that I don't like hearing the \"news\" while in the elevator, but I also like more visible implications.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather focus on the story, character development and seeing the consequences of your own choices. That's what I liked the most about this game. Your actions have implications in the world around you and you can see those along the game. That part was awesome! But that's just personal taste. \n\nOverall, the game is great up to this day and I highly recommend it.

This is pure sci-fi bliss. So much love and care went into crafting the futuristic world. Exploring the citadel, I moved between locales that evoked the best of 80's space cinema, into areas that represented what my imagination might conjure in the heat of a laser tag battle and then on into locations that felt like a matured version of Disney's Tomorrowland. Sometimes they felt like all three at once! Such detail! I could touch the concrete overpass, feel the wind drifting by in the starry night, tousling my hair, see myself awash in neon lights. I wasn't playing a game. I was really there!!\n\nThe mood is enhanced by a masterfully crafted score. Synth tones and digital percussion blend to inject you with the suspense, mystery and wonder that would await you in a romanticized future.\n\nThe world building is easily one of the best of any game I have ever experienced.\n\nStory is deep and engaging. Combat can be a little clunky on PC due to the controls and lack of console controller support options, but the progression system is deeply rewarding. The player agency provided by dialog and behavior choices is really special. This is one of the few games I have played that offer dialog response choices that feel natural, rather than forced.\n\nOverall an amazing game, and one that was released way ahead of it's time.

After examining and deciphering the prosthetic artifacts, humans were finally able to develop space propulsion systems faster than light and also discovered the mass portals that allow them to travel quickly to other planetary systems. Shortly afterwards, numerous human colonies were established within the Milky Way.\n\nIn 2157 humans first encountered an intelligent alien species, the turians. The so-called First Contact War broke out, but it ended shortly afterwards on the intervention of the Citadel Council. The Citadel is a space station in the Serpent Nebula that serves as the seat of an intergalactic world government. The most influential species, asari, turians and salarians, are represented with their own councilors in the Citadel Council, less influential species usually try to protect their interests through a message on the Citadel. Humanity then also sends its own ambassador and tries to integrate itself peacefully into intergalactic society. But since the people belong to the most rapidly expanding and aspiring peoples of the Citadel, the turians in particular encounter them with a certain distrust.\n\nAn unknown Prothean artifact was found on the human colony of Eden Prime in 2183. The player character Commander Shepard, who can be male or female, is a soldier on a secret mission of the Citadel Council on board a frigate prototype called \"SSV Normandy\", a spaceship of the human alliance, to recover the artifact. In addition to the recovery, the mission also serves the purpose of examining Shepard as a possible candidate for the Citadel special forces of the Specters (Special Tactics and Reconnaissance). Members of this unit are elite soldiers whose job it is to maintain peace and stability in the galaxy. They have special powers and a high reputation, only they have to justify themselves before the Citadel Council, from which they can also receive orders. The alliance hopes to gain significance among the Citadel peoples by accepting a person in the special unit for the first time.\n\nUpon arrival of the Normandy, however, Eden Prime is attacked by the geth led by the turian and longtime Specters Saren, who is trying to get the artifact into his possession. The geth are a cybernetic race created as servants by the quarians who turned against their creators and exiled them. Shepard and his unit can prevent them from stealing the artifact, but it destroys itself when Shepard comes too close to him. Visions burn into his consciousness that herald the destruction of planets and all of the inhabitants living on them. As the game progresses, these turn out to be a warning to the Protheans against the attacks of a technically advanced race known only as \"the Reaper\".\n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ believable SciFi universe\n+ incredibly large game world\n+ good tactical combat system\n+ great weapon & biotic effects\n+ very atmospheric soundtrack\n+ Decisions with consequences\n+ Replay value thanks to high level limit (60) and alternative ways of playing (exemplary / unscrupulous)\n+ very good creature design of the opponents\n\n[h1] Contra [/h1]\n\n- Too little life in the city and contacts in the two bars\n- Minimap immediately shows all target areas on planets\n- Vehicle cannot be upgraded\n- Party members cannot be positioned individually in a fight and behave stupidly\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nMass Effect offers you a ScFi adventure that you will never forget, it is c\n\n\n[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]\n\nMass Effect ist ein klassisches Rollenspiel, welches von Bioware entwickelt wurde. \n\n[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]\n\nDie Handlung beginnt im Jahr 2183. 35 Jahre zuvor hatte die Menschheit auf dem Mars Artefakte und Ruinen der Protheaner, einer offenbar ausgestorbenen, aber technologisch extrem weit fortgeschrittenen Zivilisation, entdeckt. Nach der Untersuchung und Entschl\u00fcsselung der protheanischen Artefakte konnten die Menschen schlie\u00dflich Raumfahrtantriebe mit \u00dcberlichtgeschwindigkeit entwickeln und entdeckten auch die Massenportale, mit denen sie schnell in andere Planetensysteme reisen k\u00f6nnen. Kurz darauf wurden zahlreiche menschliche Kolonien innerhalb der Milchstra\u00dfe errichtet.\n\nIm Jahr 2157 trafen Menschen erstmals auf eine intelligente au\u00dferirdische Spezies, die Turianer. Es kam zum sogenannten Erstkontaktkrieg, der jedoch kurz darauf auf Intervention des Citadel-Rats beendet wird. Die Citadel ist eine Raumstation im Serpent-Nebel, die als Sitz einer intergalaktischen Weltregierung dient. Die einflussreichsten Spezies, Asari, Turianer und Salarianer, sind mit einem eigenen Ratsherren im Citadel-Rat vertreten, weniger einflussreiche Spezies versuchen in der Regel ihre Interessen durch eine Botschaft auf der Citadel wahren zu lassen. Die Menschheit entsendet daraufhin ebenfalls einen eigenen Botschafter und versucht sich in die intergalaktische Gesellschaft friedlich zu integrieren. Da die Menschen aber zu den am st\u00e4rksten expandierenden und aufstrebendsten V\u00f6lkern der Citadel geh\u00f6ren, begegnen ihnen insbesondere die Turianer mit einem gewissen Misstrauen. \n\nAuf der menschlichen Kolonie Eden Prime wird im Jahr 2183 ein unbekanntes Artefakt der Protheaner gefunden. Der Spielercharakter Commander Shepard, der wahlweise m\u00e4nnlich oder weiblich sein kann, befindet sich als Soldat in geheimer Mission des Citadel-Rates an Bord eines Fregattenprototyps genannt \u201eSSV Normandy\u201c, ein Raumschiff der menschlichen Allianz, um das Artefakt zu bergen. Die Mission dient neben der Bergung auch dem Ziel, Shepard als m\u00f6glichen Kandidaten f\u00fcr die Citadel-Spezialeinheit der Spectres (Special Tactics and Reconnaissance) zu pr\u00fcfen. Mitglieder dieser Einheit sind Elitesoldaten, deren Aufgabe darin besteht, Frieden und Stabilit\u00e4t in der Galaxie zu wahren. Sie verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber besondere Vollmachten und ein hohes Ansehen, einzig vor dem Citadel-Rat m\u00fcssen sie sich rechtfertigen, von dem sie ebenfalls Auftr\u00e4ge erhalten k\u00f6nnen. Durch die erstmalige Aufnahme eines Menschen in die Spezialeinheit erhofft sich die Allianz einen Bedeutungszuwachs unter den Citadel-V\u00f6lkern.\n\nBei Ankunft der Normandy wird Eden Prime jedoch von den Geth unter der F\u00fchrung des Turianers und langj\u00e4hrigen Spectres Saren angegriffen, welcher versucht, das Artefakt in seinen Besitz zu bringen. Die Geth sind eine vom Volk der Quarianer als Diener erschaffene kybernetische Rasse, die sich gegen ihre Sch\u00f6pfer wandten und diese ins Exil trieben. Shepard kann sie mit seiner Einheit zwar an der Entwendung des Artefakts hindern, doch zerst\u00f6rt sich dieses selbst, als Shepard ihm zu nahe kommt. Dabei brennen sich ihm Visionen ins Bewusstsein, die von der Zerst\u00f6rung von Planeten und aller darauf lebenden Bewohner k\u00fcnden. Im Verlauf des Spiels stellen sich diese als Warnung der Protheaner vor den Angriffen einer technisch weit fortgeschrittenen Rasse, die nur als \u201edie Reaper\u201c bezeichnet wird, heraus. \n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ glaubw\u00fcrdiges SciFi-Universum\n+ unheimlich gro\u00dfe Spielwelt\n+ gutes taktisches Kampfsystem\n+ klasse Waffen- & Biotikeffekte\n+ sehr stimmungsvoller Soundtrack\n+ Entscheidungen mit Konsequenzen\n+ Wiederspielwert dank hoher Levelbegrenzung (60) und alternativer Spielweisen (vorbildlich/skrupellos)\n+ sehr gutes Kreaturendesign der Gegner\n\n[h1] Kontra [/h1]\n\n- zu wenig Leben in der Stadt und Ansprechpartner in den beiden Bars\n- Minimap zeigt auf Planeten sofort alle Zielgebiete an \n- Fahrzeug l\u00e4sst sich nicht aufr\u00fcsten\n- Partymitglieder lassen sich im Kampf nicht einzeln postieren und verhalten sich d\u00e4mlich\n\n[h1] Fazit [/h1]\n\nMass Effect bietet dir ein ScFi-Abenteuer, welches du nicht mehr vergessen wirst, dieses ist von moralischen und emotionalen Konflikten gepr\u00e4gt.

I get the feeling that most people follow the series for the story, which I found to be pretty compelling even if it's a bit dated because it follows the same script a lot of games of that era did.\n\nThe game itself was very glitchy, which I expected but took me out of the moment a great deal. At one point a character was remarking on how marvelous something looked, and it was just a huge black bar for me. Also fell *through* a couple elevators.  Should've just played on console lol.\n\nIt's a lot of fun though, once you figure out how the leveling and abilities work you can really get the ball rolling. The combat system of telling your team what to do every step of the way or else they stand and get pelted by rockets left much to be desired....\n\nanyway, I enjoyed it enough to try Mass Effect 2.

It has the widest variety of dialogue options per conversation. The weapons, armor, and level up system allows you to fine-tune your stats with precision. Weapons using a cool-down timer instead of finite ammunition changes the flow of combat in very interesting ways. It also has the most feet-on-the-ground exploration, and so many sidequests that (despite about 300 hours of gameplay between the two systems) I still haven't found them all. And some of the sidequests are changed by the backgrounds you choose.\n\nDownsides: the sheer volume of the game can feel overwhelming sometimes. If you don't enjoy managing armor and weapon stats, having to do it for your companions can feel tedious. Combat can feel slow, and special attacks lack the flair the later games provide.

I know, today we are in 2020 and the game play is a little outdated, it's more of a vintage RPG game play, however, for being a 2007 game the graphics still hold up pretty well, with facial animation that, back in the day, made us all excited and left us in awe (that's why Andromeda was such a let down as well). This game is a good representation of what Bioware was capable of doing and their strength in story telling. Every choice matters and it impacts your characters. Yes, there is a binary way of playing, either you are a renegade or a paragon and to unlock certain options you will have to lean more in one direction that the other and vicecersa. This is all because of the kind of story they wanted to tell and limitations of the time.\nThe combat is not the best, but that was never the point of this game, it's a story driven RPG that is meant to have you connect with your team and travel the galaxy in order to find a way to defeat the Reapers (the baddies). I replayed it earlier this year and enjoyed it as if it were my first time.\nBecause my console is old (and it is a big game) it's very glitchy, that's why I would suggest to save often and right before fights.\nEven though the combat is meh, there are some aspects that I wish had been transferred in the sequels (I'll review the other 2 as well and explain why there), like the diversity in approach and tension that the different attackers approach you. Because the shooting is so basic and simple, if you are not much of a shooter game person, it won't be a problem, it will actually help you out in getting into them as it did with me.\nAs I mentioned you will be travelling the galaxy, which means you will land on planets for side missions and you will have a chance to use the infamous MAKO. I personally grew to love driven it; you can defy the laws of physics with it, you'll be wanting to throw the controller at the tv or you can challenge yourself in accomplishing this extra challenge the game throws at you lol I now laugh at it and if you go on the internet to watch some videos you will witness the comedy of it all.\nThis is definitely a game everyone needs to experience at least once. the remaster has been announced for 2021 and I can't wait to see how they update this chapter (I am terrified and exhilarated at the same time).", "timestamp_created": 1608571069, "timestamp_updated": 1608571069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82828447": {"recommendationid": "82828447", "author": {"steamid": "76561199020493181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2972, "last_played": 1608568057}, "language": "english", "review": "Once of my favourite franchise of all time!

For some reason after a few tries of trying the pinnacle station the game will freeze during the loading screen. I would just save after completing one and then restarting it if it freezes. Black pixels glitch/bug on Noveria: Peak 15 and also on Illos, I had to add in the ~ command by going to Documents > Bioware > Mass Effect > Config >BIOInput. Slide down until you find [Engine.Console] right underneath it add ConsoleKey=tilde and save and close. (if you're not confident with this copy/save the entire document onto word doc or any other place to save it just in case) and type in \"viewmode unlit\" then enter to turn it off press command key ~ and \"viewmode lit\" while the black pixels are gone the game seems to have brighter settings. It'll be okay its better than black block pixels and also  when you enter the elevator you'll get stuck. Two ways to fix this; First is to save before you enter the elevator and if you get stuck then reload until it works but that takes a while.

Llegados a cierto punto se nos revela que en realidad estan en una mision para ayudar al Consejo de la Ciudadela a recuperar una baliza proteana en Eden Prime y que dicho espectro esta ahi para asegurar el exito de la mision y al mismo tiempo, evaluar a Shepard para ingresarlo en las filas de los espectros.\n\nEl juego en si es un TPS-RPG de aventura espacial con una galaxia que tiene varios sistemas solares con sus respectivos planetas, algunos de ellos explorables mediante un analisis directo de la nave y otros con los pies en tierra con nuestro peloton y nuestro vehiculo.\nEn primer lugar el vehiculo se controla muy mal, pero es tan malo que resulta divertido verlo volar por los aires y casi no hacerse da\u00f1o. Este mismo cuenta con un ca\u00f1on y una gatling para el combate que funcionan similar a las armas normales.\n\nEn segundo lugar vas a contar con un peloton de maximo 2 personajes y tu personaje principal con distintos tipos de habilidades y clases. En este punto es donde mas falla el juego en mi opinion porque si no llevas personajes con habilidades de decodificacion y electronica, eso convierte a Keidan en tu compa\u00f1ero fundamental durante toda la historia porque tiene las 2 juntas.\nAparte de las habilidades standart, cada personaje tendra una habilidad especial en base a su rango (si se trata de humanos) o de su raza si se trata de aliens.\nEn el apartado de armas tendremos 4 tipos: pistolas, fusil de asalto, escopetas y rifles de francotirador. Cada una ellas pueden ser usadas con el personaje principal pero el resto de tus aliados deberan tener el entrenamiento requerido para usar bien cada tipo de arma y algunos siquiera cuentan con dichos entrenamientos.\nLas armas no utilizan municion sino un sistema de calor que hace que regules el dedo a la hora de disparar, basicamente si te pasas disparando vas a tener un cooldown para poder volver a disparar, y creo que no funciona cambiar entre las armas.\n\nCon respecto a la IA tanto de aliados como de enemigos, debo decir que es casi un chiste, dado que los enemigos siempre van a correr hacia vos y en fila para que no tengas ni que moverte a la hora de dispararles y los aliados donde mas balas haya, hacia ahi iran y bien felices con esto, ni dandole ordenes de movimiento podia hacer que se pongan a cobertura solo se paraban en el lugar y se quedaban ahi mirando como si nada pasara. Pero de eso voy a hablar a continuacion.\nPorque con respecto a la interfaz de inventario y el hud son donde el juego mas hace notar su edad, son muy viejos y mal pensados. el inventario permite un maximo de 150 objetos entre armas, armaduras y mejoras, y el problema no es que se quede corto sino que tenes una opcion, hacerlas omnigel que se utiliza para abrir cerraduras al instante, pero que pasa no podes convertir mas de a una por ves y se vuelve muy tedioso tener que hacerlo una por una con un maximo de 999 del mismo.\nY lo mejor de todo esto el hud para dar ordenes al peloton, gracias a dios tiene un sistema para que los aliados usen sus habilidades automaticamente, pero que sino nadie las usaria, para usar una de ellas tendremos que entrar a dicha interfaz y desde ahi dar la orden de la habilidad que queres usar pero si o si tenes que tener apuntado el personaje que queres como objetivo porque una vez que entremos no podremos mover la camara y es una molestia infernal.\nEsta interfaz tambien sirve para cambiar las armas de todo el peloton y para armar un barra de accesos directos a las habilidades de Shepard.\n\nAhora con la exploracion planetaria y los mapas, para los planetas que podemos desembarcar y no sean principales, tendremos como primer encuentro, aunque no pasara en todos, un aviso de comunicacion para informarnos de una mision secundaria en el planeta o sistema, puede que la mision sea de varios planetas e incluso sistemas pero lo mejor es que nunca vas a tener que regresar a ningun lado para entregarla, cuando llegas al final de la mision y la completes bien o mal, recibiras otra llamada con el informe de situacion y unas palabras del que la envie para agradecerte o rega\u00f1arte por no hacerlo bien.\nLos planetas que permiten el desembarco van a ser de mundo abierto con varios puntos de interes y metales para descubrir, sirven como una especie de coleccionable y fuente de ingresos de dinero.\nAhora bien los mapeados de interiores son todos exactamente iguales con detalles diferenciales en base al tipo de fauna o atmosfera que se encuentre en el planeta.\n\nAlgo que no se si esta bueno o malo, pero a mi me parecio bastante bueno, es que no haya que lootear cuerpos, todo se agrega automaticamente al inventario, y dado que hay muchos enemigos en los mapas es un punto muy a favor.\n\n\n\nPara ser un titulo que tiene ya 12 a\u00f1os, me sorprendio para bien, quizas no sea la mejor jugabilidad del mundo ni los mejores graficos, pero la historia es interesante y te incita a jugar mas y avanzar. Lo unico que te frena un poco es lo repetitivo que se vuelve a la hora de explorar y hacer todas las misiones secundarias porque vas a estar viendo todo el tiempo los mismos mapas y mismas situaciones una y otra vez. Asi y todo lo recomiendo porque como primer inicio de una trilogia esta mas que interesante y ya jugue un poco de Mass Effect 2 y los cambios son brutales tanto visualmente como jugables, no se si para bien o peor todavia pero ya lo averiguare.", "timestamp_created": 1606757694, "timestamp_updated": 1606757694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680183827877044678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81245904": {"recommendationid": "81245904", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998105575", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 748, "last_played": 1606867748}, "language": "english", "review": "Mass Effect is a deep, intriguing world built around relatively well thought-out sci-fi and character interaction.

I had heard good things about it and gave it a go over Christmas Break during my sophomore year of college.  Early on, I loved the s*** out of it.  Nowadays...I still love the s*** out of it.  \n\nI have played each of the main trilogy games about ten times, both on xbox and PC.  I am fond of each of the games, though in different ways and for different reasons.  Gun to my head, I would probably pick the first one as the best; yes, it's the clunkiest of the three, but it is also the most RPG of the three.  \n\nIf you are looking for a gameplay challenge, I recommend playing something else; I have beaten this game on the hardest difficulty without my main character firing a shot or using an offensive power (and I did every single side mission [I did not do Pinnacle Station] and took care of just about every enemy in the game).   In the course of that playthrough I died once.  It's not that I am amazing at the game; it is that once Shepard levels up enough, the combat is pretty trivial.  Still, I find the fighting enjoyable as there are many ways to approach fights and the biotic powers are particularly over the top.  \n\nThe soundtrack to this game is terrific.  \n\nThis game has a little Deus Ex in it, as it has some clunky mechanics; the inventory system has some annoying features; why can I not convert batches of items to omni-gel?  It still beats the system from the sequels that nerfed the hell out of your inventory.  \n\nAnother aspect of the game that draws the ire of some fans is the Mako, the tank you drive around that was removed in subsequent games.  I love the Mako.  Does it handle like the Possum Van from Red Green?  Yes.  Do the shields regenerate slower than old people f***?  Yes.  Occasionally glitch and fling itself airborne until it sustains sufficient damage to bring on a \"Mission Failed\" message?  Yep.  But I still love that vehicle; exploring planets and moons was instrumental to making the world seem huge and mysterious.  The fact that this sucker could climb 80 degree slopes only added to my affection for it.  \n\nThe characters are largely excellent and this game features the best antagonist of the series.  \n\nI recommend this game very highly.", "timestamp_created": 1606391981, "timestamp_updated": 1606392034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80140641": {"recommendationid": "80140641", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078230411", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1792, "last_played": 1606322650}, "language": "english", "review": "POSSIR", "timestamp_created": 1606370194, "timestamp_updated": 1606370194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80108653": {"recommendationid": "80108653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014989306", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 10671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10671, "last_played": 1587015857}, "language": "english", "review": "A game truly before it's time.

A lot of people forget how many annoying bugs and problems this game has. I don't. 175 hours keeps it fresh in your memory. I can't stand the way Shepard inadvertently dodges behind objects you're to run past. All the freedom of movement in Andromeda made me forget how literally stuck to the ground you are in these games. It's not just Andromeda, even in the second and especially the third game, Shepard's movement is far more quick and nimble. Here it's like you have ridiculous sudden bursts of uncontrollable speed followed by jamming the sprint key, but moving like jello pudding on cement cobblestones. I imagine in the \"real world\" I probably would run out of adrenaline in a firefight with aliens and take a piss, but it's annoying in a game to die because you suddenly can't run away fast enough.  \n\nDespite all that I still love this game. I hold my breath a little every time I hear the theme music play in the opening menu. That familiar tune. The one that pulls at you in some deep complicated emotional way. Movement and combat and inventory management all suck, but the story is so damn good. The twists and turns and the company you keep and the friends you make along the way. The game really does feel like a whole universe of characters and lore to learn about and explore. And it's fun knowing that both of its sequels really build on the story telling, character development, and world building. Decisions you make in this game really do carry over and have some impact on even the third game. There's no other series in gaming that's like that. B-movie scifi that's so epic in it's scope by the third game it seems almost ready to implode on itself with ridiculousness and yet it prevails somehow. It's not the overall plot and story about the threat to the galaxy, it's all the tiny little moments in between where you make your own dialogue choices and you chose one option over another and you build your Shepard your own way and by the end of it all it really feels like you had your own unique experience. It's all a clever illusion of course--given the limited amount of options, a significant percentage of other players had a similar experience, but it still works and I still like it. \n\nAndromeda's failure is all the more acute given just how impressive this whole series was and the fact that the developers already created a winning formula. The \"save the galaxy\" story isn't new and didn't really need better writing for the sake of all the little moments in between that make the magic. Still I feel like Andromeda is a better game if they made it like Mass Effect and not too open world-y like Inquisition. Inquisition was able to support the weight of a massive open world because of two huge prior games of successive lore. Hundreds of hours of lore, actually, and as such a good playthrough of any Dragon Age game took at least 80 to 100 hours. No Mass effect game ever lasted more that 40 hours and then suddenly with Andromeda they think they can support a brand new galaxy, devoid of lore with over 80 hours of boring unrelated crap. If all the content of Andromeda was edited down to fit the size of previous games, it would've been a hit, because they would've been able to fix all the issues that had at release; before release, and they would've probably delivered something like a better looking more fleshed out version of this game. But I digress. \n\nIf you're looking to play it now, you might as well wait for the remasters next spring at time of this writing. But you should definitely play it.

As for the game itself, its more ponderous than the other ME games but ends up still being fun and I love me some hard science fiction, which this game goes hard in on.

In short, the role-playing mechanics, plot, and world building in ME1 are top notch, but the shooter and exploration mechanics are thoroughly clunky.\n\nLet's begin with the negatives.\n\nThe shooter mechanics in ME1 can vary from passable to horrendously clunky. In my first playthrough ever (I've played through the Mass Effect trilogy three times), I chose the \"Infiltrator\" class, which mixes strong tech abilities with long range combat (having masteries for pistols and sniper rifles). Bad choice! As it turns out, the game artificially makes your aim with the sniper rifle wobbly, and you can only fix this wobble by maxing out your sniper rifle mastery as quickly as possible. Who does that? If the accuracy mechanic had instead revolved around having high recoil issues at first, I'd understand, but instead I got the equivalent of Shepard fighting while heavily inebriated. Furthermore, because of the high cooldowns and the lack of combo mechanics you see in later games, ME1's combat ends up feeling very clunky and oddly paced. You also end up facing an overwhelming amount of geth (robots) throughout the game.\n\nThe exploration mechanics are also rough to deal with. Driving the Mako alone felt like the stuff of meme dreams, with its bizarre physics. Still, at least the Mako provides comic relief; on the other hand, the extremely long and tedious side-quests (gathering Matriarch Dilinaga's writings, identifying natural resources/ores, etc) set against the backdrop of entire worlds that seem to just be terrain maps with textures on top make for a boring experience, especially when those side-quests are actually relevant to plot threads in later games. The tedium of the exploration mechanics is the #1 reason why I often skip re-playing ME1 in my Mass Effect trilogy playthroughs (I opt to load older saves instead).\n\nOn to the positives, then!\n\nThe world-building of ME1 is *amazing.* Whether it's the collision of species and cultures at the Citadel or the extensive amount of information in the codex, ME1 delivers on the promise of a vibrant, lived-in galaxy. This is something you'll have to see for yourself, but on world-building alone ME1 is worth at least one playthrough. Salarians, turians, asari, krogan, geth, honestly, even just writing about it makes me want to dive right back in to the Mass Effect universe. Characters are informed by their backgrounds but quite often break the in-universe stereotypes built around them, giving them all a sense of realistic variation.\n\nThe plot of ME1 is also excellent; if it *somehow* hasn't been spoiled for you, then I would strongly suggest playing through it and uncovering the mysteries behind Saren's plot for yourself.\n\nThe roleplaying element of ME1 is also decent, but I would argue that it's not possible to really judge the roleplaying element on ME1 alone. Taken across the trilogy as a whole, the roleplaying is amazing (aside from the hiccup that was ME3's original ending). As far as ME1 alone goes, I feel like the original roleplaying system of ME1 feels aged compared to the systems we see in ME2 and ME3. Still, there are many decisions that you make in ME1 that you only see the fruits of in ME2 and ME3, and on that alone I would argue that if you are at all interested in playing through ME2 or ME3, you should start with ME1.\n\nAs a final note, femshep x Liara forever!", "timestamp_created": 1605671625, "timestamp_updated": 1605671625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79436351": {"recommendationid": "79436351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072918069", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3064, "last_played": 1641069636}, "language": "english", "review": "Only little to say about the introductory game to this masterpiece trilogy.

As a long time sci-fi reader, the premise of Mass Effect has been one that I was excited by, but (at least in 2008) RPG's not being my thing, the game never really got to the top of my backlog until I finished KOTOR and figured I\u2019d see what Bioware could do when not tied down by a licensed property.\n\nThe result is interesting, I disagree that Mass Effect is as good as many of the other reviews suggest, but then I've not played it multiple times over the last decade!   It certainly is a good game, and a game that does leave me wanting to play the sequel.   Ultimately though, I won\u2019t be bothering with the DLC (available for free from EA\u2019s site) as it\u2019s the story that I want to continue, not the gameplay.\nGraphically the game is nothing special, but it\u2019s more than adequate, and I had no real bugs to speak of. Importantly (except for potato-head Captain Anderson) nothing stood out as particularly god-awful, which was nice given how Windows 10 can behave at times.    Sound wise, the game is excellent, with superb voice acting throughout, and none of the incidental sounds (shooting, shields etc.) being too grating. Music is serviceable \u2013 I didn\u2019t get goosebumps when it surged for dramatic moments, but it wasn\u2019t irritating either.\n\nWhat the game does badly however is the actual gameplay. As a character-development RPG it struggles a bit: although the skill tree is extensive, I had loads of unspent points at the end of the game simply because I didn't need them.  In the end I spent some to max out charisma and intimidation in the expectation of an end-game debate-off, but that turned out to be unnecessary.    On the other hand, combat did feel more impactful than say KOTOR in that the illusion of skill-based shooting is maintained in Mass Effect and weapons usually seem to make contact, but don\u2019t expect the quality of shooting seen in say Deus Ex Mankind Divided.  It is a shame then that the combat mostly feels rote \u2013 shooting is basically sniping in bursts with the assault rifle with virtually all the other guns (possible exception of the sniper rifle for a few select moments) being irrelevant.   Combat skills are utterly irrelevant, I only used one (resurrect downed members of the party) and only during the final battle - In the previous 25 hours of gameplay I never once needed to bother with the other combat skills!      Weapons and other equipment are mostly acquired through random drops (you can buy them from shops but honestly don't bother) and truthfully the effect was an experience more like Borderlands (looter/shooter with random weapon spawns) than Doom 2016 (defined guns with points adding new abilities).\n\nSome odd things that did crop up, which I imagine are because of my play style and only playing through once: I occasionally came across containers I couldn\u2019t hack due to low electronics skill, but it was never made clear if/how I could resolve that (my Shephard didn\u2019t have the electronics skill); my companions never seemed to level, so I couldn\u2019t improve them (why give me heavy Turian armor if my Turian companion can never take above light armor?).    My sense on these is that there was some aspect of the tutorial that I managed to miss, but again, if I can complete the game without having to level the companions, maybe it simply doesn\u2019t matter?\n\nAll of the above complaints are irrelevant however, because you're here for the story and the story does deliver (even if it does feel a bit like one long cutscene at times).   The overarching premise being Humanity is a newcomer to the galactic stage and is trying to prove that it is ready for a seat at the adult\u2019s table.   Meanwhile a villain is working to unleash doom on the entire galaxy.    The story then is not \u2018hard sci-fi\u2019, but Bioware proved they can do space-opera with KOTOR and this is good space opera.    The evil menace treads dangerously close at times to Star Control 3 (with the big reveal in particular making me sigh at the similarity), but in fairness, I think the telling of the story is better here.   I can recommend the game based purely on this story and presentation alone.\nWhat does stand out though is that the game expects certain things to happen, and thus when it makes these assumptions it can be jarring.    I spent the first half or so the game taking Wrex on every mission, the friendly walking shark-man was great in a fight and his snarky comments were continually amusing.    Until the game decided that he needed to be removed (one way or another, for story reasons), and for better or worse, my dialogue choices meant the irritating human female companion murdered him.   The irritating human companion that I hadn\u2019t had any interaction with since meeting her in the first mission...   When we were back on the ship the game decided that there was obviously chemistry between us and we were set up to kiss.  Fortunately, a clich\u00e9 interruption saved the day, but in another scene later I had to carefully navigate to delay having sex with this character I actively disliked.   Now I can enjoy the \u2018got to bang \u2018em all\u2019 mini-games in the Witcher and the like, but in a story driven game I would prefer to \u2018want\u2019 to collect the card, and frankly the irritating woman I barely know who just murdered my best (man-shark) friend isn\u2019t someone I want to collect.\nThe game also struggles with various beats where choices that feel wrong \u2013 e.g. what feels like a polite \u2018no\u2019 results in an aggressive \u2018get lost\u2019 response; or worse, (as with the love interest above) the choice on screen has the exact opposite meaning to the one the player says out loud.   My favorite example of this being the final choice in the game where the \u2018it\u2019s not over yet\u2019 option had my character practically yell \u2018I\u2019ll do it myself then\u2019 before storming off like a petulant child.  For the most part these moments are not impactful, and I recall reading complaints about this back when the game came out, so hopefully ME2 is better.   \n\nThe overall result then, and a recommendation \u2013 do play this game, if you are at all interested in story-driven gaming then Mass Effect is good, if you\u2019re also a fan of science fiction, then it\u2019s very good.   It will not have you feel like Captain Kirk (play 25th anniversary), nor is it a great shooting game (just play Doom 2016), nor is it a touchpoint that redefined the entire genre of RPG\u2019s.  There are more intelligent RPGs out there, ones with better combat, and even some with better stories.  However, there are few games that do all of those things well, along with wonderful voice acting and some serviceable combat along the way.", "timestamp_created": 1605154554, "timestamp_updated": 1605154569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79133005": {"recommendationid": "79133005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198977508557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1860, "last_played": 1605153588}, "language": "english", "review": "Hours of fun, though you can out level the ending if you do all the side quests", "timestamp_created": 1605153755, "timestamp_updated": 1605153755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79113795": {"recommendationid": "79113795", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973167263", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1605304628}, "language": "english", "review": "The worst game for marksman class.", "timestamp_created": 1605119775, "timestamp_updated": 1605119775, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445625245571136475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79091810": {"recommendationid": "79091810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182513822", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 756, "last_played": 1680286991}, "language": "english", "review": "dawdawdaw", "timestamp_created": 1605085661, "timestamp_updated": 1605085661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79086832": {"recommendationid": "79086832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048584414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2257, "last_played": 1605169154}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1605074641, "timestamp_updated": 1605074641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79083637": {"recommendationid": "79083637", "author": {"steamid": "76561199054698142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 746, "last_played": 1654829822}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is excellent!!

I had it happen during one entire quest and then a mini quest near the end of the game, there are fixes out their in the forums but I myself was simply too dumb & lazy to fix it so I just fought through shooting and broken textures with my black blob of a squad.

I bought the game on what I had been told from an old friend \u201coh it\u2019s a brilliant series I would recommend playing it\u201d or something to that description. After purchasing the game, it took me 2-3 playthroughs of the introduction sequence to get into the gameplay and how the game would play out but, in the end, I completed the game and moved on to the sequel.After 6-7 years of not playing any of the Mass Effect series it has been a good time to come back to this starting off with the first.\n\nACTUAL REVIEW STARTS HERE\n\nThe game opens with a character customisation screen where you can create your own character from scratch with your own first name but you cannot change the second name (this might be down to the many voice lines that have already been done to fit for the name \u201cShepard\u201d and also the symbolism behind the name Shepard which makes sense further down the line. I stuck with the default character and name because I\u2019m not fussed with character customisation, I think this point of view might have been because of the Metal Gear Solid V fiasco with its ambiguous ending (another review for another time).\n\nThe game opens with you and your crew aboard the SSV Normandy flying through the vast reaches of space towards an Earth-clan planet \u201cEden Prime\u201d where yourself and your crew find that its under attack with this spawns several plot points where the Commander (yourself) is brought into question by the Galaxy Council (an overarching political power that spans across the galaxies) and you then set out on you journey across the milky way coming across several characters with interesting backgrounds and several quests that question the moralities of the open space.\n\nThe overall game has been made out to be a clunky mess which in all honesty it is the way the characters move and the camera move already give the clunkiness away and if you see the sprint mechanic then it explains it, I do honestly feel that this game was an amalgamation of different mechanics that was slapped together with no clean up intended but in all honesty I love it because it works for a game introducing a world that has been built from scratch and for something trying to find its way which in its sequel seems to have been narrowed down more.\n\nThe RPG elements of the game are something that I wish were adapted into the later games but for a few different reasons I can understand why it was streamlined in 2 and 3, when you level up you are brought to a screen with various points categories (assault rifles, shotguns, pistols etc.) but it goes a bit more in depth with spending points on Paragon and Renegade categories which is your basic Good/Evil points if you want to be good spend points in this category and vice versa. These points do you make you stronger, but god does it make you work for it in the early levels.\n\nMaking conversations is the name of the game with the type of storytelling this game holds dear, making sure to know your crew is one way to proceed down a good path in this game so make sure to talk to people who are important ( yeah I know its awkward to say that but once spending a bit of time in the game you\u2019ll be able to pick up who will advance your character and who won\u2019t).\n\nSometimes the direction of where the game is wanting you to go can be confusing to read so be sure to read your journal and map to see where your points of interest are else you\u2019ll get lost really quickly (like I did).Overall, the game is great but there is one thing that brings the game to a stuttering halt and its not the quiet moments . . .. it\u2019s the areas where you must drive a planet rover to get to a location the way this thing controls it sucks ass. Overall a great game that I would recommend especially if you want to introduce yourself to a saga if you can put up with the clunkiness and sort of bugs that this game has then definitely play this but in all honesty one tip. . . . .

However, I still highly recommend this game, the story is amazing and is something I think every gamer or fan of sci-fi should experience at least once. \n\nThe game play is a blend of RPG and third person shooting games, which was quite a novel idea when it came out and honestly hasn't been implemented well or really built upon in any other game series that comes to mind. Instead of finding swords or axes and magical gems to enhance them you are finding shotguns or assault rifles and weapon mods. Instead of magic you have special \"biotic\" abilities or tech based skills like hacking into AI's. The choices you make matter, and the characters you encounter are all memorable. \n\nMost important thing to do if trying to run ME1 on modern machines:\n\n- Getting this to run on modern machines smoothly is a bit of a pain- there's a \"black box\" glitch where in certain levels of the game all characters become black smudgy boxes and it's impossible to figure out what is going on. There are some mods that are hit-or-miss that fix this, and some console commands create a temporary fix but make the game look ugly AF. The best workaround is to download the MEUITM mods - never encountered any graphical errors from this and it makes the game look AMAZING. \n\nHere are the only bad things I can say about ME1: \n\n- Encountered a few glitches where my character would get stuck on some part of the map or some enemies would get stuck behind a door/within something else prompting me to reload the game to move forward. Happened a few times, and I'm not entirely sure if this was caused at all by MEUITM. More of an annoyance, but should be noted.\n\n- The MAKO - this particular aspect of the game hasn't aged well at all. This is your all terrain vehicle that is part of a few missions in the game, and part of the bulk of the side missions in the game. While it is cool to visit these new planets to search for alien relics, respond to distress signals, or even blow up a rogue military combat AI on the moon, it painfully slows down the game's pace. The MAKO has a pretty powerful cannon and a machine gun that is good at whittling down enemy shields, but it handles so poorly and unpredictably that it makes it's sections become painful to go through. Either the MAKO is too slow for some of the massive maps, or the maps are just too big for the MAKO's top speed- I can't tell. The side-mission maps are pretty barren, with only 3-5 points of interest usually, and it's rarely got a few enemies. \n\n- The layout of pretty much all the side-missions outside of the Citadel are either these warehouse complexes, or underground bunkers on barren planets or these freighter ships with more or less the same layout. Yeah there might be some boxes in different locations, but the visual aesthetics and general layout is the same. They become noticeably predictable after a few encounters.\n\n- Combat starts off pretty good- the balance is between skill-based shooting and squad/ability tactics against certain enemy types. Certain ammo types are good against certain enemies or provide elemental damage. The problem is later on in the game it doesn't really feel like the enemies scale up with you. What feels like hundreds of armour and weapon types all feel the same (outside of some visual aesthetics) and by the time the weapons feel different (the Geth assault rifle in particular) it's close to the endgame - and you'll have much better weapons by that point. I had done every side quest before doing the final story missions and I would barely have to be in cover to kill most enemies. The only times I died was from rocket launcher wielding enemies which pretty much kill you in one or two hits - and those deaths just felt cheap. This isn't really a problem with the game, but more so with how well the game has aged. Combat in the other games is significantly better. This traditional levelling RPG system for weapons and armour just doesn't really work with the way the cover-based shooting mechanic works. Later games would make weapons and armour revolve around the shooting mechanics and the RPG elements would be strictly limited to the dialog options and character/tech development paths. \n\n- The load times in this game are pretty much a meme these days. The long elevator rides - while offering some interesting conversations with characters in your party at times, are painfully obvious as ways to load the next area. Transitions between areas and even just getting place to place takes a bit longer than it does in most modern games. Playing the game for the first time this never really bothered me and it definitely doesn't break the immersion in the game, but is something that should be noted. There are mods that can speed up transitions.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nYou should DEFINITELY play this game if you are interested in the ME series or just want to play a good RPG with a sci-fi theme. Playing this for the story is what your goal should be. Definitely play this if you have any interest in playing ME2 or ME3, as your choices will carry over into those games. \n", "timestamp_created": 1600142919, "timestamp_updated": 1600142919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75980517": {"recommendationid": "75980517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802649391", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1126, "last_played": 1581746845}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1600121136, "timestamp_updated": 1600121136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75967678": {"recommendationid": "75967678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967704798", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2781, "last_played": 1600101083}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite of lackluster gunplay, ME 1 deliver one of the best story in gaming, with a cast of fleshed-out characters.

Before diving into the review, it's essential to note that there's another version available, \"[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328670/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition/]Mass Effect: Legendary Edition[/url],\" a fully remastered compilation of the first three ME games. While some OG fans might have preferences due to visual differences, the remaster surpasses the original in several aspects, including visuals, gameplay, and bug fixes. The remaster also includes one of the two ME1 DLCs without external installers. Although the original has an additional DLC, it's not a compelling reason to choose it over the remaster. The remaster offers the complete ME trilogy and its DLCs at a significantly lower price than the originals combined. You can check my review for the remaster [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/recommended/1328670?snr=1_5_9__402]here[/url].\n\nFor newcomers or players looking to experience one version of the first Mass Effect game, I highly recommend checking out the remaster. Both versions hold their charm, but I personally prefer the remaster for its enhancements.\n\nWhile I'm unsure of the game's state at launch, there are apparent issues that affect the experience. Thanks to PCGamingWiki and dedicated Mass Effect fans, there are ways to enjoy the game despite these problems. Following a comprehensive guide before playing is crucial to avoid potential problems. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2450534696]Check mine out.[/url] The game's stuttering issue, especially for AMD users, can be persistent, but overall patches and updates have improved the experience.\n\nNow, onto the game itself. \"Mass Effect\" captivates players from the start with its outstanding narrative and world-building. The story, characters, and alien races are fascinating, immersing players in a captivating cosmos. Engaging character hubs, conversations, decisions, and consequences shape a personalized Shepard journey, forging a deep attachment to the protagonist.\n\nWhile the gameplay might not be groundbreaking, it remains great. The combat mechanics are solid, and the RPG elements are well-executed, contributing to the game's allure. Though the squad mechanics might be an acquired taste, they add depth and strategy to the experience.\n\nExploring planets in the iconic Mako might be divisive, as beautiful visuals clash with monotonous environments. Yet, landing on these planets remains a breathtaking experience with awe-inspiring landscapes and skies.\n\nA key point to keep in mind is that \"Mass Effect\" lacks post-game exploration and side-mission completion after finishing the final main mission, setting it apart from other RPGs.\n\nFor achievement hunters: one minor disappointment is the absence of in-game achievements on Steam, regardless of earning all 49 of them. It's unfortunate that others won't witness these achievements. I can share my progress only by [url=https://imgur.com/gallery/KdEyLG9]screenshots[/url], on my [url=https://backloggery.com/games.php?user=ciocolici&search=Mass+Effect&alpha=1]Backloggery[/url], or written by myself on my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/]Steam profile[/url].\nIf you do decide to still do them, you're in for a ride, my friend. I have 143 hours in this game. And that does not even include the time I've spent on the Origin version I own (now EA App). Although I don't remember how much time it took me to beat the game, you can be sure it wasn't 100. The achievements in this game are outrageous. Very grindy. You need a lot of time and patience. A shame I can only see them in-game.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Mass Effect\" is a remarkable and memorable game with a captivating story and enjoyable gameplay. Though it faces some challenges, it remains a masterpiece and the gateway to an unparalleled video game series. If you're ready to embark on a thrilling intergalactic journey, Mass Effect is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1599677840, "timestamp_updated": 1696196408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75706903": {"recommendationid": "75706903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066119142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5126, "last_played": 1599670833}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good, old game.", "timestamp_created": 1599669922, "timestamp_updated": 1599669922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75696190": {"recommendationid": "75696190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198903125767", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 672, "last_played": 1596292365}, "language": "english", "review": "duuhhh alien sex haha ooo boing boing haha alien uh boobies!\n\n\nthe writing,universe, and story are all incredible. gameplay is definitely aged and can be pretty frustrating at time tbh.", "timestamp_created": 1599655622, "timestamp_updated": 1606580913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75685287": {"recommendationid": "75685287", "author": {"steamid": "76561199050401436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2270, "last_played": 1621212732}, "language": "english", "review": "Mass Effect has a unique allure that invites the player into the world it creates.

Maybe not, because again, the gameplay sucks. So it really depends on how willing you are to go through it. But then again, who's to say you'll like the gameplay in the sequel? I like it, but maybe you won't, and then you've forced yourself through the game for naught. But even in that case, the story is still really REALLY good.\n\nI recommend playing on easy. Could you just watch a video on YouTube? Probably, but Mass Effect is still an RPG at heart, and the choices you make carry over to the next game. Also, the experience and pacing of going through the game yourself is still miles ahead of just watching someone else play. If the gameplay is truly unbearably though, I don't think it's such a bad idea to watch a video. But do watch the video!

I highly recommend, especially if you're a fan of the other games. Here's what I think.\n\nCONS:\nGraphically, it has not aged well. The graphics weren't \"great\", even in 2008. Yet, it looks good enough for nostalgia.\nThe controls weren't refined yet. Sometimes, it's frustrating trying to do simple things, such as stick to walls. Not too bad...\nDecisions have little impact on the ending. There are small variations but nothing surprising.\nSome of the side missions are boring, honestly. I hate fetch quests.\n\nPROS:\nThe story is fantastic, although there are moments of too much dialog. You'll find your deeply immersed, after a few games.

Now I wish I played this game earlier. It's a wonderful Sci-fi RPG.\n \n Pros:\n\n  The lore of ME. Absorbing and rich. Particularly, the parts about the history of relations between races.\n\n  Different locations. Citadel, Normandy (small, but amazing if you enjoy listening to your companions' stories. Plus, the ship is just astonishing), Feros, Noveria and so on. I like the idea of hazardous environments where player and their escort  use helmets. \n\n  Various alien species. Asari, Salarians, Turians, Krogans, and so on. Every race is different and feels unique. My favourite one is Krogans. The mix of dwarves and lizzards is amazing. They as cool as dwarves in Witcher books and games.\n\n  Music. For me it suits perfectly and helps better feel the game. Somewhat remainds me KOTOR.\n\n  Quests. Especially ones about corporations. I like their realistic grey tone.\n\n  No bugs. Game works perfectly. I haven't noticed any bugs.\n\n  Cons:\n\n  Some side quests are tiresome with little variety in locations. Side note: I haven't completed all side quests. For example, in one quest an officer of Human's fleet said me to destroy the disobedient robots on the Moon base. It turned out that I had to clean three exactly the same small underground bases. Only one thing I enjoyed from that quest was the view on Earth from the Moon's surface: Earth looked gorgeous from there.\n  \n", "timestamp_created": 1597658714, "timestamp_updated": 1597658714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74444148": {"recommendationid": "74444148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386846311", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1621922227}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality game. Make sure you download the DLC. It can all be found for free elsewhere online through genuinely legal channels, but isn't available on Steam for some reason.  \n\nThe game is good. It runs well. It looks like a pretty game from 2008, but it is obviously still from 2008. Make sure you turn off the film grain in the graphics menu. It makes the visuals much better.\n\nThe story structure follows the Bioware formula, but is overall well told and interesting all throughout. The sidequests can be dull, but all the main content is engaging. The morality system feels dated and overly-simplistic, rewarding ethical min-maxing over roleplaying. The story is enhanced fairly dramatically by playing a female main character as the male voice-actor feels very wooden. The rest of the voice talent in the game is excellent, so it's strange that they dropped the ball on the protagonist. The female voice actress is quite good though, so just play as a girl and you'll be fine. \n\nGameplay is fun. There's a strong difficulty spike when you first leave the Citadel as the game adjusts to your character's newfound freedom, but everything before and after isn't too challenging.

They had a string of straight back to back hits with the first two Mass Effect games and Dragon Age: Origins. While DA was more of their traditional bread and butter, ME was whole new territory, and thankfully, they succeeded. Well over a decade after its initial release, however, its flaws have become more pronounced, but the fact that I still love going back to play through it to completion speaks volumes to its overall staying power.\n\nYou take on the role of Commander Shepard. You'll recruit various characters to your mission and make difficult decisions that not only affect you personally, but the galaxy as a whole. ME may take cues from many well-known sci-fi properties, but they were also able to put their own spin on them, with various races with their own distinct style, personality and culture. More importantly, your party members are interesting and fun to talk to. The more I play ME, the more I appreciate certain details about this game that I never did the first time around.\n\nAt its core, it is an RPG with elements of a third-person shooter. The general shooting mechanics, on their own, are functional but not nearly as smooth as their contemporaries. You can be either a Soldier with access to every available weapon and armor, Biotic with magic-like force abilities but with a limited load out, or Engineer that can break hard-to-crack safes and mess with synthetics. Depending on your class you'll need to choose a team that best suits your needs.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of Mass Effect is its emphasis on choice. Right out of the gate you can choose a basic background for Shepard, which can effect how characters interact with you and what side missions would be available. How you interact with people fills up either a Paragon or Renegade meter that further unlocks additional choices you can make. This system isn't perfect, but still gets the job done.\n\nAs I've said, ME has definitely begun to show its age. While the game for its time looked incredible, some of the environments come off rather dull and uninspired. Conversations with characters are also pretty static, but thankfully the solid voice acting carries them through. General sound editing is all over the place and much of the music is repetitive and rather forgettable. Mako is simultaneously floaty and stiff, making traveling on more rugged terrain a nightmare. There are a good variety of planets to explore, but most don't contain much to do. Much of the sidequests take place in like four locations that are laid out exactly the same and it is visually dull, and yet I still go out of my way to do each of them because there is still an addicting quality to the exploration and side missions.\n\nWhile far from perfect, I still believe ME is definitely worth looking into, especially since you can import your save data into ME2 and see where things progress. I'd say you can probably get away with calling the original ME a \"flawed masterpiece\".

Well, first I want to talk about something called Starbucks' rule in the Ronald Moore Battlestar Galactica episode \"scar\" from season two, Starbuck gave a younger and newer pilot some advice which says in so many words \"turn into every attack never run, run and you're dead\" now while this doesn't turn out brilliantly in the episode because the young pilot seems to be something of an idiot, this advice is almost always incredibly important because the first thing you need to understand about dogfighting in space in any kind of science fiction setting: there's contrived reasons for there to be dogfighting in space, they have to understand that there is no atmosphere and there is no ground, you're fighting in a vacuum that is almost always free of anything that could be described as terrain, now in an environment like this almost everything will be able to turn on a sixpence, there's no air resistance, nobody's going to be banking slowly, it's going to be far more difficult to predict people's movements because they're going to be able to change them far more quickly -- and if you're caught in a turning battle with another fighter you're trying to stay behind them and they're trying to stay behind you and then suddenly for some reason you want to get away because you've run out of missiles or your fuel's low and you feel like you need to ditch the engagement. That advice Starbuck gave suddenly becomes incredibly apparent because if you break off...you die...you can't escape a dogfight like this because if you're suddenly flying away in a straight line and they're suddenly in a straight line to pursue you there is a massive window of opportunity where you've got your back pointed at them and get out of range which will be 6 or 7 seconds minimum, if you're that close and suddenly present a static unmoving target that can't fire back for a few seconds anybody with even basic competence will shoot you down let alone a hyper-intelligent Cylon Raider, so what Starbuck suggests instead is that you continue to turn into every, attack no matter how badly it's looking, no matter how screwed you seem to be the, best bet is always to keep turning and keep trying to win.\n", "timestamp_created": 1596937670, "timestamp_updated": 1596937670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73996119": {"recommendationid": "73996119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114586751", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 999, "last_played": 1596908548}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Mass Effect | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606[/b]\n\nI started this game with a high expectation and finished it satisfied.

In the latter parts, BioWare ups their game on fleshing out characters and combat, respectively, but you really want the full Mass Effect treatment.\n\nWhile ME1 is the most dated, revealed by somewhat stiff RPG and combat mechanics, it sets the stage for an epic story with its excellent worldbuilding and political intrigue. It still looks great (and even better with the high-quality mods available), and the atmosphere of the main plotline is palpable, with several scenes sending chills up your spine.\n\nI'd perhaps recommend keeping the difficulty level modest, grabbing a few quality-of-life and visual mods, and enjoying the story.", "timestamp_created": 1596884198, "timestamp_updated": 1596884198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73927895": {"recommendationid": "73927895", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978845339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 584, "last_played": 1598496501}, "language": "english", "review": "In 2020 ME still has a lot of things going for it. The character building, dialogue, and general meaningful options to make are great. Starting here to build a character, and bringing them through the series still feels really rewarding. That said...\n\nThis game has not aged all that well in many other areas. It's not terrible, but the combat and AI are both EXTREMELY clunky and difficult to deal with. It feels like your squad AI is virtually non-existent, but spending time telling them what to do is also futile because they will typically do nothing and die regardless of instruction. (maybe every button secretly maps to \"DIE ASAP\") Combine this with ULTRA AGGRESSIVE ENEMY AI (sprinting straight at you and pummeling you to death, hiding directly behind closed doors with shotguns/rockets... even AI in DOOM wasn't this obnoxious) it can get a bit annoying. Also, you die REAL fast. Many times I have no idea how it even happens. Probably my fault, I guess. \n\nHere is the real problem: Most of my play sessions end with the game crashing, bugging out, glitching, or somehow otherwise finding ways to reset my progress 30+ minutes at a time. The autosave function in this game is nearly worthless (it seems only to save at critical mission junctures, not on a timer or with any regularity) forcing you to CONSTANTLY auto-save, or risk being cheese'd by enemy AI, or the game just straight up freezing and forcing you to alt+f4 out. \n\nTLDR; I want to play back through the ME series.

Well here we are. 67 hours to do three playthroughs and 100% the title. \n\nThe combat does still feel dated but it plays cleanly. The RPG elements, story, and world building are second to none. Playing on the harder difficulties can be kind of a slog as some of the enemy abilities make them simply unkillable for an extended period of time. And having to drive the Mako can be the most frustrating and pointless experience in any game I remember.
