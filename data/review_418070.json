This unique and enjoyable experience is worth sharing, as it successfully piques interest and offers a delightful adventure.\n\nFrom the moment you dive into the gameplay, it's impossible not to be captivated by the enchanting visuals that radiate an undeniable aura of adorableness. The masterful developers have woven a tapestry of visual delight, and the endearing pug protagonists only serve to enhance the game's enchantment.\n\nThe gameplay, featuring procedurally generated levels and weather elements, injects a degree of unpredictability into each run. This ensures that no two playthroughs feel exactly the same, maintaining a high level of engagement throughout.\n\nOne standout aspect is the system for unlocking new costumes and characters. Each unlock comes with its own set of moves, effectively creating a doggy wardrobe with unique abilities. This feature adds an enjoyable layer of motivation for players to explore further and experiment with different combinations.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, Turbo Pug strikes a fine balance catering to a wide range of players. It avoids being overly challenging, making it accessible to casual gamers, while still offering enough obstacles to keep it from feeling too easy. This middle ground is appreciated, allowing players to enjoy the game without becoming overly frustrated.\n\nHowever, one area where the game could improve is in adding more elements of distraction during races. While the graphics and adorable pug characters are endearing, a bit more gameplay variety could enhance the overall experience.\n\nIn sum, Turbo Pug delivers a charming and visually delightful adventure. The graphics and unlockable costumes add an enjoyable layer to the gameplay, and the balance of difficulty makes it accessible to a broad audience. While it might lack some deeper gameplay elements, it still manages to provide a pleasant and enjoyable gaming experience for those seeking a lighthearted escapade.", "timestamp_created": 1689776250, "timestamp_updated": 1697055617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142091485": {"recommendationid": "142091485", "author": {"steamid": "76561199102485321", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1689798472}, "language": "english", "review": "achievement of my life <3", "timestamp_created": 1689374039, "timestamp_updated": 1689374039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141870960": {"recommendationid": "141870960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011855157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1691379330}, "language": "english", "review": "Top", "timestamp_created": 1689122292, "timestamp_updated": 1689122292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141661326": {"recommendationid": "141661326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154976981", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 28107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2956, "last_played": 1692299650}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing this game was a LIFE CHANGING experience for me, before Turbo Pug entered my life I was depressed, abused drugs, and was in a very dark place, but then I saw this...

For an indie game on the cheap side, what you see is what you get. Theres nothing more complex, so its pretty basic. Regardless, its a lot of fun to just screw around from time to time. If you were a fan of Neon Cat, you'll love this game. I really enjoy how simple it is. It's an endless sidescrolling runner, and the idea is simple. Just don't kill your pug. Just take them and run! There are a small variety of pugs and cats to suit your wants, and some have different abilities, such as double jump or a bit of a linger jump the way princess Peach jumps. I recommend it to anyone who wants to kill some time.

There are different pugs like the the rainbow \"LGBT rights\" pug or the Sombrero \"Don't build the wall\" pug. There are also cats too, but if you need to use them for their advantages you might as well just play as the lgbt pug anyways. There is also a pug point system used to unlock all the charcters with a certain amount of points that you obtain by running and picking up spinning pug heads. The game has no difficulty settings, so if you are bad then please consult a doctor. I recommend muting the soundtrack because its the same 3 notes over and over again so just play darude sandstorm instead. If you are a normie then learn your doggo terminology before play this game. When you are about to beat your highscore you will always die 1 point off, no matter what.\n[b]Overall rating: yes\nShould you buy the other Pug games: 10/10\nIs the game worth it: why havent you bought it yet\nDO I RECCOMEND? my answer to that is what percent off installation are you at?

I was drawn in by the design and when I saw it on sale at half price I couldn't resist. I like the concept behind the game and the art style is well done but I do have a few things I am less fond of. For me, the main problem with the game is that there is little motivation to actually play. I'm not asking for an deep storyline or anything but I think the game would be better if it actually challenged and rewarded its players. I found it upsetting that there were all these unique unlockable characters but there is no information on what you need to do to unlock them. You aren't notified when you unlock a new character and it feels like you didn't really accomplish anything to deserve them. The 'pug points' also feel useless and it would be neat if a feature was added where you could use them to buy powerups of some sort to advance further in the game. The world design is a bit bland and repetitive so traveling further doesn't really add to the experience. In my opinon these changes could make the game go from mediorce to fun and addictive. This game isn't for everyone but I would reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of pugs and wants a game to play a few short rounds of in their spare time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1472241036, "timestamp_updated": 1472241036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25134181": {"recommendationid": "25134181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121650415", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1486335433}, "language": "english", "review": "turbo pug", "timestamp_created": 1472139110, "timestamp_updated": 1594165785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25123682": {"recommendationid": "25123682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171081810", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1519349617}, "language": "english", "review": "Pug/10, best pug game ever.", "timestamp_created": 1472087673, "timestamp_updated": 1472087673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25101876": {"recommendationid": "25101876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324159332", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1471993800}, "language": "english", "review": "it's amazing. just buy it.

"language": "english", "review": "TL:DR It is a nice, cheap game but if you want quality your better off waiting for a similar game to go on sale.\n\nWhat is the game?\nIn this game you start off as a Pug and then you are placed into an endless runner, not to much more to say.\n\nWorld Design?\nThis is my main problem with the game, I wouldn't say the world design is that good.\nFirst off in your first run you have probably seen most of it and second of all it is inconsistant.\nThere are some parts where it's really easy but then you have parts that require exact timing unless you have double jump, even then sometimes you can't double jump over it because behind the obsticle if you double jump you'll fall off of the map.\nThis would be fine but there is no progression, it seems to go on until you lose, lets take Subway Surfers, it gets faster and faster the higher score you get, this might be in Turbo Pug but it isn't really visible and only having to tap space doesn't give the same thrills.\nAlso it is just kinda bland, yes there are big spikes but it isn't fun to dodge, it's sort of like an army sending one man at a time against you, it is good to get used to it but eventually it's just doing the same thing over and over until one gets lucky, it would be much more fun to send two men at me, then three ect, it would also solve the problem of progression.\n\nUnlocks.\nI don't really know what to say about the unlocks, the cosmetic changes are nice but I feel like they should seperate cosmetic changes and actual game changes.\nFor example I think the pug in a mexican hat looks cute so I go to play him, however he feels way to light so I can't play as him, if they just seperated it then you could have comfortable controls and your favourite cosmetic animal.\nThat also brings me to another point, some unlocks just feel off, the mexican pug feels way to light, the frozen pug feels to heavy, the penguin is unplayable, even my favourite (pumpkin pug) feels a tad bit to heavy.\nAlso it isn't clear how to unlock them, I think it's getting to a point where you see red vases but the game never tells me, it also doesn't tell me when I unlock something.\nHowever I do like how the added other animals if you don't like pugs but when it's a game called Turbo Pug it doesn't really make sense for non-pug fans to play.\n\nGraphics\nI don't have much to say about the graphics except that the art style is quite nice.\n\nControls\nThe space bar is to jump, probably the best button to jump, you can't do anything else.\nI wouldn't say this is a controls issue however it's related, why can't I press space to replay? Where is the logic? If I am playing an endless runner with one button atleast let me used it to start a new game instead of having to use my mouse, it's just annoying.\n\nMusic\nThe music is nice and happy, I would rather play other music as with an endless runner your not doing much so listening to music or a podcast would make it more entertaining but the music's alright...\nBut come on I don't want to listen to the same one or two songs over and over and over again.\n\nConclusion\nThis isn't really a \"game\" game more just a time killer, so as much as I think it's wrong to review it as a \"game\", it runs around screaming \"I am a game\" so I will treat it as such, I would give it a 2/10.\nSo why recomend it? Well as much as it is said I would have liked a neutral/depends button because you know you arn't going for a rich gaming expirence but for the price of \u00a30.79 (often on sale for \u00a30.39) it can kill a few hours which a movie demands \u00a35 for.\nBut if you like pugs why not pick it up when you have spare money on your steam account?\n-ShadowGamerPug", "timestamp_created": 1471506547, "timestamp_updated": 1492493767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525696098804473877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24986886": {"recommendationid": "24986886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096399146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2216, "last_played": 1524087495}, "language": "english", "review": "Good enjoyment for a hour or so", "timestamp_created": 1471499271, "timestamp_updated": 1471499271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536945998668670654", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24983750": {"recommendationid": "24983750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125683933", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1480801026}, "language": "english", "review": "Pugs are live...so this game is Turbo Life. <3 <3 <3", "timestamp_created": 1471481043, "timestamp_updated": 1471481043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502512574195861816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24983421": {"recommendationid": "24983421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189280037", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1480278539}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor juego de la historia :3", "timestamp_created": 1471479563, "timestamp_updated": 1471479563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24966340": {"recommendationid": "24966340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203261638", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1514266685}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all this game is only 1$ and and usually goes on sale to go even lower than that so theres no point in having that debate.\n\n\nThis game is suprisingly very addictive.

A\u00fan con esas, muchos jugadores se aventuran a empezar una partida en este reconocido t\u00edtulo de Pug Life debido a las numerosas recomendaciones que reciben por foros y v\u00eddeos de la cominudad. De hecho uno de los puntos fuertes del juego es la comunidad que tiene detr\u00e1s , creando contenido fan, jugando y divirti\u00e9ndose d\u00eda tras d\u00eda.\n\nEn cuanto al juego en s\u00ed mismo, puede definirse como obra maestra, la m\u00e1s alta aspiraci\u00f3n que puede tener un RPG. Una ambientaci\u00f3n inigualable y una historia INCREIBLE, que si bi\u00e9n no entiendes la primera vez que juegas por la forma en la que es contada, empiezas a descubrir poco a poco indagando en Internet y rejugando una y otra vez el juego. La jugabilidad no es descriptible con otra palabra que \"perfecta\": El combate, una vez que dominas los controles (recomiendo personalmente un mando, o en el peor de los casos utilizar alguno de los mods existentes para mejorar el teclado/rat\u00f3n) ofrece much\u00edsimas posibilidades y estilos de juego para complacer a cualquiera. Otro aspecto favorable de la jugabilidad son las cinem\u00e1ticas: \u00c9picas y solo usadas para narrar lo necesario, siendo muy importante la historia narrada en el propio gameplay. En cuanto a duraci\u00f3n, la primera vez dura aproximadamente entre 40 y 60 horas, pero la alta rejugabilidad, sumada al juego online y a los desafiantes logros por desbloquear, hacen que si te gusta puedas dedicarle m\u00e1s de 200 horas y seguir con la misma ilusi\u00f3n por continuar.\n\nPero vamos con el que es, sin duda, el aspecto m\u00e1s fuerte de Turbo Pug: La dificultad. Es innegable que Turbo Pug es un juego bastante m\u00e1s dificil que la media de juegos actuales. Pero hay algo que todo el mundo debe conocer, y es que es una dificultad sana. Me explico: Quiero decir que s\u00ed, obviamente la primera vez que juegas te parecer\u00e1 un infierno, morir\u00e1s una y otra vez en cada zona del juego si excepci\u00f3n. Avanzar ser\u00e1 una tarea agonizante de prueba y error en las primeras horas de juego. Y recalco: en las primeras horas de juego. Una vez que vayas adquiriendo experiencia de juego, vayas aprendiendo las mec\u00e1nicas y empieces a entender c\u00f3mo funcionan las cosas en este \"mundillo\", cada vez ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil avanzar (por no hablar de diversos estilos de juego que puedes adoptar y facilitan la tarea). Pero si hay otro adjetivo que defina a Turbo Pug aparte de dif\u00edcil, \u00e9ste es gratificante. Saltar un pincho tras lo que en ese momento te parecen miles y miles de intentos te da una sensaci\u00f3n enorme de realizaci\u00f3n y superaci\u00f3n que muy pocas veces sientes con otros juegos. Abreviando, la dificultad s\u00ed es elevada, pero no es nada que un jugador medio no pueda superar con algo de esmero y tiempo, y que adem\u00e1s ser\u00e1 recompensada con una gran satisfacci\u00f3n.\n\nPor supuesto que Turbo Pug tiene algunos defectos como son el a veces desesperante rendimiento de la versi\u00f3n para PC a\u00fan sin ser sus gr\u00e1ficos nada del otro mundo, o la poca actividad online que tiene actualmente debido a la antig\u00fcedad y la salida de sus sucesores Super Neo Mega Pug y Space Pug, pero son aspectos tan aislados que se ven completamente eclipsados por la radiante perfecci\u00f3n del juego en su conjunto.\n\nPara resumir, Turbo Pug es sin duda una experiencia que ning\u00fan jugador debe pasar por alto, siendo un juego que te asegura un reto y te recompensar\u00e1 con una gran ambientaci\u00f3n, historia, y por supuesto horas y horas de diversi\u00f3n.", "timestamp_created": 1466859549, "timestamp_updated": 1466859549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23781211": {"recommendationid": "23781211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129071298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1466835573}, "language": "english", "review": "The concept is a classic: you run until you crash.

Being myself, a pug loving weeb, I clicked as fast as I could on the colorful fenomena of a game. No, I didnt even bother watching the trailer because who does that these days, right?\n\n After seeing the unbearable price, I called my economical manager to sort things out. We fought for hours and hours on end until I finally managed to get the money I needed. It had taken many loans but as said love for pugs blocked my self consciousness, no questions were ever made from my side. I downloaded the game in a hurry and then played it with joy, stearing into the eyes of the helpless little pug. The pug was life, the pug was love. No one had ever given me such love and compassion as the pug did, no one, ever. Even though the pug showed love, it also brought me evil. I started hearing the pugs little bark on random equations through out my day, and after getting several mental breakdowns on my work place, the beloved friend and boss of mine had had enough. \n\nMy love for pugs had let me down, leaving me starving on a urine stained street corner in the middle of NYC. My debts were skyhigh as my of my recent pug related loans, my economical manager had also left me, in shame that is. Now I stand here on weak legs with nothing but regrets, writing this review from a strangers macbook at a local 7eleven in hopes of no one falling in the same narrow path as I once did. Please take my word.

Judging by the tags which included Indie, 2D, Casual, and Difficult, I thought it was a platformer. It certainly looked that way to me at first glance, but I was wrong. This is actually an endless runner game with platforming elements, including obstacles.\n\nRight off the bat, I had a little trouble with the game, because the full-screen option didn't work for me. When at full screen, I saw that the top half of the screen was black, and the bottom half was cut off after the play game option. I had no recourse but to play in windowed mode which created or exacerbated graphical issues.\n\nThe next hurdle I came up against was the lack of controller support. To be fair, the game is not advertised as having full or even partial controller support, but it's been my experience that a lot of games have inherent controller support, or partial support, even when that functionality is not disclosed or advertised. Now, armed with the knowledge that this was an endless runner without controller support, I launched JoyToKey, which afforded me partial controller functionality. I still had to use the mouse to click play, and there was no reliable way to exit the game except for using alt+tab to simply close the open window, but at least I could finally play the game.\n\nGraphically, I had difficulty seeing a lot of the obstacles. The day/night cycles and weather element add depth to the game but made visual distinction even more difficult. As the screen got darker, or more muddled, I could reliably see less and less on this tiny windowed screen. This is not something you want to experience in a game like this where the screen is side-scrolling quickly, and you have little reaction time.\n\nIn regard to game mechanics, there's some solid work here. Once I began to utilize JoyToKey to enable partial controller support, I could tell that the controls were consistent and responsive. If a little more care was put into graphical considerations, I wouldn't have any difficulty playing this game, and it would still be a challenge.\n\nThere's no story or purpose to this game, other than challenging yourself to get a little further than you did before, so if that's what you're after, it's best to look elsewhere. There are also no achievements. This is simply a time-killer, a casual game that can be played in short spurts. Not every game has to be a \"thinker,\" so I'm perfectly okay with that, and that fact did not diminish my rating. \n\nIn regard to level design, there wasn't anything that thrilled or impressed me, but there wasn't anything that I necessarily hated, either. There's definitely some repetition, and memory certainly plays as much if not more of a factor than skill when it comes to being successful at playing this game. While it's not something I'm likely to revisit, I can certainly appreciate it for what it is.\n\nOverall, I can recommend the game to those looking for a casual game that can be played for short periods of time and without becoming completely consuming or engrossing. I can also recommend it to folks looking for an endless runner and those who like platformers but would be willing to try an endless runner that includes platforming elements.", "timestamp_created": 1456634774, "timestamp_updated": 1468263017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702864646911621094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21491755": {"recommendationid": "21491755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093806557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1470328055}, "language": "english", "review": "No Uplay, Orgin, Or other 3rd party apps. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1456553782, "timestamp_updated": 1456553782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21484491": {"recommendationid": "21484491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044735216", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1454038178}, "language": "english", "review": "PUG GO FAST\nZOOM ZOOM", "timestamp_created": 1456524056, "timestamp_updated": 1586723570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21465700": {"recommendationid": "21465700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153460414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1456449616}, "language": "english", "review": "Rather dificult to play, not badly made I just didn't find it fun.", "timestamp_created": 1456449681, "timestamp_updated": 1456449681, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21436856": {"recommendationid": "21436856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161080094", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1489107750}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

"last_played": 1538051788}, "language": "english", "review": "Turbo Pug is a 2D, one dimensional forever runner that has you jumping over pits and spikes across a single level. You keep running forward until you fall into a pit or hit an object. This is a game that lives and dies by how addictive you are to clicking your mouse and its cheap one dollar price tag. After about five minutes in, I felt like I had seen everything. At fifteen minutes I had unlocked the twelve playable characters. Its worth a dollar, but if you're looking for something deeper than a mobile game on your computer, then look elsewhere.\n\nThe game does have a few things going for it: graphics and charm. The charm of a goofy little pug and unlockable chocolate pugs, rainbow pugs, cats, space cats and Santa hats adds a lot to a baron and starved game. The graphics have a great style and it fits that retro style. To make things more interesting, the day and night will cycle, and you'll see rain or snow happen. Its all random so it feels like the single level is dynamic and changing.\n\nThis single level throws patterns at you. One pattern has ramps and two boxes, another has two pits, there's one with a large pit and two floating boxes. Later patterns start having giant spikes and saw blades. The saw blades are dark, so seeing them at night becomes an issue. I will guess there are a mere ten or so patterns.\n\nThe control is simple; mouse click or use the space bar to jump. The space bar is less strain on your wrist, but then if you fail, you still need to use the mouse anyway to click play again. It would just be nice to have a keyboard work the menu, but why do that when you can throw a game out the door and make money? There is no support for controllers, which is never an issue, but with a game as sparse as this, its tough to think of anything to say to fluff out a review.\n\nEvery frame that you stay alive, you get a point. Then there are pug pellets for lack of a better term where then you get either fifty or one hundred points. Oh my! Puggles getting pellets getting points. Yes you is. Who's a good pug wagging his tongue while he runs? You is!\n\nWith each failure, you see your points, your high score and your overall accumulation of points. I assume the overall points unlock pugs, because the game never told me I had unlocked anything. To the game's credit, each of the playable animals does feel just a bit different. It seems like the lunar kitty has less gravity and other animals seem to run faster. Without a description of how they're different, you just need to play. I prefer the default two pugs that the game comes with to any that get unlocked.\n\nTo keep you in the game there's a leader board, but that's it. The game could have had more leader board integration such as challenge your friends or even online multiplayer where you compete on the same course. When someone loses you keep going and they drop out.\n\nAs I ran, I noticed a few glitches here and there. Nothing game breaking, but sometimes the hill terrain has a line. I've also noticed seems between the background where the background loops.\n\nTurbo Pug is a game that kept me occupied for a good ten minutes. There are better games out there that do the same thing, but Turbo Pug just looks better and has a better flavor than other forever runners.

Time your jumps.  Don't fall.  Don't touch bad.  Remember Robot Unicorn Attack?  It's kinda like that without the whimsy of customization.  Not a bad game.  It's very cute, for what it is.\n\nRedeeming Qualities:\n+PUGS!  AHMUHGOD!  DA' PUGZZZZ!\n+A nice handful of unlockable characters that have different abilities.  \n+Straight-forward gameplay.  Anyone can pick this up and play it.  Only the best button spammers (and hackers) shall master it.\n+Absolutely adorable design.\n+Also, penguins.\n+Surprisingly addictive.  You always think it's just one more go.  But, like binge-watching on Netflix, that rarely happens.\n+Unique lightning attack actually messes with the gameplay in random ways.  This can save or kill you.  But you shall never know.  (I believe in RNGesus.)\n\nCringe-worthy Notes:\n-Only two tracks. (Three if you unlock 'The Puginator') Not very memorable at that.  If you are just spending hours on this, you may wanna turn off the music and play your own.\n-Touchy controls.  Sometimes, you can hit the jump button.  You know.  THE ONE BUTTON THAT DOES ANYTHING IN THE ENTIRE GAME?!  And you'll jump.  Other times, you'll fall, crash, drown, burn, etc.  C'mon, guys.  When you make a game like this, it's mandatory that the controls are tight.  Fix dat' sheet, por favor.\n-Cats...I do not care for cats.  Why are cats in a dog game?! I'm allergic.\n\nVERDICT:\nThis game is fun, but be prepared to have brain aneurysms of frustration when the clicking/spacebar spamming fail at critical moments.  A nice little time-waster for $0.99, but an even better one for $0.49.  \n\n7.5/10 Would poop rainbows again", "timestamp_created": 1453471341, "timestamp_updated": 1453471341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20678107": {"recommendationid": "20678107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038897541", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1529981554}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is SOOOO good!

It's pretty nice, being attractive. I get to talk to the other attractive people, and I never feel like an unwanted burden to society. That can happen to the undesirables sometimes. The ones that are not as attractive.\n\n\nBut being as great as I am does indeed come with some drawbacks. Sometimes, I worry that I push people away. Being beautiful, intelligent, talented, and exceeding in all possible ways can put unwanted pressure on those beneath you. I worry sometimes that those around me might decide to just kill themselves when they realize nothing they can do will ever mean anything when compared to me.\n\n\nI mean, hey, if I was in your shoes I totally would. If I was an undesirable like you, no doubt would I be staring down the barrel of a shotgun and hoping that I'd drunk enough to not feel a thing.\n\n\nBut that's not the answer, most of the time. The world needs all kinds of people. Beauty can be perceived in a lot of ways. Some people loves huskies, for their striking appearance. Some love pitbulls, for their innate power and presence. Some even love pugs, for their charmingly disfigured appearance.\n\n\nSee where I'm getting at? Just adopt a pug or something already and maybe people would like you more. If you adopt a puppy, you can't be THAT bad. And at least the puppy will never think less of you. They don't know any better.\n\n\nIf you're in the market for pugs though, just make sure you don't accidentally get this pug.\n\n\nThis is probably the worst pug you could get. Worse than the one with distemper that's wheezing in a puddle of its own vomit and diarrhea.\n\n\nTurbo Pug is a pug-themed endless runner for the PC, available to download on Steam. At first glance, it definitely looks like Game of The Year material. But a darkness resides under its cheerful exterior. Like a distemper-ridden pug's steaming pile of mixed fluids and excrement on your loved one's bed that you covered up with a frilly throw pillow. They may not see it coming as they see it. They might smell something kind of off. But once you're in it, you're in it. And you'll wish you never had.\n\n\nThere's not much to Turbo Pug. It's an endless runner. Yeah, sure, short and simple games like that have a market. I'm not gonna knock it for being simplistic. That's kind of the genre. It's a really cheap game. Both cost and production value. It cost me pocket change. Like I'd bought lunch and threw whatever change they gave me into the trash accidentally. It really won't be missed. I'm not gonna go digging for my money back. It's just a little unfortunate. Gonna put a damper on the next 5 minutes of my life, until I forget about it and move on.\n\n\nRunners can be decent. They can pass the time in a painless and easy way. Turbo Pug does not do that. Turbo Pug is a grind. An eyesore. I'd rather stare into the sun to pass the time than play this. And that would require me to put on pants and go outside. I'd rather put on pants than play this game. If I had a rating system, that would be the lowest of low ranks, below 0. \"IGN says 0/10\" \"Kotaku says No\" \"Waffle King says Made Me Put On Pants\". That's what this game gets.\n\n\nTurbo Pug is the worst kind of endless runner. Bland, monotonous, and fails to hold your attention for longer than a minute. Reaction time between obstacles is short and brutal, meaning you're prone to dying awfully quick. Some obstacles even blend in with the surrounding background, and the screen scrolls so quick you'll often die before realizing what you hit. And it's always the same couple obstacles that'll kill you, because there's only so many in the game.\n\n\nIt's randomly generated, and yet only from playing it a handful of times I've already seen repeating areas. Like the game generates the level in chunks, and there aren't enough chunks to go around. Worse than life in gulag. Dark, cold. Chunks always spread too thin. Never enough for everyone. We starve.\n\n\nYou'll be sick of this game as soon as you boot it up. I'm not even kidding. Its stupid looping soundtrack, its stupidly simple gameplay, and its stupid art direction. You wouldn't believe how bad the art is, just from looking at screenshots. It might look good. Pixels are cute, pugs are cute. It's happy and bright, what's not to love?\n\n\nIt's nauseating to play. It hurts to stare at for longer than a minute. Trying to focus your eyes on the endlessly scrolling pixels as they race past you is headache-inducing. It's like no one play-tested this piece of shit. \n\n\nOr maybe they did, but they just swept the complaints under the rug, like pug diarrhea. \"Oh, Little Billy got eye cancer from playing this game? They're all swollen up and leaking thick, musky fluids everywhere? One of his eyes exploded, you say, and splattered the other children with mushy eye residue? Quick, get the other children to stop playing. This game is ready to ship, and we don't want their precious eyes exploding. We can sell those on the black market. Now get them back in the warehouse, if this game flops we need brand-name knockoff shoes to sell.\" is probably exactly how that conversation went.\n\n\nI like pugs. I really do. Pugs are nice. But you can't stick a pug on a stack of child corpses and call it art. It's illegal, and would get you banned from ever driving an ice cream truck ever again.\n\n\nSome people are husky people, some people are pitbull people, some people are pug people. But just adopting a pug won't make you any less undesirable. You'd still be boring, unpleasant to look at for long periods of time, and stupid. Much like this game. Adding pugs doesn't fix all of your problems. It'll just get people to notice you, maybe throw some spare change your way, and entertain the thought of you for maybe a minute. But only just. After that it's just painful and awkward.", "timestamp_created": 1452413167, "timestamp_updated": 1468210453, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456637650728225708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20437889": {"recommendationid": "20437889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116272895", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1520982089}, "language": "english", "review": "greeeeeeat!

It's also worth mentioning the ones here, practically unlocked themselves.\nFirst time i played this game, i thought it was the chests, turns out they are part of the background, I can only assume it's by collecting Pug Tokens\n\n[*]The cicle beetween  day/night and weather changes bring something different to the game, but not enough from keeping it from being repetitive\nThere are so very few hazzard patterns, this became more of a memorization game.\nAt the very least, a change of scenery is in order.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Now\u2026why is the Global leaderboard not enough?[/b]\nThe biggest problem with it, is that there is only 10 spots and half of them are practically impossible to get\nSome scores are so high, i would debate if their legit or accomplished with some exploit.\n\n[i]anyway, If you bought this game, remember to play with a controller, you dont want to sit near the screen pressing space[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1451271394, "timestamp_updated": 1451272081, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546294689178466797", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20013614": {"recommendationid": "20013614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141508808", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1453513980}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to past the time.\nFun\nLoving\nAnd\nEnjoyable\n10/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\npugs are cool pug life", "timestamp_created": 1451256798, "timestamp_updated": 1498318751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20012720": {"recommendationid": "20012720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125944022", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1512159746}, "language": "spanish", "review": "I found the game was really hard.

It reminds me of the old-fashioned Mario games, actually, except you have the added bonus of adorable animal sprites and music that's really light-hearted and funky. \n\nWhat I really like, too, is that the sprites have different running styles, so even if you get really good at using the pug, for example, you have to relearn the timing of the jumps and whatnot for when you switch to using the cat. This means you can switch it up every once in a while without getting too bored.\n\nI don't know how many hours of entertainment I'll get out of this, but it's a great game to play when I've got nothing to do and don't really have the capacity to play a game that requires much thought, like Skyrim. It's the perfect lazy day entertainment.\n\nAnd like I said - I really, really like the music. Though I have to say, the sad animal sound effects when I die are kinda heart-wrenching sometimes.\n\nMy one negative comment would be that this really starts to hurt my eyes after a while because of the speed at which you're moving, and the screen tends to blur.

You have to jump your way over gaps, water, lava, and traps to make it as far as you can until you die. The music is nice and I love all the different types of animals (cape pug is my favorite). The only real problem that I have noticed is that during weather changes and the change from night to day normally drops the FPS to about 35 FPS for a second or two. Not that big of a deal but it can be annoying when it causes you to mess up and die. Also I would suggest that the developers add some more content to the game like maybe a shop where you can spend your pug points on new characters or boosts or something like that.        \n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1449108890, "timestamp_updated": 1449108901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499975204467773438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19445191": {"recommendationid": "19445191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184107906", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1449972845}, "language": "english", "review": "i want people to play it i can say its fun and it doesnt lag on any computer which is kind of nice", "timestamp_created": 1449088486, "timestamp_updated": 1449088486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499975204467773438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19444262": {"recommendationid": "19444262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105367709", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1449403097}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 game off the year", "timestamp_created": 1449085662, "timestamp_updated": 1449085662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499975204467773438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19437953": {"recommendationid": "19437953", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982366951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1449332840}, "language": "english", "review": "I think I've never played a better game.", "timestamp_created": 1449067178, "timestamp_updated": 1449067178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525837302207946777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19437877": {"recommendationid": "19437877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261943644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1756, "last_played": 1449358571}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just pugtastic. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1449066982, "timestamp_updated": 1449066982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499975204467773438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19436160": {"recommendationid": "19436160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129072593", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1463905188}, "language": "english", "review": "1.Simple.\n2.

While I firmly believe that everyone's entitled to their opinion, I can't accept the amount of distorted, hyperbolic nonsense that\u2019s being perpetrated about this game and I find it hard to tolerate the people who have the gall to berate the game solely because of its shortcomings.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTurbo Pug is a damned good game. However, it definitely has its issues. Space Cat Studios tried new things in this title, some more ambitious than others, and not all of them were successful. \n\nIt's true that dialogue has been watered down as the devs chose to forgo text conversation choices in favor of a voiced and much more simplified dialogue wheel, which is further hampered by boring choices and weak voice work. Character advancements have been combined into a single perk/SPECIAL sheet. Settlement building, while certainly fun, is mostly aesthetic filler that has little impact on the game world. Side quests far too often amount to just killing some mandatory enemies, particularly with the Pugs (who are supposed to be the \"good guys\" of this installment), and can become repetitive.\n\nMy most prominent grievance with Turbo Pug is the dialogue overhaul and removal of the biscuit system, which was completely unnecessary and not desired by a single player in existence. Unlike the previous flaws, this thoroughly irks me. I realized that this ties in to the primary weakness of Turbo Pug: its lack of meaningful dialogue in comparison to most Space cat Studios titles. Far too often, your dialogue choices are short, shallow, meaningless, or all three. \n\nThe only choices that have any outcome are blatantly outlined as persuasion options, a lot of which only help you get some extra kibble. It's not that you should be making major decisions all the time; the problem is that you, as a speaking character, now have a voice that carries no power. What you decide to say is almost always inconsequential. The dialogue system is highly reminiscent of Bad Rats except watered down; the reason it doesn't work in Turbo Pug is that the two games have totally different approaches to conversation. The previous Space Cat Studio games had much better dialogue options because they meant something. Sometimes, your choice of words just made someone hate you, allowed you to entice or inspire others, or developed your reputation through the biscuit system. Now that biscuit is gone, your choices are just that much more pointless.\n\nThe bottom line is that Space Cat Studios sacrificed a tremendous amount of RPG dialogue elements to accommodate full voice-work. While it was an ambitious attempt, it was an all-around mistake and it sticks out like a sore if you're a fan of Space Cat Studios games or RPG's in general. The dialogue wheel system could have worked out just fine, but Space Cat Studios carried it out in the wrong way.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nAll the aforementioned flaws are some of the most central complaints naysayers have about Turbo Pug and yet not a single one of them has been horrific enough to ruin my experience or let me down. Despite the few bugs I've come across, despite the certain questionable and sometimes idiotic design choices Space Cat Studios made here, this game is still extremely well done. I still feel that incomparable thrill that only Turbo Pug can bring.\n\nEven though Turbo Pug falls extremely short on dialogue and all aspects associated with it, it's still an improvement over its predecessors in almost every other way imaginable. The game suffers some graphical issues like muddy textures and poor lighting at times, like any good Space Cat Studios game, but it's still astoundingly beautiful and even breathtaking at times. Movement, melee, gunplay, and physics are better and smoother than they've ever been. \n\nPeople were quick to judge the Pugworld map based on its size and I was prepared to be disappointed as well, but it's surprisingly the best one Space Cat Studios has whipped up thus far. The suburban locations are more organically dispersed and things become more compressed as you near the cities. Streets are narrow, buildings are tall, and locations are absolutely jam-packed alongside a ton of unmarked ruins and buildings you can enter. There are hardly any copy-pasted environments and they all show great attention to detail.\n\nI was also worried that granting access to Jowls and a Bone within the first thirty minutes of the game would be a huge balancing issue as well, but it really isn\u2019t. The jowls rely on uncommon fusion slobber goobs for power and you\u2019re not an unstoppable god while weilding the jowls, especially not at higher difficulties or levels. You can acquire some strong weapons like the Bad or Rat relatively early but finding sufficient ammo is another matter entirely.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nGta V was a simplification of the Bad Rats formula, but it was still a fantastic game. In much the same way, Turbo Pug is a simplification of the Call of Duty:Ghosts formula and is still extremely good. Even in light of its issues, this game has not been a disappointment at all. RPG elements can be enhanced through the wonderful modding community and will eventually make up for some of the game's weaker points, a perk of being a PC gamer. Space Cat Studios has, however, been on a recent trend of simplifying their games too much and I hope they change course.\n\nTruthfully, the negative Steam reviews had me partly worried that I\u2019d be disappointed but I chose to disregard them and arrive at my own opinion. I\u2019ve learned that nearly every point of contention was blown out of context. The few issues that haven\u2019t been redeemed in my eyes still pale in the face of the tremendous work that was done to bring this new and beautiful Turbo Pug world to life. I have no doubt that the naysayers worked up their expectations to heights beyond reason, and it\u2019s therefore no mystery that they hit the ground so hard afterwards. I chose to see Turbo Pug for what it is rather than what I expected or imagined it to be: a lovingly crafted game that, despite being marred by some of its shortcomings, has that same engaging splendor that far supercedes its flaws.\n\nI highly recommend you try the game and approach it with a neutral and reasonable demeanor, and you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1448341169, "timestamp_updated": 1448341169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19243136": {"recommendationid": "19243136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060319692", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1513927247}, "language": "english", "review": "I told my friend to get this for me for my birthday as a joke. \nI like it a lot.\nThis is actually top tier gaming.\n", "timestamp_created": 1448328930, "timestamp_updated": 1448328930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19242477": {"recommendationid": "19242477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152134096", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1552774435}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd rather buy assless chaps ;)\n", "timestamp_created": 1448325005, "timestamp_updated": 1448325005, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527887284755706787", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19237935": {"recommendationid": "19237935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068055594", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1448304579}, "language": "english", "review": "i say yes becuase its a fun game but there's one glitch\nthe glitch:when you pick a dog/cat click 5 times on play and you will be in the glitch\nplease fix this glitch\nand thank for making the game.", "timestamp_created": 1448304727, "timestamp_updated": 1448304727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19235581": {"recommendationid": "19235581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071824391", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1448295730}, "language": "english", "review": "Actually a lot more challenging than it looks.

There are other controls listed such as 'fire' but none of them actually exist in-game as pressing the said button for such functions dont actually have such or even any result, theres also an option to use a Controller but the controller doesnt actually work in the game\n\nThe 'leaderboards' feature is also a lie as not only is the entire leaderboard just full of '9r' scores but they arent actually online scores, its just a made up leaderboard within the game\n\nThe 'procedurally generated levels' feature is a lie too as they arent procedurally generated but rather its just several different levels that get chosen at random\n\nthe game also has a 'graphics' setting which is a lie too (not to mention wtf would you need a graphics setting on a game like this anyways), changing the graphics setting does absolutely nothing and the game was made on GM8 so ofcourse you cant change the graphics settings...\n\nIt would be nice if when you held the Jump button, that you actually continued jumping every time you landed back down but as it is; you have to keep pressing the Jump button after every time you land\n\nTheres 6 'pugs' to choose from (2 of which look like cats but hey, they must be Pugs because the game says 'choose your pug') but they arent just cosmetic changes, and are unbalanced as its just the further you go down the list of Pugs, the more times that you can do an airbourne jump, so clearly, the one at the end of the list of pugs to choose from is the best. Oh, and why is there a gay pug?\n\nTheres only 2 songs and both are mindnumbing and don't suite the pace of the game, they also both start when your Pug dies instead of when you start the session, so you end up starting to play when the song is part way through", "timestamp_created": 1447718195, "timestamp_updated": 1644163881, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434433519840240479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19121740": {"recommendationid": "19121740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079109243", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1477846647}, "language": "english", "review": "i cry when pug dies :( but still 10/10 needs more pugs to choose from though", "timestamp_created": 1447718139, "timestamp_updated": 1447718139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540816307067871094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19121623": {"recommendationid": "19121623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213012799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1457650680}, "language": "english", "review": "A very fast paced, difficult and attention needing adventure.

There are no upgrades, no unlocks (except a rabbit avatar apparetly??), no obvious goal, no real options, no modes, no anything.  You, as a pug, automatically run and manually jump past basic obstacles made with generic, if decently used, graphical assets and collect pug head icons that add to a meaningless score.  that is it.  that is literally all there is to it.\n\nIt's cute, but not worth buying, not even for 49 cents.  There are many far better games in this style that you can play completely free in your browser all over the internet.  Could've been neat for a free app to show the dev's chops for making something cute and simple maybe, at most, but selling it for any price was silly.

Definitely worth the price tag.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AhduGUOqUBc", "timestamp_created": 1447437412, "timestamp_updated": 1447437412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19055222": {"recommendationid": "19055222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211227787", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1473346050}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1447437206, "timestamp_updated": 1447437206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19055003": {"recommendationid": "19055003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068587943", "num_games_owned": 1371, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1472159883}, "language": "english", "review": "Fills the void of not being able to play Fallout 4.", "timestamp_created": 1447436526, "timestamp_updated": 1447436526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19053985": {"recommendationid": "19053985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173646899", "num_games_owned": 999, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1454104489}, "language": "english", "review": "Just the fact that the game has pugs it's worth to play it.", "timestamp_created": 1447433254, "timestamp_updated": 1447433254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19053645": {"recommendationid": "19053645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078514028", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1471642388}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No necesito mas en mi vida", "timestamp_created": 1447431957, "timestamp_updated": 1447431957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532438457012176514", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19053197": {"recommendationid": "19053197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107337417", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1455487699}, "language": "english", "review": "pug version of flappy bird", "timestamp_created": 1447430334, "timestamp_updated": 1447430334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19050022": {"recommendationid": "19050022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181661435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1591482305}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game but it", "timestamp_created": 1447417270, "timestamp_updated": 1447417270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19049931": {"recommendationid": "19049931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115644110", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1457353780}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty addictive game.

They dont have a single thing on Turbo Pug. \n\nThe beautiful textures, and scenic rolling hills are by far the best I have ever seen in any game.

I\u2019ve played twenty odd games from Mario Brothers to Super Smash Brothers. I've gotten quite good at them, too. I\u2019ve won the World Cup, the Champions League, the Premiership, the Championship, League One, Serie A, La Liga, the Bundesliga, and most importantly, the Romanian Second Division. By this point in the last game I played, I thought I was done. An assortment of minor annoyances and disappointments with Luigi's Mansion left me too frustrated to continue.\n\nIt didn\u2019t last. This year's edition, while flawed, has fixed just enough of my quibbles to draw me back in. And as ever, Turbo Pug remains a fairytale generator. It\u2019s perfectly possible to arrive at a struggling landscape with a grand history, implement innovative new tactics, and take your pug back to the top. It's just easy enough that you can do it, but just hard enough that you\u2019re never quite certain you can. It\u2019s balanced on a beautiful knife edge, and its greatest achievement is selling you the fantasy of sitting in the pug owner's chair.\nThe pugs on display this year are distinctly modern too, with a degree of fluidity and position swapping that feels authentic to today\u2019s dog world. The fact that striker-less tactics (something real world pug owners have been dabbling with for years) have now finally found their way into the game\u2019s preset formations shows a willingness to keep up with the times. If Luigi's Mansion felt oddly retro, Turbo Pug is cutting-edge.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that all my problems with Turbo Pug have gone away. I still think the game has a serious problem with bloat. People play Turbo Pug for a lot of reasons, and I\u2019ve been aggressively reminded in the past that those who desire a \"realistic\" simulation actively enjoy the incredibly slow scouting and endless questions from the media. It\u2019s not a position I can agree with, though. I find these time-sinks an irritating barrier to playing the runs, and as a result, Turbo Pug and I have been drifting apart for a while.\n\nThankfully, three years ago its creators at Space Cat Studios acknowledged this split in the fanbase by introducing Classic Mode, which has now been confusingly rebranded to Turbo Pug 2: Simple Edition, even though it plays just fine with a mouse and keyboard. It offers a stripped-down, fluid approach to play. It was a godsend, offering a version of the game that focused on what I felt was important.\n\nThe user interface, which in older iterations looked little better than colored spreadsheets, has become slick and intuitive.\nTurbo Pug typically comes with an army of borderline-inconsequential tweaks that together deliver a noticeable difference overall but individually are difficult to rave about. There are, however, several new features here that had a meaningful impact. Let's start with the new multi-pug feature, which is a perfect example of the series\u2019 penchant for incremental improvement working well. For years now I\u2019ve been mildly irritated by the fact that I can only have one pug, regardless of whether I wanted to have more than one pug. Now, with the click of a couple buttons, this problem is solved, and I can have many pugs to frolic the fields with.\n\nThen there\u2019s Create a Pug mode. As far back as I can remember, Turbo Pug fans have used game editors to add their unique pugs to the game. There\u2019s a whole culture of forums full of different pug designs like these. Now Space Cat Studios has acknowledged this strange social aspect of the game, and offers players the chance to create a pug in a far more accessible way.\n\nI\u2019m also strangely entranced by the option to create an on pitch avatar for your pug, letting him yell and scream at his pug friends from the sidelines. They all look absolutely terrible, but there\u2019s something strangely endearing about them too. For the record, yes, you can select either male or female pugs.\nYet at the same time, I have to acknowledge that the \"full\" mode of Turbo Pug is still very much not for me. Many of this year\u2019s new features involve expanded media interactions, a part of the game that hasn\u2019t worked well for a long time. I still get dog lovers interrupting me to voice their concerns that we don\u2019t have enough dog treats, despite the fact that I\u2019m not planning on feeding my pugs. I\u2019m told I can dismiss their concerns assertively, cautiously, calmly, or passionately; unfortunately, I\u2019m not really sure what the difference is.\n\nInterestingly, Space Cat Studios has said it plans to sell a standalone version of Turbo Pug 2: Simple Edition, with a release date of \"sometime before Christmas.\" If you\u2019re the same kind of Turbo Pug player as me, you may be better off waiting for that. For now, you can find Turbo Pug 2: Simple Edition here in Steam. Many of the new features--the Pug Creator, Create a Dog Treat and a lightly tweaked tactics UI--are available in Simple Edition while almost everything I dislike has been cut. This, coupled with the fact that the match engine feels just a little bit more German Shepherd than Jack Russel this year, was enough to draw me back in.\n\nShoutouts: Sean, mom, papa john", "timestamp_created": 1447288312, "timestamp_updated": 1447288578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657176494598388672", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19023477": {"recommendationid": "19023477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157038523", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 166, "last_played": 1646442954}, "language": "english", "review": "loved it. it was cheaper then dirt and there is nothing wrong with it.\n\n\n\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1447286396, "timestamp_updated": 1447286396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19022730": {"recommendationid": "19022730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180703271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1465150923}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best 99 cents you will ever spend in your life\n11/10 Pugerific!", "timestamp_created": 1447283243, "timestamp_updated": 1447283243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463576167821884155", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19022617": {"recommendationid": "19022617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062101490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1448072859}, "language": "english", "review": " i bought this game expecting only pugs, but i was greeted with not only pugs, but cats as well. im happy.", "timestamp_created": 1447282832, "timestamp_updated": 1447282832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19022515": {"recommendationid": "19022515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015240200", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1495502531}, "language": "english", "review": "Best pug face squish simulator out there.", "timestamp_created": 1447282453, "timestamp_updated": 1447282453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19022051": {"recommendationid": "19022051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046217866", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1492349193}, "language": "english", "review": "its just amazing", "timestamp_created": 1447280671, "timestamp_updated": 1447280671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19021985": {"recommendationid": "19021985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028665926", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1616121743}, "language": "english", "review": "Felucia would be proud.", "timestamp_created": 1447280444, "timestamp_updated": 1447280444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19021790": {"recommendationid": "19021790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009485246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 327, "last_played": 1498583518}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very simple, very cute. \nIt has pugs, dressed up pugs and something that resembles cats?
