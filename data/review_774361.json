Released in 2019, this 2D side-scrolling game has garnered attention for its challenging gameplay, haunting visuals, and a narrative steeped in themes of redemption and penance.\n\nOne of the standout features of Blasphemous is its intricate and atmospheric world design. The game unfolds in the nightmarish land of Cvstodia, a place cursed by grotesque creatures and plagued by the echoes of a mysterious, divine calamity. The pixel art is stunning, bringing to life the twisted landscapes, eerie dungeons, and grotesque enemies in a way that is both horrifying and captivating. The attention to detail in the art contributes significantly to the overall immersion, making each area a visual feast for players willing to explore the unsettling depths of Cvstodia.\n\nThe gameplay is equally compelling, combining precise combat mechanics with challenging platforming elements. Players take control of The Penitent One, a silent and stoic protagonist on a quest for redemption in a world brimming with macabre adversaries. The combat system is punishing but rewarding, encouraging players to learn enemy patterns and master the use of a variety of weapons and special abilities. The level of difficulty may be a deterrent for some, but for those seeking a true test of skill, Blasphemous delivers an experience that is as unforgiving as the world it portrays.\n\nThe narrative is presented through cryptic environmental storytelling, religious symbolism, and haunting NPC interactions. The lore is deep and mysterious, with a narrative that unfolds gradually as players progress through the punishing landscapes. The themes of guilt, redemption, and atonement are woven into the fabric of the game, adding emotional weight to the dark journey of The Penitent One.\n\nWhile the game has received praise for its atmospheric design and challenging gameplay, some players may find the difficulty level to be a double-edged sword. The unforgiving nature of the combat can be frustrating for those not accustomed to demanding experiences, potentially limiting the game's appeal to a specific audience.\n\nIn conclusion, Blasphemous is a masterclass in atmospheric design and challenging gameplay, offering a haunting journey through a nightmarish world. The combination of pixel-perfect art, punishing combat, and a deep narrative make it a standout title for fans of dark and atmospheric action-platformers. However, its high difficulty may be a barrier for some players, making it more suitable for those who relish a challenging and immersive gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1700748275, "timestamp_updated": 1700748275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151306778": {"recommendationid": "151306778", "author": {"steamid": "76561199174691041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1606, "last_played": 1689081537}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly a very good game. my biggest critique of the game is that a lot of the requirements of certain quests are sporadic and so complicated that I couldn't understand what i was supposed to in certain areas, but other than that, the bosses are challenging and the gameplay is quite addicting once you get ahold of your footing", "timestamp_created": 1700742177, "timestamp_updated": 1700742177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151303458": {"recommendationid": "151303458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022699246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 701, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1700782393}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Rezos y ostias consagradas.\n\n El juego combina elementos de los g\u00e9neros metroidvania y soulslike, ofreciendo un mundo abierto y no lineal, un combate desafiante y una narrativa enigm\u00e1tica. \n\nEl juego es tan dif\u00edcil que te har\u00e1 blasfemar m\u00e1s que rezar, y te har\u00e1 sentir culpable por cada paso que das.

Este juego ha sido elogiado por la cr\u00edtica y los jugadores por su ambiente aterrador y su estilo de juego desafiante. A continuaci\u00f3n, se presentan algunos aspectos destacados del juego:\n\n- **Arte y est\u00e9tica**: Blasphemous cuenta con un arte impresionante en forma de pixel, que le confiere un aspecto retro, pero con animaciones detalladas que se asemejan a las modernas. El juego tiene una atm\u00f3sfera sombr\u00eda y melanc\u00f3lica que recuerda a los cl\u00e1sicos Castlevania, con un ambiente lleno de sangre y sadismo[5].\n\n- **Historia y personajes**: La trama se centra en un personaje conocido como The Penitent One, quien se encuentra rodeado de un mont\u00f3n de cad\u00e1veres con cascos similares en la parte superior de los restos humanos. La historia es narrada a trav\u00e9s de instrucciones riddle-like entregadas por un personaje llamado Deogracias, quien es el testigo del \"Milagro Grievioso\"[5].\n\n- **Juego**: Blasphemous es un juego de 2D Metroidvania con un estilo de juego no lineal. Los jugadores pueden explorar diferentes \u00e1reas de manera no lineal y encontrar varios puntos de control \"Prie-Dieus\" en el estilo de Dark Souls. El combate es desafiante y requiere de evasiones frecuentes y parrias bien timadas[5].\n\n- **Dificultad**: El juego es conocido por su dificultad, lo que puede resultar en una experiencia de juego que puede resultar en frustraci\u00f3n para algunos jugadores. Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n ha sido elogiado por su capacidad de crear una atm\u00f3sfera aterradora y desafiante[5].\n\nEn resumen, Blasphemous es un videojuego que se destaca por su arte impresionante, su ambiente aterrador y su estilo de juego desafiante.

The boss battles are a balance between challenge and fairness. The difficulty seems a bit lower compared to other games in this genre. \nBlasphemous has a unique storytelling approach. It invites the player to piece together the lore and history of Cvstodia through item descriptions and talking to NPCs. What makes Blasphemous truly stand out is its sheer brutality. The game embraces a visceral and bloody aesthetic. The concept of Pain is central to the experience, creating a world that is both disturbing and oddly satisfying.

From the hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack to the meticulously crafted environments, every aspect of this game is a testament to the developers' commitment to delivering a truly unforgettable experience.\n\nThe combat in Blasphemous is nothing short of brutal, demanding precise timing and strategic thinking. Each swing of your weapon feels weighty and satisfying, and every encounter with the grotesque foes is a test of skill and patience. The game's punishing difficulty may not be for everyone, but for those seeking a true test of their gaming prowess, Blasphemous delivers in spades.\n\nThe narrative is as dark and cryptic as the pixelated landscapes you traverse, drawing you deeper into a macabre lore filled with religious symbolism and grim folklore. The interconnected world is a joy to explore, filled with secrets, challenging platforming sections, and horrifyingly imaginative enemies.\n\nWhile the difficulty may be a barrier for some, the sense of accomplishment that comes with conquering each challenging area is incredibly rewarding. Blasphemous is a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling, punishing gameplay, and pixel artistry that will leave a lasting impression on anyone daring enough to delve into its nightmarish depths.

DS2 had a novel twist on this, which I am not going to explain what this was, as it would alleviate required research, but it was reversed with the bonfire pumpkin. That novel addition made the game at least playable and the grinding was rewarded. I'm not sure if such a mechanic exists in \"BS\" but no information was given, its not going to get found out. \n\nThe same attribute on death also applies to the little sliver of theft to the players \"MP\" bar. I dont know if BS calls it something else, if it did it was forgettable, so its the \"MP\" bar.  Why? why tf does the game have to steal this asset from me when the player dies due to bad gameplay and level concepts? I did not agree to this. it feels so cheap when the game stoops so low to ideas attempted and done and tried before.

"language": "english", "review": "If I had to pick two words to describe this game, they would be [b] clunky [/b] and [b] inconsistent [/b].  \n  \nWhen comparing this game to other metroidvanias, it's fairly mediocre if not on the lower end, Clunky combat, inconsistent hitboxes, long runbacks due to platforming fails because of the inconsistent hitboxes, and overall a lack of respect for the player's time. There is a lot of platforming, but Blasphemous sucks the fun out of what's normally one of the most fun parts of these games; the slightest error results in instant death and a long runback, and oftentimes that \"error\" is you phasing through a platform, falling right past a grabbable ledge, hitting an invisible spike hitbox, falling through a ladder that you pressed the button to interact with, etc.\n\nAnd the hitboxes? Forget them corresponding in any way to your character sprite or those of the enemies. There are some instance where this works in the player's favor with an attack harmlessly slicing right through you, but generally it just leaves you thinking \"how the hell did that hit me?\" And that's not to mention that the hitstun on everything has no rhyme or reason. Some sources of damage (particularly with respect to platforming) will give you a long stun if you're grounded when hit and none if you're airborne when hit, some have hitstun that can be cancelled by crouching, and others will always knock you back a seemingly random distance each time. The thing is, there's no consistency to it.\n\nI completed the game (endings A and B) and did all the blue rose challenges, and, quite honestly, I regret putting the time into this game.\n\nIf you haven't played Hollow Knight, you'd be much better off playing it than playing this. If you have played Hollow Knight and enjoyed it, you probably won't have much patience for this game's pitfalls.

like the motif and the level design as well as the souls genre, the actual gameplay is rather poorly implemented. the combat mechanics are very stiff and wooden and worst of all unreliable. i often find myself wondering where i am, where i should be, and what i need to do. the dodge mechanic doesnt work most of the time and the enemies hurt you when they touch you independent of if they are attacking or not which makes me wonder why they even attack in the first place? idk ive played dead cells and hardpoint and souls games and this one is almost good, but there is something missing. perhaps a few things missing. it seems like if they were making an RPG character as the game they spent all of thier stat points on art and acting and none into combat. its alright for the like 2$ i spent on it. disappointing though i wanted to really get into it.", "timestamp_created": 1699599946, "timestamp_updated": 1699599946, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

This didn't happen that often in the earlier segments but in the latter half of the game it becomes a common occurrence. So common in fact that I felt I had to completely give up on the game. At a certain point when a games difficulty comes not from challenge but from being hard for the sake of being hard it's no longer fun.", "timestamp_created": 1699470580, "timestamp_updated": 1699470580, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546079754829406738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149770187": {"recommendationid": "149770187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285881252", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2511, "last_played": 1699450798}, "language": "spanish", "review": "8/10", "timestamp_created": 1699466912, "timestamp_updated": 1699466912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149768378": {"recommendationid": "149768378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198818818565", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2001, "last_played": 1674723243}, "language": "english", "review": "Bro just parry", "timestamp_created": 1699464627, "timestamp_updated": 1699464627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504909992218017578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149764048": {"recommendationid": "149764048", "author": {"steamid": "76561199164976866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1204, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1699893702}, "language": "english", "review": "I love art , song theme , combat style", "timestamp_created": 1699458989, "timestamp_updated": 1699458989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149761343": {"recommendationid": "149761343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814248095", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 150, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1700375717}, "language": "english", "review": "I had skill issue :(", "timestamp_created": 1699455478, "timestamp_updated": 1699455478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149758019": {"recommendationid": "149758019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246330898", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 302, "playtime_at_review": 750, "last_played": 1700496129}, "language": "english", "review": "Makes me want to learn Latin", "timestamp_created": 1699450948, "timestamp_updated": 1699450948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690892219543457031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149751555": {"recommendationid": "149751555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132001036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1248, "last_played": 1699482182}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid metroid with fair difficulty (except a couple of spikes for a boss or two) and a very clear design intent.

No, this game has issues and people are most likely ignoring them because thats what people do with something they like, make excuses for its shortcomings.\n\nI know its a different game, but I never had an issue accepting death or damage in Hades. Every time I failed a run I could see that I wasnt good enough in something. There was almost always a way I could escape damage, I just had to be better.\nHere its the opposite. Almost every time I take damage I feel the game is cheating. I either cant move the way I want, the enemies are positioned in a way as to not let me handle them properly, trial and error gameplay and if you manage to put yourself in the wrong position you will get hurt a lot or even die. The times I did do well against the enemies I felt I was cheesing the game. Waiting near ledges to pick one off, waiting until other enemies go outside the screen.\n\nIve played games on hard difficulties before and hard games in other genres, so I can tell when the game is hard because I need to do more/better or when its designed to be vexing through artificial means.

For every great decision made in regards to atmosphere, there's a complete miss gameplay-wise.\n\nPresentation? One of the greatest in gaming history. It's the main thing this game has going for it. The atmosphere is incredible. Switching to the Spanish dub is highly recommended. Sprites look great, stages are varied and beautiful too, animations are CRISP as hell.\n\nThe lore is very interesting but probably too sparse to fully dissect in a single playthrough. There are multiple endings, so replaying the game is encouraged.\n\nGameplay-wise? Very hit or miss. Combat feels punchy and impactful but basic at times, even after multiple upgrades. Platforming is not bad, just irregular. Some elements, like ladders, are very unreliable and sometimes lead to instant deaths by spikes. It's especially annoying when the game has time-based sections that are not exactly easy.\n\nWorld design is GREAT. There are shortcuts and hidden passages everywhere. Going back to Albero through an elevator after 3 hours of struggle is awesome.\n\nBosses in general are decent. They're good enough, and very memorable visually. Some are annoying but nothing too bad.\n\nLevel design is good when traversing and exploring, but it has one fatal flaw: The worst aspect of Blasphemous in my opinion. Enemy placement. Some sections are very tolerable. Not easy, but manageable with some thought. Other sections took a page out of Dark Souls 2 and decided to throw around a f*ckton of enemies for no reason other than padding an already decently long game.\n\nIt's pretty good! It just feels like it needed a bit more thought put into combat to reach that extra quality. I still highly recommend it for the atmosphere alone.\n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1698788860, "timestamp_updated": 1698863352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149272937": {"recommendationid": "149272937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392814874", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2335, "last_played": 1672853928}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1698783720, "timestamp_updated": 1698783720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149270465": {"recommendationid": "149270465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026185849", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2237, "last_played": 1698947074}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game in just about every way.\nThere are some optional platforming challanges that have some bad insta-kill hitboxes, and you can miss the good ending for an entire playthrough, but other than that it's a 8/10 for me.", "timestamp_created": 1698780864, "timestamp_updated": 1698780864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149252040": {"recommendationid": "149252040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198892427973", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1851, "last_played": 1699647432}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta es la jornada cotidiana que tenemos en Espa\u00f1a", "timestamp_created": 1698760346, "timestamp_updated": 1698760346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149230800": {"recommendationid": "149230800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198929307095", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1488, "last_played": 1698722229}, "language": "english", "review": "this game makes me want to cut my dick off and to hang myself by my balls to slowly bleed out", "timestamp_created": 1698722302, "timestamp_updated": 1698722302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149222803": {"recommendationid": "149222803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165195579", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 638, "last_played": 1699133323}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and challenging.", "timestamp_created": 1698708826, "timestamp_updated": 1698708826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149204536": {"recommendationid": "149204536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044011964", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 663, "last_played": 1686163949}, "language": "english", "review": "This game hits different.

"review": "I have around 20 h in this game( 1 save file with 98% completion.)\nI cannot recommend this game.It is...abnormaly frustrating.\n-It is to to slow for a metroidvania, also it gets annoying having to always grab the edge of a platform then just being able to jump on it (as a side note, I find it funny that you can stand on the blood platforms but can't grab onto them)\n-has a very simple combat system (which I know can be expanded but for 95% of the game you'll just be using the standard moveset ) which gets boring very quickly\n-health and fevor upgrades are few and far between\n- two of the most profitable quests require a guide to properly complete\n-relics(I only have a complaint about one relics and its the one from the 3-headed creature,like, no casual player would have figured out how to progress their questline without looking up a guide and it is also one of,if not,the most essential relic when exploring cuz a lot of bone part,sword hearts and prayers require it)\n-enemies either have infinite hyperarmour or none at all, some enemies  literaly cannot be ignored bc you MUST kill them to pregress further(looking at you humanoid statues in the ice area), the flying wizards can be knocked out of bound but they can still attack making the early game(when you don't have the holy blood throwable) very frustrating\n-hit boxes are fine for the most part except for the nuns with the giant bell weapons\n-OST's are solid ,nothing catchy but fitting\n-early and mid game bosses are fun to fight but the late game ones are just frustrating(I am refering to the bell dude on the bridge ,the fire dude in the prison area,the last two bosses of the base game and the Gravetender lady where the bone collector is )\n       -my main complaint about them is that it is near never clear when exactly the attack is going to happen due to the \n        animations being badly telegraphed and you will most certainly mistake one attack animation for another (take \n       a look at hollow knights attack animation and how very well telegraphed they are)\n-fast travel locations are few and far between which wouldn't be a problem wasn't the games mobility so slugish\n-prayer are either situational , underwelming, or down right busted like the one that creates two circling balls around you and the one that negates ALL DAMAGE for a couple seconds\n-the fevor(mana) bar fills up far to slowly(it almost feels like they didnt want you to use it to begin with)\n-no i-frames when after getting knocked down by an attack resulting in an easy stunlock\n-having to waste a rosary slot just to be able to see the enemies health\n-the jumping animation can feel incredibly slow for the fast humanoid bosses\n-there are maybe one or two openings when you can safely heal up \n-healing animation is to slow\n-i dislike the concept of having to sacrifice some of your currency AND heath to give yourself a chunk of fevor(which is pretty small if you want to use stronger prayers)\n-the game is very unclear what you are supposed to do after entering the Mother of mothers\n-sword hearts give mediocre buffs but give insane debuffs\n\nThese are all the things I can think of at the moment, wasn't really invested in the story but the visuals we stunning\n\nNow,I don't want to make the game seem like it was made by the miracle(ha,get it) but ,taking into accountablilt everything  I have listed here, I really can't recommend this game to the faint hearted, more casual players \nfor that I would rather recommend hollow knight",

I applaud when a game builds its mythos so creatively from source material that you don\u2019t see very often. With Blasphemous, the result is a universe that feels beautifully disturbing and unique.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all: Blasphemous is full of Spanish (and more specifically Andalusian) flavor to a degree that makes me incredibly proud, as someone who has been living in this country for two decades. It\u2019s not every day that you see a game translating so masterfully the soul of the studio\u2019s region into a fantasy setting. From iconic architecture of Islamic origins to mystical visuals from Catholic rites, any small detail can be the seed for a dreadful creature or an awe-inducing region within the game\u2019s Cvstodia.\n\nYes, Blasphemous is an incredibly fun game for those who can appreciate a good action-platformer with Metroidvania elements.

Pero dejando de lado todo eso, considero que este juego es grandioso, por much\u00edsimos motivos, el primero ser\u00eda su estilo gr\u00e1fico, ese arte de bits me parece incre\u00edble, el como logra que los sprites, a pesar de ser bi-dimensionales aparenten lo contrario es algo que no se ve con todos los juegos que comparten su estilo, en segundo punto tenemos la historia y ambientaci\u00f3n de mundo, ya que a mi lo que m\u00e1s me llama de un juego es su arte, pero a veces, la historia tambi\u00e9n forma parte de lo que me atrapa y me vuelve adicto a cierto t\u00edtulo, dar\u00e9 un peque\u00f1o resumen luego, otro de los aspectos que destacar\u00eda del juego es su sistema de progresi\u00f3n, el mapa tiene un buen n\u00famero de habitaciones que tienen como objetivo aumentar las estad\u00edsticas de tu arsenal (tu espada, barra de vida y dem\u00e1s), otro aspecto son los enemigos y jefes, la mayor\u00eda no tienen dise\u00f1os gen\u00e9ricos, y muchos de ellos toman inspiraci\u00f3n en antiguas leyendas de la cultura cat\u00f3lica europea, la que me lleva a hablar de los escenarios, tambi\u00e9n fuertemente inspirados de ella algunos puentes, catedrales y habitaciones espec\u00edficas est\u00e1n llenas de estas inspiraciones, la m\u00fasica, compuesta por Carlos Viola, le da vida a cada escenario que el protagonista pisa, en mi experiencia personal, no es tediosa, al contrario, se llegan a volver pegadizas y son bastante disfrutables, que le dan su sello al juego y suman puntos a la ambientaci\u00f3n m\u00edstica-medieval que rodea a este mundo ficticio, \u00e9l \u00faltimo punto que quiero mencionar por sobre otros es su re-jugabilidad, dividida en : sus distintas dificultades y modos que permiten variar la experiencia de juego, y sus DLC, que para mi sorpresa, son totalmente gratuitos, no a\u00f1aden mucho, pero si lo suficiente como para extender un par de horas su duraci\u00f3n. Ahora pasando a la otra cara de la moneda, la de aspectos negativos, tengo solo 2 que mencionar, el primero ser\u00eda la escasa o nula pista de que hacer en el juego, ya que la introducci\u00f3n es literal como cualquier juego de la saga souls, inicias te dan tu arma y a pelear contra un jefe, adem\u00e1s, luego te permiten abrir tu inventario y ves que hay un mont\u00f3n de cosas que no te ense\u00f1an como funcionan, pero gracias a las gu\u00edas de Youtube, puedes solucionar cualquier duda que tengas, y el otro, ser\u00eda la complejidad de que hacer con algunos de los objetos que vas consiguiendo, porque algunos son de vital importancia para avanzar, y el juego no da ni la m\u00e1s m\u00ednima pista sobre como/donde usarlos, lo cual puede causar estancamientos al buscar donde usar X item que conseguiste en Y lugar. Ahora, esta historia se desarrolla en una basta y larga tierra llamada Custodia, la cual est\u00e1 sometida a los caprichos del Dios de ese mundo llamado \"El milagro\" que se manifiesta de variadas formas, en su mayor\u00eda negativas para los habitantes de la zona, encarnamos al \u00faltimo miembro de \"La hermandad del lamento mudo\" nuestro nombre es El penitente, y como cualquier otro habitante, sufrimos la manifestaci\u00f3n del milagro con nuestra penitencia, la cual es el silencio (peculiar forma para hacer que el protagonista no hable), el prop\u00f3sito de este ser\u00e1 cargar con las penitencias de todos los dem\u00e1s pueblerinos de Custodia, enfrentandose a mortales peligros y humillaciones con tal de conseguirlo, pero, lo har\u00e1? esa es una sorpresa que no quiero arruinarte, averigualo por ti mismo,  esta aventura vale la pena.", "timestamp_created": 1698287903, "timestamp_updated": 1698287903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148879454": {"recommendationid": "148879454", "author": {"steamid": "76561199113530623", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1698652637}, "language": "english", "review": "I find myself just running past most basic mobs due to them needing to be parried over and over till they die.

En conclusion, con ataques continuos puedes hacer izzi pizzi a Isidora, Sierpes e incluso al Hijo ultimo del milagro.\n-Debla de las luces, Quieres deletear un jefe o hacerle 30% de da\u00f1o de una sola plegaria al instante? esto es lo que buscas.\nDuracion - 9 El juego dura lo suficiente para no fastidiarte ni tampoco dejarte con ganas de mas.\nExploracion y mapa - 10 Bastante extenso y variado, digno de un verdadero Metroidvania\nDesafios - Sinceramente solo me tope con 2 cosas que creo fueron las mas tediosas de todo el juego.\nLa quest del caliz de los versos invertidos y los desafios de los espejos Strife & Ruin, en comparativa el caliz es de dificultad media y su recompensa muy alta en cambio los Strife & Ruin son tediosos solamente pero su recomenza al final de los 5 es la pobreza misma.\nDificultad DLC - 6 Sinceramente incluso sin usar plegarias las primeras 4 amanecidas te llevara 2 o 3 intentos a lo mucho, algunas incluso hasta en el primer intento podrias derrotarlas. El panorama de las amanecidas esta muy bueno pero la dificultad deja mucho que desear, Esperaba que Laudes (5ta amanecida) Tuviera una pelea en 2 o 3 fases asumiendo asi la posicion de jefe definitivo de todo Blasphemous pero....No.\nSolo es una pelea en segmentos, cada cierta cantidad de da\u00f1o cambian sus patrones de ataque un poco pero en esencia sigue a ras de lo sencillo.\nA diferencia de Resident evil 7, Blasphemous es un juego que disfrutas al estarlo platinando y comenzar una nueva run ya que en cada nueva partida tienes la posibilidad de obtener de 8 a 20 trofeos.\nMenciono a Resident evil 7 por que cada nueva partida del juego es un verdadero calvario que te obliga a pasar por lo mismo al menos durante 5 partidas nuevas para lograr obtener el platino.\nEn conclusion: Comprate Blasphemous y juegalo por cuenta propia, cuando le tomes cari\u00f1o te daras cuenta de que todo lo que leiste en este post es lo mas justo a una rese\u00f1a.", "timestamp_created":

As\u00ed que venga va una revi\u00fa pa' el blasfemias vamono.\n\nLo primero que hay que destacar de Blasphemous es que si eres de Espa\u00f1a, la sensaci\u00f3n de familiaridad con la iconograf\u00eda, la arquitectura y la tem\u00e1tica general de Semana Santa presente a lo largo de todas las \u00e1reas del juego es brutal. Y bueno, ya si eres de Sevilla me imagino que dicha sensaci\u00f3n se multiplica por mil, no?\n\nNunca jam\u00e1s de los jamases juego con voces en espa\u00f1ol, pero al escuchar un poco el di\u00e1logo en ingl\u00e9s me qued\u00f3 bastante claro que la experiencia definitiva ten\u00eda que ser, inevitablemente, con las voces en espa\u00f1ol. Y que grata sorpresa me llev\u00e9 al escuchar el incre\u00edble trabajo de los dobladores espa\u00f1oles. Mi mand\u00edbula se desplom\u00f3 hasta el suelo cuando escuch\u00e9 al primer NPC con acento andaluz, verdaderamente lo nunca antes visto para mi.\n\nY en cuanto a lo que se refiere a gameplay,  hay que decir que es un juego muy bien dise\u00f1ado. Por supuesto, como todo buen metroidvania, hay que leerlo todo y prestar atenci\u00f3n a lo que dicen los personajes para no perderse despu\u00e9s, pero en general la progresi\u00f3n es intuitiva y explorar todos los rincones del mapa resulta satisfactorio.

I don't find much in this game to be very similar to souls other than corpse runs. Which you're not required to do, as theres other ways to retrieve your 'corpse', and you also don't lose currency, and if you die before retrieving your 'corpse' the previous one doesnt go away.\n\nWhen you die you drop a 'guilt knot' which decreases your MP cap, and makes you receive less currency until you retrieve your guilt knot. Eventually you will find places you can pray for a currency fee to reclaim all guilt knots if you dont want to go retrieve them.\n\nSouls-like also seems to be tied to difficult games, and I didn't find this game to be any harder than some other metroidvanias, combat is pretty straight forwards and most bosses are pretty straight forward with their moveset and mechanics.

It's never particularly complicated or difficult at length (you rarely get stuck) and some people might want deeper combat, but the rich art and generous parry system means you're always seeing something new (gorgeous and/or upsetting to gaze upon) and moving at a steady clip. \n\nI'd recommend looking up a guide for Ending C since it's easy to miss, by the way.", "timestamp_created": 1697408074, "timestamp_updated": 1697408074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148301779": {"recommendationid": "148301779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316229451", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 749, "last_played": 1697521129}, "language": "english", "review": "This game BANGS!!!!!!!!!

Quite the peculiar gaming experience, if I do say so myself.\n\nAs I dove headfirst into this pixelated penance, I couldn't help but marvel at the intricate detail of the leather outfits, the compelling use of chains, and the artful application of punishment so vividly displayed. The character's passionate cries of pain (or was it pleasure?) reverberated through my speakers, instilling a tangible connection to their plight.\n\nNavigating through dark dungeons, I marveled at the impressive lengths these developers went to make the experience as immersive as possible. The masterfully executed whips, the constrictive outfits, and the methodically placed torture devices were almost too realistic. My hands shook (from excitement, surely?) as I carefully guided our masked protagonist through their tumultuous journey of salvation and suffering.\n\nThe detailed animations were simply stunning\u2014how every wince, every shudder of pain was so vividly captured on screen. However, I did find it slightly odd when the characters began to engage in activities that seemed... somewhat inappropriate for a Steam game. The whipping scenes were incredibly realistic, and the anguish on the faces of the penitent was palpable.\n\nAs the torturous journey unfolded before my eyes, I became increasingly perplexed by the lack of actual gameplay. I mean, where were the boss fights? The power-ups? The platforming challenges that I'd heard so much about?\n\nIt was at this moment, dear reader, that a dawning realization clawed at my consciousness: My in-depth exploration into the dark, painful recesses of the Penitent One's journey was, in actuality, a very different type of exploration entirely.\n\nIn my fervor to experience the acclaimed Blasphemous, I had mistakenly indulged in a completely unrelated BSDM video, venturing into a realm of penance that Steam certainly does not endorse.\n\nSo, while I cannot in good faith provide a review of Blasphemous, the pixelated world of sorrow and salvation, I can affirmatively say that if you\u2019re into a different type of interactive, stimulating experience, there are certainly videos available for you.\n\nAnd as for Blasphemous... well, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a hell of a good time. \n", "timestamp_created": 1697392909, "timestamp_updated": 1697392909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

A pretty solid game with amazing art and great music. There are a decent number of bugs I ran into, but almost none of them were serious (mostly graphical bugs and a couple funny stuff). \n\nThe gameplay is serviceable and fun, but not really innovative (not that I minded, I love simple and classicish games). Wasn't the hugest fan of the physics but got used to em. The map became tedious to traverse after a while. Many enemies were hit sponges but as the game progressed this became much less of an issue. \n\nI don't usually like RPGs, so I was glad there wasn't some kind of traditional exp system in place, more of a classic style metroid game with some light level up elements. I found a lot of the leveling up stuff for upgrades to be extremely cost prohibitive. Like Dark Souls, the exp and money are the same thing. There were expensive keys, expensive interchangeable upgrades, expensive flask upgrades, etc. Basically to get 100% of everything it felt like it would take a lot of mindless grinding and I'm just not interested in that at all\n\nThere was no metroid-like required backtracking with upgrades to reach new areas. I didn't mind it, some people might not like that.\n\nLots of annoying instadeath pits, many of them offscreen so be sure to look down before jumping.\n\nThe combat was fun, but at times felt a bit stiff. That's probably something they wanted, more akin to dark souls. But the time you're locked into doing special attacks was too high, I found blindly slashing at stuff was the most effective way to win. Which is a shame, because I was hoping the upgrades would be more fun. The dodge sometimes went to the opposite direction of where I meant, which was incredibly annoying.\n\nThe upgrades you do get are usually pretty tame and boring. There's a ton of different upgrade types and it was all pretty confusing which one was which. For instance, when I picked up an item I was always confused if it was a basic collectible, an inventory item, a rosary upgrade choice, a sword core, a major latent upgrade etc. I managed to beat the game with only one latent upgrade to help me through a certain environment, there were more apparently but somehow I missed them. There's a system in place kinda like hollow knight where you pick some modifiers, and even a special move. But none of them made the game feel significantly different. The upgrades you get by levelling are also all extremly basic and cost prohibitive for no good reason.\n\nI felt like the bosses and enemies were mostly a bit tough, but usually fair. A lot of people said this game was really hard but I didn't find it especially difficult, I struggled more on DKC2 which I recently played through.\n\nI really enjoyed when I got pretty good at the game and totally destroyed the toughest boss quickly. Was very satisfying finally figuring out how to maximize the damage.\n\nI didn't really understand the story, and all the dialogue was incomprehensible to me. Much like Dark Souls! haha. Anyways, I might look up a youtube video on it later or something, but I didn't feel the need to know the story to have fun with it.\n\nThere's definitely a bunch of things in this that are total bullshit. But all great platformers have at least some bullshit, so don't let it deter you from trying it\n\nAnyways, I would say definitely give this is a shot if you think it might be interesting. It's pretty solid and fun, and the graphics/music are great too. But don't expect another Hollow Knight or something. I would probably get this on a sale or something tbh\n\nI heard Blasphemous 2 was much better, so I'm excited to give that a shot sometime :)", "timestamp_created": 1697264392, "timestamp_updated": 1697264392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148177443": {"recommendationid": "148177443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326304245", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1484, "last_played": 1697256083}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game for those who enjoy their metroidvania and souls-likes.

I even see fps, and 3rd person games with \"metroidvania\" slapped on, they aren't even 2-d let alone have no ability gating.  Metroidvanias have 4 key components. enjoyable, fun movement, a world that beckons you to explore, abilities needing to be discovered to explore and open the world up further a.k.a ability gating, and a story that mystifies you making your lust for exploration burn vigorously. some would argue good combat/ bosses are key too, and I agree, however, it is not as important as those four. Metroidvanias are like mini epics where you go on some great explorative adventure starting out weak with little movement/abilities, and become something awesome as you progress, whilst you learn about your localle, why you're there, who you are possibly, why the events are taking place in the game, how did you end up here. These are all questions the player should be asking, and as they recieve answers, those should lead them into more questions and leave them scratching their heads. All that said, I think this game so far meets all these requirements but ability gating. In conclusion, the game is not bad, however, it should not be considered a metroidvania.

Elevated by deeply engaging thematic content. \n\nDespite what an initial look (and the title) might suggest, I would say this is only partially about religion. Far more substantively I believe this is a game concerned with the way we conceptualize pain. Most specifically the virtue of pain, expressed here through the lens of holiness, but more widely applicable in what we find beneficial pain culturally. The idea that someone must be punished with pain or suffering for their wrongdoings, whether it would be best to relieve someone of their pain or if it would be more virtuous to let it continue.\n\nReligion mostly occurs here to convey the idea of a standing dogma that idolizes pain. The language of religion here is partly exaggerated to convey an extreme reverence for pain. Partly though, it is indicative of the idea that religion is often the lens used to justify what pain is good pain and what pain is not. In that way, I think this game has a lot to say about religion. It would be, however, quite short sighted to limit this critique of pain being a means of virtue, when the same narratives are so prevalent in general cultural understandings.\n\nI mean to say this game doesn't merely say \"look at these antiquated religious zealots\" and go \"religion bad,\" the bigger ideas say that suffering is an ugly thing, and relegating the blind worship of suffering to being antiquated practice would only be a way to put off examination of our own ideas about pain and how we feel about the pain of others.\n\nPretty wild game though, this one is extremely deep.

It's a lot of fun seeing an artstyle that brings elements of Spanish, and specifically Andalusian concepts into a dark fantasy setting. The Spanish dub is out of this fucking world. The quests are as convoluted as in a Souls game, you'll have to look at a guide for some of them if you want the 100%, but they're very rewarding. The combat is good, simple in its mechanics but with a lot of depth between different playstyles, specifically with spells (Prayers).\nMost of the issues I have with this game is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It's absolutely not a metroidvania, while you have many branching paths, you don't unlock new areas based on new abilities, but only on story progression. The abilities are used only for unlocking secrets. Even though it's not a metroidvania, exploration is key to the game. This is why it pains me so much that there are so many instakill mechanics, specifically pitfalls and spikes. Having pitfalls kill you outright takes so much out of the exploration, at least until you get the item that makes you \"immune\" to them (which is required for some secrets). While traversing the map, I dropped to a zone that was DIRECTLY BELOW the area I was in, there was even a ladder leading down, but you either go down the ladder, or instantly die. Like Ninja Gaiden on the NES. Spikes are a little less frustrating, they just kill you and make you stay overly alert when you just want to go from point A to point B.\nTo end on a positive note, the game has received 3 updates in the form of DLC that have modified the base game a lot as well. First of all, the added and already mentioned Spanish dub. Then, lots of secondary content, like the Bloodstained crossover, the 8-bit arcade game, and obviously the new areas added by the DLC. Third, but most importantly, the new ending is amazing. It fits very well with the world, despite it being a lot more hopeful than what the other endings were. Unlocking it, as you may have guessed, is very convoluted, but the feeling of actually coming to a breakthrough and changing the story as you knew it has made my latest playthrough a lot more enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, this game is an indie gem, as a spaniard, I'm proud of it, and you should buy it. Then play 2, it fixes most of this one's issues and follows from the new ending.", "timestamp_created": 1697045142, "timestamp_updated": 1697045142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148021425": {"recommendationid": "148021425", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976726350", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3305, "last_played": 1698917660}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall fun game play.

Finished it after 18 hours with 87% of the content completed, got Ending B (blind playtrough).\n\nThe idea of using this old spanish catholic theme for game of this genre its just amazing, specially when the devs have no fear of showing gore or crude themes, it really is amazing. The atmosphere of the levels, the pixel art, the music, its all top notch.\n\nThe bosses are just a piece of amazing work one after the other, from the visual design, to the lore they imply and surprisingly... the mechanics, no boss is a copy of another, they all have different mechanics you need to pay attention to. Some are big enough to engulf the whole screen, others use the level/environment for an advantage, others summon minions to help em and others are just a normal sized character like you. They really feel like a piece of art.\n\nThe puzzles are varied and actual puzzles you need to figure out how to approach em, tho sometimes can be hard due to the lack of clues. For example, to open certain closed door you needed to use the lever of an elevator 5 times in a row and i literally have no idea from were that came from, i ended up looking at the wiki because there was no dialogue, hint, number on the walls, picture, anything that hints that.\n\nNow the gameplay, i know nothing of metroidvania games and how they are supposed to be, so im gonna give my opinion on this from a souls perspective: the dashing sucks, simple as that.\n\nThe parry is good tho you can't use it on like half the bosses or enemies, which i understand since the game forces you to jump around, duck OR dash.... and thats the problem, the game itself tells you the dash has invulnerability frames and it does not feel like that at all. While i do understand that you can't spam it (one dash after another) and there's even dedicated items in the game to help you with that, the i-frames on the dash are either super tiny or they just don't work on some enemies. Plus the response from when you press the button to when it gets executed on the screen is long enough to go to the kitchen and make myself a cup of coffee... well, not that long, but after playing a souls game i think you can understand what i mean.\n\nBut oh well, those few cons are not even close to deprive you from enjoying and finishing the game, so give it a try.\n\nI give it a solid 9/10, may the Miracle... keep you? guard you?... not turn you into an abomination? anyways, have a good one sinners.", "timestamp_created": 1696580694, "timestamp_updated": 1700637321, "voted_up": true,

playing this through when I was out of commission for a few days.  \n\nOn the positive - \nThe artwork here is absolutely gorgeous, and the bosses are equally interesting and fun.  I didn't know exactly what I was getting into when I first loaded it up, and quickly realized the game expects you to put some effort into beating it.  It's on the harder end of the spectrum, but the combat is very fun and rewarding.  The enemy variety is tremendous - there's always a new enemy to encounter and nothing gets stale.  The theme and presentation are consistent and immersive.\n\nOn the negative - \nI got a little frustrated towards the end-game where a couple sections took me more tries more than I'd have liked, and one of the game's main ways of making things more difficult is by making you complete longer and longer sections between save locations.  Towards the end I forgot where something was on the pretty sizable map and I kinda knew what I needed to do, but wasn't completely sure.  The game does very little to guide you or tell you where to go or what to do.  You're also probably not going to just stumble on to the \"true\" ending unless you look it up.\n\nOverall - \nGames are meant to be fun.  This game is fun, and beautiful.

Combat is fun and rewarding, art is is fantastic, and the overall vibe of the game is well crafted. All (or at least most) the enemies in this game are so cool looking that every time I get to a new area that's the thing I'm excited to see most. On top of that all the boss fights are fun, unique enough, and also look really cool. The game is definitely more on the difficult end of the spectrum, but not so difficult that its unbeatable by the average gamer, though you might die a lot. \n\n[b]The eh:[/b]\nThe story is told in the typical fromsoft fashion where you're reading item descriptions to piece together what's going on. This can be hit or miss for some people. I don't necessarily mind it, but I'm not always in the mood to go lore hunting, especially if I don't know that it'll be worth it. For this game I mostly skipped on it, and let some random youtuber tell me what happened. I do regret that however, because the story is pretty sick. For the sequel I'll definitely do this on my own. Outside of the main story, the game adds some side quests that have you meeting some interesting npcs that result in some pretty memorable interactions.\n\n[b]The not so good:[/b]\nThe platforming is the weakest part of the game without a doubt. Its just not tight enough for what the game demands of you in some places. Specifically with regards to blind jumps and instant death spike pits placed throughout the game, the platforming can result in some pretty annoying deaths, resulting in you trudging all the way back from your last checkpoint only to try again. This leads into the other minor gripe I had which was the backtracking. Now I understand this comes with the genre, but I think due to the overall difficulty, backtracking becomes much more painful in this game. Between, having to traverse through some of the not so good platforming sections and pretty much unavoidable enemies in some locations, it can really mean that it might take almost as much time as it did the first time around to backtrack through an area to get to a new location or something. You'll be stronger and have more health for sure, but that doesn't mean much if you fall into a spike pit trying to jump onto a finicky ladder.\n\n[b]In the end[/b] the game is absolutely worth playing despite its flaws.", "timestamp_created": 1696529813, "timestamp_updated": 1696529813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147692563": {"recommendationid": "147692563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198431021438", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2439, "last_played": 1696524852}, "language": "english", "review": "gg", "timestamp_created": 1696524888, "timestamp_updated": 1696524888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147684695": {"recommendationid": "147684695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016901761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2502, "last_played": 1696541237}, "language": "spanish", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1696516244, "timestamp_updated": 1696516244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147679302": {"recommendationid": "147679302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156541775", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1588, "last_played": 1696510357}, "language": "english", "review": "Game was good overall.

Still, with death pits around, you can't really go fast and have to stay careful, which becomes a slog in the last 10-15% of the game.\n- Metroidvania traversal powers locked behind convoluted \"trade in\" and \"equip this to proceed\" quests\n- True ending locked behind convoluted quest where you have to go everywhere in the map to talk to NPCs at specific times.\n\nThe last 10-15% of the game left a sour taste in my mouth.

Do you like Dark Souls? Do you like Hollow Knight? Do you like the old Castlevania games? Heck, even if you liked Super Metroid, then you'll like this. I could spend a million paragraphs critiquing it, but this is the concise way to sell it. Nasty \"Souls-like\" 2D Metroidvania, with more of a focus on exploring an open-ended world, instead of the more common Metroid style progression of using power-ups to open new areas. The concept and world-building centres around a Medieval Spanish Catholicism gone Cosmic Horror setting that's very vague but no less hugely atmospheric and interesting. \n\nThe combat is weighty and heavily focused on timing and patterns and planning how to engage an enemy ahead of time, rather than say, the free form, weightless improvisation of something like Hollow Knight. The platforming action and level design panders to classic Nintendo shtick along the lines of Ghosts & Goblins, punishing albeit not as downright antisocial as its forebears. The boss fights are always a laugh, frantic and oppressive, challenging but never truly too much to overcome. The entire world is crammed with cryptic, arcane side quests to complete hidden objectives, I ended up having to use a guide for some parts, but your mileage may vary.\n\nThe whole package is fun. It's subtly silly, it's often frustrating and overwhelming and bewildering, but it's ultimately rewarding and really makes you feel like you've overcome a real challenge.

Of course there are many games you could call similar to souls games, such as Hollow Knight, but that game didn't necessarily contain the spirit of a souls game. Many games take the functional part of those games, without also considering the narrative or artistic style that From Software has achieved during the making of the souls series.  This is what blasphemous does.  Game mechanics wise, it's a competent, smooth 2D metroidvania with sparse checkpoints, perilous platforming and out of this world artistic  style.  But what it incorporates that truly make this game an achievement, is a comprehensive and thought provoking narrative about blind faith.  This pairs up with the art style really nicely to create a brute, unforgiving world where your goal is to do something of meaning.  Whatever ending you choose, in this game, what really matters is the fact that you did it and reached the end.  The confusing story makes it difficult to understand if you had any impact in the world, but that's irrelevant.  You gain purpose because you went through the game.  That I think i the heart of souls narratives, and this game does it better than any 2D metroidvania I've seen (yes, including Hollow Knight).  However, the game play left too much to be desired. It didn't pair up as well as other metroidvanias do with their story.  There is of course a narrative reason for everything that you have at your disposal, but what didn't pair up well is a really important part of these type of games: character growth.  This game has  a leveling system, but it didn't feel as satisfying to actually get to the end in 2 ways:\n\n1. A game like Hollow Knight makes you feel much more powerful if you find specific items in the game, since it almost always means an upgrade.  But specifically, it constantly mixes gameplay styles you can choose from.  Blasphemous has only 1 weapon, and that's it. It has lots of spells, but it takes too long to use one of them, and their effects are not all that different at the end.\n\n2. Typical souls games made by From Software pair up the upgrade system with character growth. A great example of this is Elden Ring, where you feel a bigger sense of achievement because you get materials needed to perform an upgrade.\n\nOf course, Blasphemous is like neither of these games.  It's a 15-20ish hour game which doesn't need such complicated mechanics. The problem is though, that those mechanics are essentially just wishes that were left by me when I finished the game.  I wanted more.  But Blasphemous didn't show that much gameplay. It being short was not a problem, mind you, but the big problem is that the game could have become much braver when it came to the part of conceptually designing gameplay mechanics.  It kind of is already, there are for example many death pits in this game which would confuse and frustrate players, but they were done carefully such as to never be as annoying as platforming sections in Castlevania games.  The real problem for me though, was that it didn't do enough of these things: The gameplay lacked the variety and beautiful color to truly represent the narrative of this game.  Therefore, it's easier for you to struggle understanding why this  this game is entertaining you. I did, but that's only because I came into this game knowing it was going to be a 2d souls game. \n\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a beautiful, well built game which will likely be very fun for most that play.  However it's arcane narrative may be lost to some players not because they hadn't tried to get the feel of it, but due to the game not having gameplay complex enough to warrant people reading, or caring enough to explore it more.  The thing that truly sets this game apart though is that it successfully reinvents in my opinion the most important aspect of a souls game (narrative-visual-gameplay loop) into a 2D metroidvania. So overall, it was a really great time for me.\n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1696154176, "timestamp_updated": 1696154327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147416636": {"recommendationid": "147416636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128559081", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1294, "last_played": 1696146173}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good soulslike.", "timestamp_created": 1696147681, "timestamp_updated": 1696147681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147416279": {"recommendationid": "147416279", "author": {"steamid": "76561199025152476", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1092, "last_played": 1696389155}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1] Ave Mar\u00eda, dame punter\u00eda [/h1]\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28bf\u287b\u285d\u287d\u28dd\u286f\u28ff\u287f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u289f\u28af\u28b3\u2895\u2897\u28dd\u289e\u28ae\u287a\u28d5\u289f\u287d\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2871\u289d\u289c\u288e\u2897\u28dd\u28ae\u286b\u2873\u28dd\u28ae\u28b3\u2879\u28d5\u289f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2878\u28a8\u288a\u280a\u2808\u2873\u2879\u28ea\u28ae\u286b\u28ce\u2887\u2821\u2891\u28b5\u2831\u2871\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28aa\u286a\u286a\u2873\u284d\u28ae\u28ba\u28b8\u289c\u28dc\u289c\u28b5\u28b5\u289d\u28ae\u28aa\u284e\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ef\u28aa\u28aa\u28aa\u286a\u2873\u2811\u2811\u281c\u289d\u28ae\u286a\u286b\u284e\u28f7\u28ff\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28e3\u28a3\u286b\u2862\u2888\u2808\u2884\u28aa\u28b3\u289d\u28b5\u28fd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u280b\u28bc\u2872\u2879\u2878\u2870\u28ac\u28b0\u28b1\u28b9\u284c\u285b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u283f\u281f\u288b\u2809\u2820\u2808\u28b8\u28ff\u28dc\u28dd\u28ae\u286b\u286e\u28f3\u28fd\u2847\u2804\u2804\u2888\u2829\u281b\u283f\u28bf\u28ff\n\u2804\u280c\u2810\u2804\u2802\u2801\u2840\u2802\u28ff\u28ff\u28fe\u28ea\u28eb\u28fe\u28bf\u28fb\u2804\u2802\u2810\u2880\u2810\u2808\u2804\u2821\u2804\n\u2804\u280c\u2840\u2821\u2808\u2880\u2804\u2804\u28b9\u28ff\u28ff\u282b\u288c\u28bb\u28ff\u284f\u2840\u2808\u2840\u2802\u2820\u2801\u280c\u2820\u2801\n\u2804\u2802\u2840\u2802\u2848\u2880\u2804\u2882\u2828\u28ff\u28d7\u2867\u2822\u28ee\u28fb\u2801\u2804\u2820\u2810\u2808\u2840\u2821\u2804\u2805\u2848\nEl juego esta bien god, literalmente te hace decir [b] HDSPM llamen a Dios[/b], ademas tiene toda una biblia de lore, literalmente.

Almost too easy. but man oh man does the difficulty level get hard fast. It takes skill, timing, strategy, and a little luck sometimes. The game play and controls are very smooth and responsive especially once you understand the controls.\n\nOne thing to note. The default keybindings (mouse & keyboard) are the absolutely worse I have ever seen in a game. I can't think of a dumber way to set the default control scheme. Why the Devs chose this is beyond me. The good thing is you can remap all the controls in options. There are lots of reddi post, steam threads, and other sites with tons of ppl asking for help in re-mapping the keybindings. (seriously the Devs have the worse intuition in assigning keybindings/controls). \nIn order to get to the options menu, you have to open the map first and press \"O\". I never would have guessed this, and why the Devs didn't just go with the \"press Esc key\" to get to the main menu is ridiculous. \n\nok, so end of negative rant about keybindings. Once I changed all the keybindings my game play is seamless and fun. \nThe story is very dark, and I hope the makers of this game can sell the movie or TV rights, because this IP would make a fantastic movie/ series. The voice acting is top notch, and the writing is sooo good. If you love the darker elements of someone like Clive Barker (Hellraiser, Lord of Illusion, Book of Blood, nightbreed etc.)  you will love this story setting. \n\nFor such a simple looking game it is really a pleasant find.

I had high hopes for the game, especially considering the themes it was going to tackle: religion piety, dedication, mystery, striving for greatness. But after spending 15 hours of play on this game, I just could not bring myself to finish it.\nI'll start off with the good - graphics look amazing, and each boss is an artwork deserving of presentation in a church or a monastery as an icon. The map is rich and full of secrets. The enemy variety is enough for its purposes.\nThat leads to my criticisms: the gameplay is way too simple. Yes, you can unlock many different attacks, spells, upgrades, but for the most part the game consists of Dodge, Spam attack, Dodge, Spam attack, sometimes use Spell etc.. And to be honest, that might've been enough for a recommendation, but the story (or lack there of) is what snuffed out my interest completely.\nI was hoping some sort of integration of game mechanics and story themes, where the symbolism, the metaphor is intertwined with the gameplay, but the gameplay and the story seemed to begrudgingly shake hands when absolutely required. The only mechanic I can think of that had any sort of symbolism behind it was 'cutting' yourself to open a locked gate, and then there was no use for it. (I am aware that you can cut yourself to fill your Mana/Penance, but you can easily ignore that).\nHonestly, at that point in the game I felt like the developers (who have done a great job of making this game) made a good, but a bit standard, metroidvania, and then chose the setting of near-catholic world, where sin is manifested in real world. And even then, just as so many other storytellers before, came up with the idea of making the church/gods/saints the bad guys/corrupt.\n\nTLDR: a good, if not standard, metroidvania with a fine gameplay loop, but the story-mechanic dissonance kills all interest", "timestamp_created": 1696057846, "timestamp_updated": 1696057846, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515165865421295166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147332028": {"recommendationid": "147332028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403982407", "num_games_owned": 1020, "num_reviews": 182, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1614806676}, "language": "english", "review": "2D bloodborne", "timestamp_created": 1696052892, "timestamp_updated": 1696052892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147329569": {"recommendationid": "147329569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126262997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1287, "last_played": 1696447728}, "language": "english", "review": "Game made me Catholic, Dominus Vobiscum / 10", "timestamp_created": 1696049296, "timestamp_updated": 1696049296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147325780": {"recommendationid": "147325780", "author": {"steamid": "76561199410528839", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1678301679}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Joya 100/10, el perrito es el mejor personaje del juego, necesito tocar una mujer.", "timestamp_created": 1696044054, "timestamp_updated": 1696044054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147312825": {"recommendationid": "147312825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054891702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 478, "last_played": 1696088698}, "language": "english", "review": "Anything that's related to platforming or backtracking in this game is downright [u]horrible[/u].

The grimy and visceral visions of grimdark catholicism is, beyond the cyclopean richness of Warhammer 40k, pretty much an underused setting. Everywhere we go we are bombarded by gnarled roots and roses, twisted gothic architecture with an overdose of skulls, death, spikes, and holy symbols. On top of that we have a gameplay revolving around the meticulous collection of various anatomical features of dead geezers and crones, prayer beads and suffering to increase our everlasting torment.  \n\nThe story takes place in Cvstodia, the epitome of Catholicism gone haywire where we play as the last of a fraternal fellowship of coneheaded penitents sworn to silence. On our quest to topple the chosen one of the miracles we encounter fellow blasphemers, saints, sufferers and dogs. Honestly this game reeks of atmosphere and I guess the artwork and setting is somewhat of an acquired taste. If you find blood, gore and weird pseudo christian symbolism a bit too much, you might want to pick another game.. \n\nAt \u00edts core Blasphemous is a classic Metroidvania, albeit a rather cryptic one. The nonlinearity of the maps are spot on and to traverse the twisted landscapes we need to gather relics to alleviate our mortal forms limitations. Sometimes I found this to be a bit too cryptic, almost to a fault. However the gameplay in large is hugely satisfying and combined with the lovely worldbuilding I would say that this is a fantastic game! The boss fights are a mixed bag, I loved some of them, others were, well, way too harsh or way blander than expected.. All in all the gameplay is a slightly worse Hollow Knight, take it or leave it..   \n\nIn the end I highly recommend Blasphemous to anyone into great Metroidvanias. This is an instant classic and I really love when a game dares to not include an obvious double jump in the list of potential upgrades.. Enjoy it for the handcrafted images if nothing else, I never thought i'd be this intrigued by reinvented Catholic liturgy. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1696019334, "timestamp_updated": 1696019334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700064182281494141", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147306174": {"recommendationid": "147306174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294744762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 68, "playtime_at_review": 2008, "last_played": 1699684478}, "language": "english", "review": "Gracias por hacer unos de mis favoritos juegos en mi collection", "timestamp_created": 1696019087, "timestamp_updated": 1696019087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147303747": {"recommendationid": "147303747", "author": {"steamid": "76561199226680455", "num_games_owned": 653, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1694795886}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Blasphemous cautiva con su est\u00e9tica pixelada exquisita y su atmosfera sombr\u00eda.

There's no denying I was addicted to this game during my first play through. I couldn't put the controller down as I wanted to continue to progress through this 2D metroidvania. Most of the game seemed pretty linear in terms of the progression. The story was compelling and, as the protagonist, you wanted to learn more about this world you were immersed in. The combat is simple to pick up and mobs are not egregious. Save locations are placed fairly distant from one another, giving a fair challenge. Variety in buffs allow some semblance of choice within the game as well. \nThe longer I played however, was when the flaws started to peak out. This became especially apparent with NG+.\n\nFrom a completionist stand point, there are achievements that are completely miss-able, which includes the 100% achievement. There are absolutely no indication within the dialogue of NPCs to guide players for certain key items (such as the item for double jump or the wall climbing vine) that halt progression (if I am incorrect with this, I accept the possibility that I may just be an idiot). There were instances where mini bosses, who are in there own rooms, would bug out after parrying (this can be extremely frustrating having to backtrack back to the boss and any semblance of progress is loss. Not to mention these mini bosses can be tough, forcing you to replay the instance several times over). DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON SOME OF THE PARRYING. Call me a bad gamer but I don't know what estranged Spanish saint I have to pray to but Christ theirs some bosses that are absolutely broken. It all just feels some what...clunky? \n\nLong story short: Not as good as Hollow Knight.

The moment to moment gameplay feels great, navigating the world, uncovering its secrets, and fighting bosses is intensely satisfying, with the religious imagery of Spanish Roman Catholicism tying it together. \n\nA couple poor design decisions mar the experience. There's a fair amount of platforming in the game, all of which features spikes and endless pits that insta-kill the player. This results in a death screen, load screen, and then walking back to the platforming section to try again. This very easily could have been replaced with a quick respawn and some health lost. This is especially apparent in one of the DLC quests with Castlevania crossovers. Being a veteran platformer player, I enjoyed these lengthy speedrun challenges, but they definitely felt out of place. \n\nThe second issue is more deep-seated. Several points in the game lock you out of content and bosses. In order to see everything Blasphemous has to offer, you must do atleast 2 playthroughs. Normally, this would be no issue, but the length of Blasphemous and the nature of its unlockables left me with a sour taste upon seeing this. There are a few other quests that have hidden triggers for progression, which will lock you out of happy endings and Achievements if you are interested in that. \n\nI didn't have it in me to do a second playthrough of Blasphemous, but for those up for it, it offers plenty of new content, story, secrets, and unlockables. The continued support in the form of small DLC packages helped make Blasphemous into a more complete experience. \n", "timestamp_created": 1695502646, "timestamp_updated": 1695502646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146886991": {"recommendationid": "146886991", "author": {"steamid": "76561199310421053", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2092, "last_played": 1695501405}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Putee este juego pa sacarme los logros y me enoje bastante le pegue a mi abuela le pegue a mi hijo me divorcie queme mi casa vivo debajo de un puente ahora y debo pension a un bastardo culiao k no es mio recomendado 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1695502205, "timestamp_updated": 1695502205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146881370": {"recommendationid": "146881370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129307241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1339, "last_played": 1694965512}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego con un pixel art preciosos.

game pays homage to, I've played Souls games, but this is beyond frustrating, especially considering that a LOT of the areas are just for collecting stupid quest items that pile up for God knows what, while I'm sitting with 5k points waiting for when the game allows me to get more upgrades for my sword, thinking I might have missed something, meanwhile it takes 10 hits to kill the first enemy in the game, and hours later when I'm in the boss fight with the 3 ghost ladies who throw spears at you, and I'm just done. \n\nAlso want to add that, and I'm just reading, but -SPOILER- there is a secret ending, for which you absolutely must read a walkthrough, otherwise you will miss it, because it asks you to play in a very deliberate and stupid way, and no other Metroidvania or Soulslike has ever made you do this kind of shit. \n\nI love the aesthetics, the music, but as a metroidvania, nah, this aint all that.", "timestamp_created": 1695361183, "timestamp_updated": 1695361305,

It hand its frustrating moments at times but once you get past the initial few hours of the game it really opens up and starts to get kinda fun. Fast forward to about 13 hours later I'm close to the final area, I've done most of the collectible hunting, and I look up what you need to do to get it and... this is where i uninstall. In order to get the true ending and even step foot in the DLC area you needed to not fight one of the very first bosses in the game before visiting a certain area or else your screwed. Let me repeat that, you literally miss out on a whole area and a secret ending because you were playing the game as you thought you were supposed to. I'm not even going to finish the game new, all that effort wasted because of a incredibly idiotic mechanic. And no,  im not going to NG+ just for a 10 second cut scene.

After exploring and poking and smacking around, getting tons of very holy items and equipping myself with everything extremely holy and sacrosanct until I felt extremely saintly with a sword, I managed to delve further into the sins of the inhabitants and remove that said sin with the help of mea culpa and a little bit of force. The creativity of this game and the obvious catholic inspiration is so much fun to explore, everything from visuals to sound and music to the lore.\n\nHowever, it is a very difficult game, that does get a little bit easier down the road when you get used to it, explore and find power-ups and equip yourself with some of the items you'll find. Still hard despite that, and you better get good with the controllers and enroll in a plat-former boot-camp to improve your reaction time. \n\nIn short, it's a game made by sadists, for masochists.\n\n[h3]Some Good Points[/h3]\n\n[b]Music[/b] - Love it, beautiful iberian themed music, you can feel the Inquisition around the corner.\n[b]Sound[/b] - I actually find it well put together - it feels right most of the SFX effects and work with the overall theme.\n[b]2D graphic design[/b] - Absolutely fantastic I loved every inch of the game world's graphical design and all the characters as well!\n[b]Content[/b] - absolutely enough for the price-tag, for sure. Some of it is good, some is better and some of it should've been thrown into a dumpster fire while in concept stage of their design ... imho (see below)\n[b]Difficulty[/b] - It is very difficult and very much so in the beginning until you gradually learn how to play the game and avoid some dangers, handle the controls and how to deal with some enemies. I can say for sure I'm not the best platformer player, and I struggle with some bosses so I won't be able to beat some of them without flasks, for now. I don't know how many times I've died (least hundreds of times for sure) in the game and how many times I simply quit the game in the mid of it and had to do something positive to counterbalance the frustration.\n[b]Creativity[/b] - I'd say it is exceptional, it is so fun to take it all in visually and audio-visually the whole game, the story is absurd as well but the fun part is that people really were nuts back then when it came to the whole sin-concept going into overdrive in Catholicism (especially).\n\n[h3]Some Less Good Points[/h3]\n\n[b]Quest Design[/b] - Really convoluted and obscure. I ending up checking a guide because I got stuck and it took too much time to keep running around and around not understanding the triggers of some of the quests, and yes I was right they were really convoluted.\n\n[b]Glitches & Bugs[/b] - There are some moments albeit very rare the player char is stuck for some reason or can't dodge (end-game areas), thought my controller was bad but no it was an in-game glitch. There are also icons not displaying properly in the map, particularly the blood fountain in the second last area.\n\n[b]Genre Content[/b] The Strife & Ruin content is something I'm not happy about since it is a type of a genre that I don't like playing, it wasn't what i wanted when I bought the game but it isn't game breaking to skip it, however it annoys the hell out of me since it locks me out from getting a full completion of the game. If I want to elevate my stress levels and enjoy masochism then I work double-shift while being screamed at, then play Meatboy while blindfolded and have my bare feet pressed on sharp glass shards while playing a recording with someone hating you non-stop on 150% volume after work, and no food or water. \nNot sit through another 2-3 hours TRYING to get the two last pieces by clearing the death-trap courses within given time. I hope it isn't in the sequel, seriously I pray to the Miracle it isn't, otherwise I'll skip buying it.\n\n= = = = = =\n\n[h2]Summary[/h2]\n\nBuy it without a doubt, but be mentally prepared, have a sturdy controller of at least Nokia quality and an anger-management tool ready beside you and be ready to accept you'll have to skip content so you don't lose sanity.\n\nGame made by the Inquisition on steroids - I give this game 38 out of 38 Cherubs \n(except Strife & Ruin, it can go F itself [b]\"%&\"#&/#&!![/b])", "timestamp_created": 1695287115, "timestamp_updated": 1695301472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146687906": {"recommendationid": "146687906", "author": {"steamid": "76561199351959768", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 2260, "last_played": 1700749243}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es una carta de amor a los juegos", "timestamp_created": 1695270746, "timestamp_updated": 1695270746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146685247": {"recommendationid": "146685247", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999157408", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3451, "last_played": 1695430138}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1695266530, "timestamp_updated": 1695266530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146684385": {"recommendationid": "146684385", "author": {"steamid": "76561199468096187", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1698386058}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing artstyle challenging platforming as well", "timestamp_created": 1695265168, "timestamp_updated": 1695265168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146683803": {"recommendationid": "146683803", "author": {"steamid": "76561199149875067", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2826, "last_played": 1694900841}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sexo morboso", "timestamp_created": 1695264238, "timestamp_updated": 1695264238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146680460": {"recommendationid": "146680460", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990813920", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1695258959}, "language": "english", "review": "Previous review was maybe too harsh.

I typically find enemies in games more annoying than fun, so the fact that Blasphemous made me enjoy fighting and learning them is a huge plus. (Though some enemies were really annoying to fight)\nThere were 3 bosses I really liked, 2 I thought were good, and then the rest were kinda forgettable/mid (Final boss kinda sucks). This was the highlight of the game, though even with the bosses I thought were really good I felt like I was put into situations I just couldn't dodge. But for the most part I really liked the difficulty.\n\nI really wasn't a fan of the exploration of the game. I went 15 hours not finding a single ability, just waiting to find the one ability that clearly every single path was locked behind, just for it to be locked behind some weird convoluted quest I had to be told how to do AFTER I already beat the game. Making the majority of the game just feel like I was just mapping out dead ends with no real reward the entire game. Because I was locked out of most of the map until after finishing the game and had to look up every single ability, everything just felt like some clean up fetch quest that just took all the fun out of the metroidvania exploration for me, that eventually I just gave up trying to find most of the stuff because it was basically meaningless at that point. The map is also really big and most areas just felt kinda pointless to fight your way through because bosses were so spread out and you rarely find something useful.\n\nUnlike most metroidvania's the abilities are also not anything the player can actually use like a movement ability or something, they just spawn platforms and walls, or just immunity to some hazard so you can go through an area. Basically just keys to a door with lack of player interaction. Which makes it especially confusing as to why you can only have 3 equipped at a time? Just made it so when I saw something I could interact with I had to go into the menu and change what I was wearing for that room to interact with it. \n\nSpikes and pits killing you instantly (which you usually fall into because you just walked into a room or they're off screen) are extremely annoying and made exploration especially tedious at some points. \n\nFast travel in the game is very tedious with how spread out it is. You do get an upgrade for this hidden behind some random donation that doesn't tell you what it does or how much it takes, or even how much you've put in. This is where the most important upgrades in the game are hidden behind. \n\nThere are many side quests you can get locked out of if you don't follow the very strict requirements and look up exactly what to do before ever progressing which can lock you out of certain upgrades which is really lame. \n\nThere's also an INSANE amount of money grinding if you want to get all the upgrades, because stuff costs way too much for how much money you get by just playing casually.\n\nThere are 5 dedicated platforming segments and they are horrendously awful. They're speed challenges with no control over how fast you can go due to just waiting for really slow cycles to carry you over to the next platform. On top of which the last couple are really long, and an attempt is over in an instant because falling into spikes 1 shots you.\n\nI encountered a bunch of small little bugs here and there, mostly graphical, a couple that just made me fall through the ground and died when I shouldn't have, or where I lost horizontal control of my character, or just fell through a platform I clearly landed on. Only really effected game-play during the already awful platform sections. \n\nThough it clearly had a lot of work into it, which I appreciate, I gave up pretty quickly trying to understand the story, there was just wayyy too much reading that's in old English, that was too difficult for me to really decipher, and would have just taken too much time away from actually playing the game. I also don't like this kind of setting, but that's just me. This is by no means a bad thing, I know some people love super cryptic hard to understand story; I do to some extent but not on this level. \n\nThe Art and Music are both incredible, clearly a lot of work was put into the atmosphere of this game.\n\nApparently the best parts of the game are locked behind a new game plus cycle but I seriously don't feel like replaying the whole game.\n\nOverall: the systems and progression in the game were just way too confusing and hidden, there were some fun bosses and enemies.

The game that I bought and immediately forgot about a thousand years ago. The game that I didn't expect much from upon my return, but ended up having a whole lot of fun. \n\nI never considered myself a hardcore fan of the Metroidvania genre: for various reasons, I couldn't beat Hollow Knight and Ori, and the more \"classic\" games like Bloodstained didn't click with me at all. However, this game sucked me in literally an hour after starting, and didn't let go until the very (true) ending.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 [b]Well-Paced Exploration[/b]\nAmazingly smooth difficulty curve combined with the non-linearity of the world and abundance of secrets, from items to entire locations, provides an extremely enjoyable gaming experience. \n\nCharacter stat progression is absent in the game at all, and currency is spent on rare weapon upgrades and potions. In the case of potions, there is a permanent loss of one for each upgrade. Cool decision, design-wise. \n\nThe meta elements here are quite interesting, as the most useful upgrade the player receives is obtained through donating currency at a local church, which, upon reaching a certain threshold, grants the most convenient fast travel in the game. Although initially, it may seem that these donations are pure flavor.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 [b]Awesome Combat[/b]\nThe combat system is simple and quite intuitive. In most cases, opponents \u2014 regular mobs and bosses alike \u2014 are perfectly readable. Their animations are clear and well-optimized, with precise timing that allows the player to parry or dodge in time. \n\nI would also like to mention the boss fights. In the worst cases, they are... pretty standard. In the best cases, they are astonishing. I swear, I will remember Sierpes and Crisanta for a long time. Especially the latter\u2019s second phase which is mostly based on perfect parrying.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 [b]Lore & Aesthetics[/b]\nThe reason for my return to Blasphemous was its absolutely unique style, which is emphasized by an intricate and complex story with Spanish cultural and religious references. The imagery is so cool that it stays in my mind long after I close the game. And it will stay, I\u2019m certain of it.\n\nAll of this is conveyed through pixel art. As a simple human being, I love pixel art. I draw pixel art. I am inspired by it. Here it is of high quality only. Some backgrounds are begging to be used as wallpapers. And certain music tracks will definitely make it into my playlist and serve as background music for role-playing games.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 [b]Well, Platforming[/b]\nTo me, the only problem this game has. And it is highly subjective. The only thing to ever compete with the bosses is\u2026 iron spikes. Carefully placed literally everywhere, they are ready to annihilate you the moment your reflexes go numb for a single second. And considering how much jumping this game offers\u2026 \n\nHowever, suffering is the way.

You could call it a metroidvania Darks Souls, but I don't think it deserves to be labeled as such. The backdrop of the Spanish Inquisition (which no one ever expects!!!) lends it's itself perfectly to the bloody and grim setting of the world of Cvstodia. The platforming and combat feel nice and responsive, and there is a decent variety of enemies, speaking of - their design and that of the bosses are absolutely sick! \nAs a negative, I would point to the cryptic questlines of most of the characters (which is definitely borrowed from DS). You would most likely miss or botch a lot of them on your first playthrough.

"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3378, "last_played": 1694488147}, "language": "english", "review": "Blasphemous is a solid action metroidvania style game with an intriguing story, extensive lore, brutal combat and full of challenging moments both in it's exploration, combat and boss encounters. Though the game felt frustrating at the start of it all, once you get to learn to understand the mechanics and the importance of backtracking, you will be well on your way to being the ultimate Penitent One. \n\n[h2] The Story & World [/h2]\n\nThe story was quite solid in it's execution, going for a more dark souls like way of telling the story rather than telling you exactly what happens. In a way, it kept me well engaged. Many metroidvania games exceed at creating such unique worlds and Blasphemous doesn't disappoint in this regard, being heavily inspired by Spanish Religion, you will be going through many churches that all feel unique, in addition to snowy mountain plains, desolate hellish undergrounds, a toxic sewerage system or a ghastly Library. This is all accompanied by an amazing OST to represent the world/boss. Connected level design is also another positive thing about these types of games, providing ease of access to the player as a reward to prevent tedious linear backtracking. \n\n[h2] Gameplay & Progression [/h2]\n\nHow does the gamplay hold up? well as I mentioned before, it is truly a challenging game, every enemy you encounter after the Holy Line is unique with it's own attack patterns and behaviour with a total of 37 unique encounters (not including the bosses). Some enemies are stronger variants of each other (such as Acolytes) but all in all are unique to the area you are fighting them in. You will die a lot if you do not learn about the encounter or study the attack patterns of the enemies. By learning about what each enemy does within the encounter, you will have a better chance at succeeding and dying less. That being said, there is going to be a time where certain rooms filled with certain enemies can frustrate you and perseverance is the only answer.\n\nThe Penitent One has a decent array of movesets with his sword the Mea Culpa from a uppercut slash, a slow but powerful ground twirl, a plunge attack, a charged attack, ranged blood projectiles and a powerful dash lunge which can setup for perfect executions which are all satisfying to pull off. Along with upgrading your moveset, you can upgrade your healing items (as in the amount you can obtain/amount you can heal). Parrying and Dashing are your defence mechanics but iframes are not that frequent especially in boss fights, relying on reading the patterns of the boss you are fighting. All the bosses are unique to fight and range from powerful warriors to abominations. \n\nProgressing the game in order to become more powerful is tied to the world itself and exploring it deeply for secrets. You can obtain tears of atonement which is currency earned through killing mobs/bosses and progressing quest lines. By unlocking relics, they can help open new paths to explore and further expand your arsenal, such as and is not limited too: health upgrades, fervour upgrades, rosary knots/beads to give buffs/defences for certain scenarios, Hearts for your sword which will provide a huge buff along with a debuff, prayers and consume fervour to unleash powerful buffs, defences or attacks, collecting bones that unlock a new boss and cosmetic and finally finding Children of Moonlight to track down. \n\n[h2] Replayability [/h2]\n\nAfter I was able to 100% my New Game file, the only thing left to do was play True Torment (NG+) which resets all of your progress while retaining most of the stuff you found already in that file. In NG+ as expected, you will fight enemies that are stronger and deal more damage but in return you earn more tears to make the grind less tedious and elongated. In addition you get 3 traits to choose from. Red turns the game into an old school side platformer where instead of a health bar, you get health orbs, which can help with annoying boss fights/traps/enemies. The Blue one weakens your sword attacks by half but allow your fervour to regenerate passively rather than having to earn it through attacks only. Finally the black one turns the game into dark souls in a sense where if you die, you lose all of your currency, cant use prayers and have to collect the guilt where you died and your flasks no longer heal health but fervour, making for a more punishing playthough but a good challenge nonetheless. by beating the game with each trait, you will unlock a new bead/skin. \n\nIn addition to NG+, there is new content to play, such as fighting 4 skeletal bosses each with a unique weapon that has a unique attack pattern all to progress to a final boss that uses all 4, testing your skills and knowledge on the bosses you fought prior. A new ending is also unlocked where you have to explore the new areas to find it, as well as paying attention to the NPCs you encounter. Thee there is content is one I personally dislike as they are platforming challenges and that is the Strife and Ruin which was a collaboration with the Bloodstained series protagonist Miriam, as I found it to show a lot of the frustrating parts of the platforming in this game when presented as a challenge but thankfully that is just optional and you get a decent prayer as a reward so up to you.\n\nOnce you are done exploring all of the base game, you can challenge the bosses again in a progressive style known as Sacred Sorrows which will rank you based on many things and serves as a challenge.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with Blasphemous, so much to the point I wanted to 100% this games achievements and I'm glad I did, It provides a satisfying gameplay loop, allowing the player to discover a unique world where they are rewarded for paying attention to the little details and explore every nook and cranny to further progress the penitent one to become stronger than ever. A vast array of beads, prayers and hearts allow for extensive customisation and variety, all wrapped together with a story that is mysterious but extensive. Awelcome addition to action metroidvania games.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1694493211, "timestamp_updated": 1694493211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146150448": {"recommendationid": "146150448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306456654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 794, "last_played": 1694488830}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best adventure games due to the theme alone.

However, it's important to note some aspects that might not appeal to everyone, as well as my own experiences and what I've heard from others.\n\nHack and Slash: This game leans towards the hack-and-slash genre, which might not be everyone's cup of tea. If you're not a fan of this style of gameplay, it might not be the best fit for you.\n\nAbundance of Items: The game boasts a vast inventory of items, which can sometimes lead to the need for external resources or guides to understand their full potential and usage.\n\nEarly Game Challenges: In the initial stages, the game can be a bit demanding as you work to accumulate currency, explore, and avoid perishing.\n\nConfusing Elements: At times, the game's intricacies and plot can become a bit perplexing, potentially requiring extra attention to fully grasp.\n\nComplex Lore: The game's lore can be intricate, and not everyone may delve into it deeply. Some players might prefer a more straightforward narrative.\n\nMultiple Endings: There are reportedly three different endings in the game, which might not appeal to those who prefer to move on to new experiences once they've completed a game.\n\nDespite these considerations, I personally found these aspects to be engaging rather than off-putting. The hack-and-slash gameplay, adorned with visually stunning gore effects, was right up my alley. The music resonated with me, and the pixel art was truly captivating.\n\nIf you share my passion for 2D games, adventurous exploration, metroidvania mechanics, diverse item combinations, and varied combat styles, then I highly recommend giving this game a shot.

I'm so mad that after spending 20 hours and already on the NG+ I still hadnt got the bloody sand. Like I was so mad cause I got so stuck with nowhere to go that I figured \"well, maybe after I kill the final boss the new zones unlock and he gives me the thing to activate the red dots and the golden roots\" well no my dude, after spending 10+ hours on the huge map it turns out you have to go to the tutorial part of the game to open a door which inside is the thing you will yell at for the entire game if you dont have it. So yeah, I had to look up a guide to find the last statue to destroy for the good ending, which needs the bloody sand, which made me want to look out for it in the ENTIRE map, just for it to be in the tutorial part of the game. Also you need to destroy statues for an ending and thats really not apparent either.\nOther thing that ruined my experience was being able to just not see Redento in the second part of the garden, like, I only found him and could end his quest because I started jumping from every cliff possible looking for the blood sand, turns out he gave the item thats needed for jumping on slimy floor.\nAs you can see im so angry for wasting so much time looking for that one stupid thing, doing all side quests by proxy, getting stuck having looked at *literally* every room, found the arcade and most oil mana things before the blood sand and even got to NG+ getting stuck again.\nHope the second game is clearer because I feel like my time was wasted and its such a shame because the fights, artstyle and music is so good.", "timestamp_created": 1694399429, "timestamp_updated": 1694399429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146093967": {"recommendationid": "146093967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202765277", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1013, "playtime_at_review": 1536, "last_played": 1700426719}, "language": "english", "review": "2d darksouls.

"last_played": 1693916519}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall Score - 6/10\n\n[h1] Disclaimer for those in India [/h1]\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME at its current price. If you check steam's price history, Blasphemous saw a roughly 350% increase in its price, putting it at just about on par with the American USD rate. This is ridiculous as far as regional pricing goes and the game most definitely is NOT worth the current amount of Rs. 1999 (as of Sept. 2023). Buy this game when it's on heavy discount, if at all. Otherwise, just go for something else.\n\n[h3] Ok, game review [/h3]\nI could not bring myself to finish this game, there just was not enough of a motive for me to keep playing. I got to around the final boss and though I did have some late game stuff left to explore, I couldn't muster the enthusiasm to invest time into it.\n\n[h3] The Good Stuff [/h3]\nThe art style is beautiful, especially the creature and character designs. If you're someone who is a fan of gore and just super weird shit, then you're gonna at least have a good time staring at your screen. The environment design ranges from fine to amazing, but the creature designs are definitely what stands out the most. Blasphemous's art is heavily rooted in religious iconography most notably taken from Christianity and it plays around with that concept in some extremely gruesome ways.\n\nThe sound design is what really carried the experience for me. It is so good. The OS, combat sounds, creature sounds, and just about everything is top-notch and really helps to immerse in Blasphemous' weird universe.\n\n[h3] The Bad [/h3]\nThe game tries too damn hard to be edgy, it's gory, gruesome, biblical, and weird, and it'll beat you over the head with it. \n\nAlso why would you use a Blackletter font for a pixel art game?? I get why it was used thematically, but it just made reading item descriptions such a chore, especially considering a lot of the terms are very specific to just Blasphemous. I often misread many words and mostly could not be bothered with reading more than two lines or until I understood what the item did in-game.\n\nThe combat and platforming were by far the weakest aspects of the game for me, the combat is just fine when it comes to the regular enemies, other than a few of the enemies which just bring the gameplay down to a halt and sometimes require you to simply tank hits. The boss fights were just okay, I think it took me only about 2-3 tries for most bosses, though some of the late-game boss fights were A LOT better than those in the early to mid-game.\n\nThe platforming is my main gripe with this game as the tools given offer such a poor experience while traversing the levels and a majority of this game requires you to traverse large distances to get anywhere. I don't think I enjoyed even a single instance of platforming. A lot of the ledges you need to jump to are also this 2.5D thing which made it confusing to know when you've actually landed on something. There is no flow to the character's movement.\n\n[h1] In Conclusion [/h1]\nI had a little bit of fun playing Blasphemous, it would have been an okay experience were it not for the awful platforming. The game progression is also way too obscure and half the time you don't even know where you're supposed to go. It's somehow like Dark Souls 1 but without the beautiful world, lore, and characters. If you're looking for a similar experience to this then I'd suggest Ender Lilies, Ori, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Salt and Sanctuary, Shovel Knight, Furi, Katana Zero. Though Blasphemous is a competently made game, I had a lot more of an enjoyable experience playing these other game.", "timestamp_created": 1694342786, "timestamp_updated": 1694343273, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146039269": {"recommendationid": "146039269", "author": {"steamid": "76561199219404107", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2643, "last_played": 1695010967}, "language": "spanish", "review": "45 horas de gameplay y Crisanja jamas se encuera, seria mi unica queja, juegazo.", "timestamp_created": 1694334481, "timestamp_updated": 1694334481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146036699": {"recommendationid": "146036699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008487360", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 5215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3353, "last_played": 1694941235}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Joyful be the heart![/h1]\nThere are some video games that can be easily said that they go beyond being the source of entertainment. That they reach further, into the field of a fine work of art. One of those games is definitely Blasphemous. Astounding atmosphere and lore, coated with totally beautiful and detailed pixel-art graphic and climatic music, both fitting the in-game world they represent and portray.\n\nThis could be enough to classify Blasphemous as a work of art, but one mustn't forget about something equally important as the things I mentioned earlier, which is gameplay and everything surrounding it. It is as polished as the audiovisual side of this game, meaning that we have a lot of abilities and combos to perform, challenging bosses to defeat, various platforming sequences to go through. Level design is superb and, combined with a minimap allowing to put markers etc. on it, makes a player accustomed to the whole area they are currently in.\n\nCherry on the top are achievements. They are fair, rewarding, and definitely doable. Some of them are easier to get, some are harder, but with enough practice getting 100% achievements doesn't seem like an impossible task at all.\n\nAny cons? Sometimes it's not clear, at least on a first glance, what to do exactly to reach a particular ending or finish a quest, often bound to an achievement. It's a minor inconvenience, in my opinion. It might seem annoying at times, but doesn't take the joy of playing this game. At least it did not in my case.\n\nI definitely recommend Blasphemous.

From its beautifully grotesque world to its challenging combat, it offers an unholy amount of fun. With its captivating lore, engaging combat, and great level design, this game will keep you hooked for hours if you're a fan of Metroidvanias.\n\nIf you explore thoroughly, you'll become quite powerful thanks to all the upgrades you'll find. Don't worry, it remains enjoyable and never gets boring. The balance evens out in NG+ mode, which is the best New Game+ experience I've had in any game. You can choose from three stipulations that completely alter the game's dynamics, keeping each new playthrough fresh.\n\nI also loved the Easter Eggs hidden throughout the game. Also, the ability to unlock skins after completing certain challenges was a nice nod to the past when skins were earned as proof of achievements rather than purchased. Yes, you can buy one skin here too, but still.\n\nHighly recommended.

While difficulty is the name of the game for soulslike and exploration/world connection is the same for metroidvanias this one falls short in that the difficulty is placed almost completely on the clunkiness of the character. The dash most of the time places you into the hitbox of the enemy you are trying to dash stab, and to not attempt a dash stab and get a execute is essentially wasting time. The obstacles are almost unavoidable at certain points in the game so you are bound to get damaged from SOMETHING. Getting hit from an enemy that walks into you is absolutely frustrating, and you cant dash past most enemies that you feel like you should be able to. A handful of the boss fights are ok, but ok at best. There is no flow, and many times the obstacles require you to wait an excruciatingly long time (looking at the fog clouds in the tower). The parry is ok, but parrying larger enemies leaves you staggered, knocks you back a bit, and does not reward you in the slightest, so whats the point?

You'll have NPCs spouting terms and events that make no sense in what your'e trying to do in the game, so if story telling is your thing, and you're not into figuring out what the heck went down, this game isn't for you. Also brief aside of the story, ending C, the game's canon ending that apparently leads into the events of the sequel, is missable and missing it requires you to start over or play New Game Plus, but the latter is recommended due to a few bosses in the game are exclusive to New Game Plus. \n\nToo many of the upgrades are too far off the beaten path and require the usual affair of not being able to access them until you get a tool to reach them, but you get these tools so late that you'll forget about them unless you remember to mark them on your map to come back later. If you expect the game to hand you upgrades, the ones that the game naturally gives you, or the ones that you can immediately get as soon as you stray off the beaten path is minimal. I ended the game with like two magical abilities (Prayers) and one or two passive abilities (Hearts). So don't expect to have that many toys to play with unless you either take the time to go back every now and then to look for them when you get a new traversal tool, look them up, or play New Game Plus since all traversal tools that you unlock (some are optional, but required to get certain items and abilities) are carried over, so you can just go to every side path and get nearly everything in the game.\n\nFInally, the movement and platforming is a bit clunky, not the most terrible thing I've played, but it feels a little jank at times. \n\nWith all those caveats out of the way, the combat is fun, parrying feels very good, and presents a fair challenge.

If you're a fan of games that focus more on combat & less on platforming, then I recommend getting Blasphemous.\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is that the NPC quests & quest items aren't explained clearly enough, and the only reason I was able to complete [b]most[/b] of them without a guide is because I happened to have the right item at the right time.

The gothic architecture, religious elements, and gore all painted an image of medieval dystopian fantasy. It's a unique setting that I don't think I've ever seen anything similar to before. The game is worth playing just for the visuals alone.\n\nCombat never felt unfair. There are many tools at your disposal to use against the variety of common enemies - equipment, prayers (basically spells), plus the different ways to use your sword. All the boss fights felt unique which is a plus.

so! The art is beautiful, both in the scenery as well as the enemy/character designs. The gameplay holds up really well overall, with a couple awkward mechanics (like jumping off of enemies for a little boost).\n\nThe OST is quite wonderful, as is the voice acting. The difficulty is considerable, but not too unreasonable if you have some experience with games like this.\n\nThe storytelling/worldbuilding is so incredibly souls-esque which could be good or bad depending on your taste -- while the world is immersive, the narrative can get a bit confusing at times, especially if you don't pay attention to all the details. But that's what can also make it so enticing -- might make you want to watch a video on the story or find every last thing in the game.\n\nReally solid! Excited to play the DLC and the sequel.

Not good form for a metroidvania, guys! Ehh. The platforming, also, is generally not great - you don't have a platforming moveset so it tends to just involve a lot of awkward jumping, wall clinging, and ledge grabbing, but it's not the highlight of the game anyways.\n\nAnd then, aesthetically, the game is absolutely not for me - way too gory and gross, even if there's something... satisfying, about all the twisted christian imagery, eheh. And the lore and story... exist. Lore is presented in a really annoying way in the inventory screen and I stopped reading it after a while because the actual dialogue is... so overwrought my brain can't be bothered to parse it. The plot happens. I guess. I dunno, don't really care about it but it sure does happen.\n\nRight, so, all the nitpicks out of the way - I'm kinda shocked at how good the game actually feels to play, in spite of all its limitations? Combat is built really well around your swordplay, your parry and your dodge, with some ingredients of positioning and platforming in some instances, and you get your spells and some rad sword upgrades to complete your toolkit - never really used the horribly slow charge attack, and the blood projectile only saw minor use, but other than that, like, basically every combat option I was given I found some use for and that's both. So cool and so RARE.\n\nAnd the enemy designs remain pretty consistently diverse - there's maybe a small handful of enemy reskins across its 50+ standard mobs, not to mention the bosses which all feel distinct and interesting, both in their fighting style and their gimmicks. Again, there's maybe one or two fights that feel kiiiind of scuffed - and, shockingly, I'd say the (standard) final boss is one of the easiest fights in the game - but in general they're all pretty dang fun to fight.\n\nThe game's also... not, that hard, necessarily. Like I said. Like, the bosses are pretty great, but... during standard play, you're hardly gonna notice because you're not gonna die to most of the basegame bosses, like, ever. I sucked and I still beat most of them first try, because you have so much health and so much healing and such a bounty of options at hand that you're rarely forced to -learn- fights - I had to come back doing the no potions achievement to REALLY face the bosses, I feel like. The DLC bosses trend a lot harder, of course, especially the ones on the true ending path, and I DID have to, like, learn those fights, so, I feel like they got a better sense of balance the more game they released.\n\nWhich, like, isn't it super cool that there's just three whole free DLC expansions? Much akin to hollow knight, though frankly, I think the inclusions here are meatier and, on the whole, better. New game plus with bonus challenges and an entire new set of bosses tied to anew quest, a full-on boss rush mode, a crossover with bloodstained and a set of platforming gauntlets alongside it, an entire new story path, including a new zone, a few new bosses, and new animations and cutscenes? That's a LOT!\n\n...granted, not all of the DLC inclusions are actually, like, great. The Bloodstained DLC is especially egregious as, as previously mentioned, platforming is NOT this game's forte and most of these platforming gauntlets SUCK as a result. Do you like waiting around on slow moving platforms for 2-3 minutes? Where one mistake sends you into the instakill spikes? Haaaaave fuuuuun~ Yeah, no, they're utter tripe and kind of a - heh - stain on the game as a whole. I have to wonder if they're bad on purpose to make Bloodstained look worse compared to Blasphemous - chill out, guys, Bloodstianed did that just fine on its own. The new area added in the DLC is also pretty trash, though - way way WAY too powerful mobs, huge screens full of an annoying environmental hazard that, despite this, have almost nothing of note on them... complete dud in my books. I can take or leave the boss rush and the NG+ penitences, they're content for someone else who isn't me to enjoy :V\n\nOh and I should at least mention the map design and exploration, which is another major highlight - the world opens up in three major directions pretty much immediately - and then after a chokepoint in the middle of the game, busts pretty wide open for the second half as well - and the map's naturally designed to loop back around and open up shortcuts - on top of two different fast travel systems you eventually unlock - so it's got both convenience and exploration down to a T.  Lots of little side-paths and secrets, fake walls you can generally stumble upon naturally (but there is eventually an item to help track them down more easily), I'm generally not a fan of when metroidvania maps make you keep track of everything yourself but it's not too bad here. I dunno, the world's just satisfying to explore. Each zone isn't too terribly big, there's just, a lot of them, so things stay fresh throughout!\n\nI do have my criticisms, obviously, but I ended up pretty well engrossed in this one and even went out of my way to 100% it - achievement-wise, anyways, though I did at least see myself through all the DLC bosses and true ending added, so I've seen all the unique content the game has to offer - and for the price, you do get quite a good bit, on top of the game just being, again - good! It's really good. I'll check out the sequel next year though I think I've had enough of this game for now.

Cada uno de ellos presenta un desaf\u00edo \u00fanico y emocionante, y las batallas son intensas y llenas de adrenalina. La estrategia es clave, y me encontr\u00e9 disfrutando cada encuentro, incluso cuando me venc\u00edan una y otra vez. La sensaci\u00f3n de logro al finalmente superar a un boss es inigualable.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, la atm\u00f3sfera del juego es realmente impresionante. Los gr\u00e1ficos y la m\u00fasica se combinan para crear un mundo oscuro y sombr\u00edo que te sumerge por completo en la experiencia. Los detalles visuales y la atenci\u00f3n al dise\u00f1o son evidentes en cada rinc\u00f3n del mapa.\n\nBlasphemous ha superado mis expectativas en todos los sentidos, y estoy emocionada por en el futuro jugar el Blasphemous 2.

Soy un completista amante de los metroidvania y comenc\u00e9 a jugar sin mayor informaci\u00f3n, s\u00f3lo un par de trailers con los que me top\u00e9 y vi sin muchos \u00e1nimos, nada que me hiciera presagiar tremenda experiencia y buena impresi\u00f3n que me gener\u00f3 este t\u00edtulo. Mi primera partida fue con esa precauci\u00f3n caracter\u00edstica de los plataformeros en los que vas midiendo las mec\u00e1nicas, analizando los movimientos y el comportamiento del mundo de Custodia. Cuando cae el primer boss delante del Penitente me fui directamente a machacar el bot\u00f3n de ataque sobre \u00e9l, tremendo error, mor\u00ed un par de veces hasta pillarle el ritmo y poder manejarme con los patrones, la esquiva a\u00fan no la comprend\u00eda muy bien y los matraces son limitados y te dejan al descubierto unos instantes lo que te obliga a no abusar de ellos. Posterior a este enfrentamiento y en la medida que me adentraba m\u00e1s en el juego pod\u00eda admirar y embelesarme de sus paisajes tan bien logrados, se siente lo l\u00fagubre de algunas localizaciones y lo sacro en otras, adem\u00e1s la m\u00fasica complementa muy arm\u00f3nicamente con cada instancia, aunque muy cortos encontr\u00e9 los ritmos y al poco rato las tonadas se vuelven repetitivas aunque no es un gran punto en contra. Complet\u00e9 esta partida sin buscar gu\u00edas ya que quer\u00eda saber cu\u00e1nto lograba obtener y el resultado fue s\u00faper grato.\nEn mi segunda partida (NG+) fui m\u00e1s en profundidad con los rezos y la build del rosario, experimentaba en cada rinc\u00f3n de lo escenarios y me di el tiempo de leer las descripciones de los objetos y recolectar todo lo que fuese posible, descubrir todos los finales y probar las penitencias. Todo \u00e9sto me dej\u00f3 una experiencia bastante agradable, el juego tiene mucho contenido y es muy rejugable lo que te lleva a partidas completamente distintas, utilizando las cuentas, corazones y rezos que en alg\u00fan momento ignoraste, adem\u00e1s de sus finales m\u00faltiples que te dejan un buen sabor de satisfacci\u00f3n.\nMi \u00faltima partida (NG) la jugu\u00e9 para para completar la lista de logros y fue en \u00e9sta d\u00f3nde me sent\u00ed como el real penitente. Las mec\u00e1nicas ya las dominaba por completo y pod\u00eda alternar entre la guardia, esquives y saltos para derrotar a los enemigos los cuales ya no ten\u00edan oportunidad alguna. Logr\u00e9 avanzar y derrotar de forma muy simple a casi todos los jefes (te odio Esdras). Ya los modelados y ambientaciones me parec\u00edan una obra de arte, la excelente historia est\u00e1 muy bien hilada y se siente aut\u00e9ntica, los personajes y sus di\u00e1logos te hacen conectarte con el todo del lore y el espa\u00f1ol ostia (por primera vez xD) es el mejor idioma en el que se puede disfrutar esta gran obra. Se nota el tremendo esfuerzo y cari\u00f1o que todo el equipo ha puesto en este tremendo juegazo.

This is by far my favorite metroidvania and one of my favorite games of all time. It easily has the best integration of dark souls elements with a 2d metroidvania. It hits the right spot of atmosphere, difficulty, and no hand holding. The art style is iconic and foreboding. The difficulty is high at times but often gives you other challenges so you can later return where you're struggling. There is no quest log telling you what to do but the game allows you to mark out your map so you can figure out quests for yourself.

The combat is pretty decent, but it is hampered by mediocre hitboxes and gameplay issues. This game heavily relies on artificial difficulty, where they increase the number of enemies or the number of environmental hazards in an area to make it harder. There are also enemies in a later area that spawn out of thin air and can spawn directly on your character, making you take free damage from an enemy that you cannot even see. Similarly, the boss encounters are incredibly weak imo. Most bosses have a very small moveset of 3-4 moves that they relentlessly spam and later in the encounter, the bosses will just increase how quickly they use this repetitive moveset. It makes most fights very boring and while most bosses are very well-designed, their fights don't have the same effect. One simple gameplay mechanic that frustrated me to hell was the fact that your character is knocked down when taking damage in most cases. The bosses take advantage of this knockdown by spamming more of their attacks while you're knocked down, which in most cases would be fine, but it seems like the knockdown is an animation lock causing you to not be able to move or parry while you're down. You also will likely need a guide for this game because all of the item descriptions or questlines are incredibly cryptic and its often near impossible to determine what to do with specific quest items. Finally, while lorewise the final boss of the game is interesting, the actual encounter is a massive letdown due to the fight being terribly boring/uninteresting in phase 1 and gimmicky to an extent that it becomes frustrating in phase 2. Overall, I still enjoyed my time with this game, but I think that there are many gameplay aspects that don't feel right and I hope that they are fixed in Blasphemous 2.", "timestamp_created": 1693775359, "timestamp_updated": 1693775406, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536921083927154541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145618024": {"recommendationid": "145618024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316676720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 761, "last_played": 1694467970}, "language": "english", "review": "don't listen to the folks who say the storyline is impossible to understand. it is purposefully esoteric in the beginning but becomes more understandable as the game goes on. i found the cryptic nature of the early game to be akin to elden ring, but easier to grasp. additionally some folks in these reviews seem to be complaining about various storyline endings being blocked based on personal player character decisions, but that's like... every role playing game ever(????). overall thoroughly enjoyed this game, and im not normally a fan of platformers or metroidvanias. the soundtrack is reminiscent of diablo II, and the pixel art gives a refreshing break from contemporary triple a bullshit graphic sandwiches. defo recommend, even at full price", "timestamp_created": 1693774252, "timestamp_updated": 1693774252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145617886": {"recommendationid": "145617886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047607436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1169, "last_played": 1693890878}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1693774067, "timestamp_updated": 1693774067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145617303": {"recommendationid": "145617303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346104127", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 603, "last_played": 1693773273}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a subpar metroid vania, which is a category that's filled to the brim with masterpieces in 2023.

It is absolutely atrocious. The wall-jumping mechanics are the weirdest I've ever experienced. In order to jump \"up\" the wall, you have to jump up, out, and back in in a crazy arc. Jumping from ladder to ladder is brutal; there's an almost full second delay from where you press 'up' and your character actually grabs on to the ladder. \n\n-Level design is pretty poor. There're either no save points anywhere or three save points all clustered together in one spot, making each one kind of useless. So when you inevitably die far away from one when doing some exploring, it's just absolutely brutal to have to go all the way back through trap-valley to try and collect your dead body. \n\n-The traps placed, while unique, are often brutal with janky hit frames. The spikes in this game are the absolute worst. If even your pinkie toe touches the spikes, your character suddenly teleports to an impaled state. \n\n\nI'll probably finish the game if I get the time, just because I spent the money on it. But yeah, wouldn't recommend. The gameplay mechanics just suck. They're clunky and obviously need refinement.\n\nUpdate: My above review stands as is. I'm reaching the end and the platforming is just the worst. They're not trying to make it difficult, they're just trying to be annoying and kill you. Floors crumble out of nowhere and lead to spike pits, every improper jump is punished with an insta-kill spike pit.

The controls felt a little wonky to me in the beginning, but every game has a rough start. Did that feeling ever change? No.\n\nDo you like a lot of challenging platforming, even tho the controls may not be the best in comparison to other metroidvanias? This is the game for you. \nDo you like challenging bosses and new movement abilities, that make the game a fluent experience? Absolutely stay away from this game. \n\nThe bossfights (so far) are not hard at all; most of them are just attack spam with a few parries or dodges in between, the hardest part was to get into the controls in the span of the first hour. The final straw for me was the Mourning and Havoc area. It's so anti-fun, I can't even put it into words. I like a good challenge, but this is not challenging. It's annoying.\nAnother bad thing, in my opinion, are the quests, general progression and items. When did it become the golden standard to make every questline as confusing as possible? Why am I not allowed to find new relics by just casually playing the game? Everything is a riddle now, often you do not know where to go and I don't want to glue my eyes on a guide to enjoy a game. Sorry.\n\nThe graphics however are great, really interesting designs everywhere. I don't like the pixelated style over a longer period of time, but that's not a real problem, just personal preference of other styles.

For most of it, the platforming is absurdly simple, and only serves wake you up when getting bored of the abruptly placed insta-death traps and copy/paste encounters around the world.\n One good example being towards the end of the game, where they decided to place a checkpoint between two moving platforms over a death pit. The challenge is simply waiting for the platform to be close enough to jump on, then waiting for the next one to align. No gameplay, no challenge, and not even the relief of escaping the obstacles for even one brief moment.\n\n What's worse, is that the game also tries to be a metroidvania, leaving certain collectibles behind closed doors for later. A type of level design I'm usually fond of, as it makes you engage in learning your environment and tests your observation. Sadly there's rarely ever a satisfying reward behind these doors, leaving you with a feeling of having wasted time by playing through the exact same drawn-out platforming sequences again, without the novelty of seeing it for the first time.\n\n The only thing really motivating you to keep playing the game is the intriguing world and promise that your efforts will be rewarded. Sadly that is also used against you, as the game rarely lets you interact with characters in meaningful ways while also frequently locking you out from progressing their story lines with arbitrary invisible counters that eventually kill them off.\n While I usually appreciate developers who require you pay attention and engage in the world in order to get the best outcome, it feels unfair when nothing is clearly communicated or telegraphed. It completely robs you of the immersion to rely on outside information (searching wikis, guides or playing the game multiple times) in order to get rewarded.\n\nThere's so much more I'd like to say about this game, but it's already wasted enough of my time.", "timestamp_created": 1693664359, "timestamp_updated": 1693664359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

As someone who started with Hollow Knight, it is hard to find good Metroidvania titles that can keep up.

Which is a shame, since there's obviously a lot to like here, aesthetically. The art and music are gorgeous. Traversing environments, in a vacuum, is fun. However, the whole picture of combat and the nature of controlling your character is straight up rubbish. I don't think anyone on the development team actually played this. Trying to grab ledges and hanging onto walls has got to be among the worst frustration I've ever experienced in a video game, while in combat. There's so much unforeseen circumstance waiting to screw you over. If you have any reservations and care deeply about the core package of movement in a platforming game, don't buy this.\n\n---edit---\n\nAfter playing through what feels like the majority of the game, I can safely say nothing's improved. In fact, it's gotten worse. Everything that irked me in my first few hours has snowballed into unfathomable levels of bullshit. Encountering later, newer obstacles makes me feel as though development was an afterthought. There appears to be no proper or optimal way to manage anything, as if the player character and the environment were developed irrespective of one another. This is exacerbated by the game's propensity to copy and paste enemies when it didn't quite hit that threshold of unfairness the developers were looking for. Nothing is patterned well either, and otherwise fair encounters are rendered wild and unpredictable. Not to mention the unfettered, bonkers nonsense that incurs from having no grace period of invulnerability, after being knocked around. This leads to a whole host of issues as you get pummeled across boards like a beach ball, until you're dead and miles away from wherever the fuck you just were. Also, whose brilliant idea was it to require an input to get through the death screen? Like, really, what the hell is the point of that? It becomes an unrelenting annoyance after dying to all this aforementioned garbage fifty times in a row. Especially, when it won't accept controller inputs and I have to reach over and press something on my keyboard; way to take my ass out of the experience.

Every upgrade in this game is gated by secrets that can be missed. If you play this game mark your map so you know where to go back from.  The dlc content can be convoluted and it all requires back tracking. Also very little is explained which is ok if the mechanics are intuitive. For the life of me I dont understand why Dark souls like games don't adopt the same system of if you unlock a shrine you can port over there. Stop making porting to shrines something you have to earn! Good grief! PS tithe at the church because it provides considerable upgrades. \n\nThe end bosses/dlc bosses that provide the hardest content are can be a bit cheap and shows the developers honest attempt to recreate dark souls like bosses but what they miss is that in dark souls those bosses have many ways to be beaten. In the game that dynamic is missing and most likely to be said bosses will require you to find secrets to upgrade your character like certain prayers or beads. Or of course you can just git gud and became a no hit player. \n\nUltimately I dont like that power level of the character is gated by discovery more than combat and challenging battles. Hopefully they struck a better balance in the sequel. \n\nIn conclusion, a solid game that misses being truly great due to the above design issues.

The art style and heavy Spanish and Catholic influence is greatly appreciated and gives the game a character that I've never seen in another game before. Bosses are designed as if by an expert painter from centuries past.  \n\nThe gameplay itself is relatively simple, but enjoyable: \n\n- Level design was interesting. You would often find shortcuts back to the start of the level or to another level that seemed far away or unreachable, making the world feel interconnected instead of linear. \n- Character quests were vague, but not so vague as to require a guide every step of the way. You simply had to pay attention to dialogue and item descriptions to deduce the next step. \n- All spells (prayers) had a specific usecase, not one spell felt weak or obsolete if you acquired a new one. \n- Items always felt useful. Every time you found an item, you knew it would be helpful in some way, not more garbage to fill up your inventory screen (like crafting materials for weak consumables in other games). \n- Power-ups feel meaningful every step of the way.\n- Tons of secrets to discover and replayability with NG+ challenge modes.\n- The game doesn't cop out of letting you become straight up invincible with the right setup. \n\nHowever, the game could get annoying or even infuriating at times: \n\n- Fast travelling between save points is locked behind a 50k purchase, which essentially means that you will not have it until you have already traversed most of the map. Moreover, it's not clearly stated that fast travel is even an option if you spend that amount of money. It just seems you're throwing your money down a pit, until you suddenly get a feature that you should have at the very least by the middle of the game. As well, 50k is incredibly hard to come by without exploits, because most enemies drop no more than 800 gold. Crazy. \n- Platforming can be extremely buggy. The Penitent will get stuck going down ladders or even refuse to grab them altogether, plummeting to his death. He will refuse to ledge-grab on platforms he \"missed\" by a few pixels. And don't start me on lantern hopping. It's used for pretty much a few optional locations in the game, so I have no idea why it's even there, it makes no sense, and if you have the DLC, it actually becomes one of the worst features in the game. About that...\n- I hope whoever designed Miriam's challenges has to wipe his ass with a Carolina Reaper for penance. The game was clearly not designed with precise platforming in mind, so timed platforming challenges are straight up bullshit.

It was an okay adventure, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\n\nGood things:\n-Art, sound, and setting are stylistic and extremely high quality\n-Overall, gameplay is functional and solidly average\n\nBad things:\n-The story, cutscenes, and most of the in-game text are incomprehensible\n-Many of the puzzle rooms have obscure solutions and will probably require referencing the internet. Thankfully none are related to necessary items\n-Movement controls are too stiff\n-Character movement is unusually slow for this style of game. Fast travel between savepoints helps, but the way to unlock it is optional and easily missed\n-There are way too many slow environmental traps and elevators whose only challenge is forcing the player to wait. They make the already-slow traversal much more of a chore than it should be\n-A lot of rooms open to a tiny ledge that drops to a chasm. If you slide into the doorway or walk in while not paying attention, it's instant death\n-This one's minor but.. the death screen says \"Press any button to continue\" and will only accept keyboard inputs regardless of the control scheme.

"last_played": 1694144047}, "language": "english", "review": "Having completed the game I stand by everything here but there's more:\nThe game is awfully badly paced, the easiest bosses come last, you have to use viridiana for an achievement so just use her as soon as possible. Final boss has no telegraphs. It's not about experience in the genre, it's not even about memorizing the attack pattern, you just have to hope your block won't end too soon when you guess her next move. The platforming sequences with clunky slow and non-responsive controls are more common in the latter half.\nThe final final miniboss of the game is literally right after the final boss just as padding to close out some sort of a story? Achievement for 100% is locked behind also completing some random DLC sidequest which is just about the dumbest thing... You can tell a lot of love went into this game, just not in the areas that matter.\n\nToday was the last drop. I wanted to like this game, really did. But these beginner game developer/designer mistakes are simply intolerable.\n\n1) Not all the controls are taught to you through-out the course of the game. When you pick up and item and want to read the description of it to determine whether it's worth equiping or not, sometimes the part of the description that's important is off-screen. If you want to read that part, you'll have to know how to scroll that description. Hint: scroll-wheel does NOT work. Oh and if you wanted to check the controls mid-game?\n\n2) There is no pause menu, no settings menu, you have no ability to adjust anything regarding the game while you're in-game, only in the start-up screen. Want to adjust the audio? Restart the game. Video settings? Restart the game. Check or change controls? Re. Start. The. Game. Alternatively you have to alt-tab out of the game to google the controls.\n\n3) Speaking of alt-tabbing, don't. The game does NOT care whether it's in focus or not. It will continue to accept input even if another application is in the foreground and focused. This means that if you alt-tab to write a message to your friend or type anything anywhere, some of those letters you're typing may be accepted by the game as input. In my case, which is today's last drop, I started up the game, and while waiting for it to load (which takes absolute ages given the relatively tiny size of the game) I was chatting. The game accepted those inputs, navigated to the game save menu AND DELETED MY ENTIRE PROGRESS.\n\nAside from the meta problems above, the gameplay is okay for the most part. I'll just point out a couple of them that negatively stood out.\n\n4) Mechanics seems to be misnamed or just poorly implemented sometimes, specifically parry. It's not really a parry, it's a block. For all the encounters I've had in the game (about 25% in) there were only 2 enemies against which there was an actual parry response, everywhere else it's just a block. Misnomer at best but still slightly annoying.\n\n4.1) More nails in the coffin for parry, it has basically no place in this game. The timing window for some attacks seem intuitive but when you use that same intuition for other attacks, it just let's the attack through either before you even take the parry stance. You simply have to get hit or die a couple of times to memorize the timing window for each parriable attack, but still annoying. In any case, there's almost no point in using this instead of dashing behind the enemy whenever possible, you'll probably forget you even have this ability.\n\n5) Sluggish controls in general. There's no chaining or cancelling actions. There seems to be a cooldown a little bit after almost every action you can take during which you may not start another action. Pacing of the game strongly focuses on the platforming, for which the deficiencies the controls have are most apparent (and abhorent). For some this might be the \"real\" experience, to me this is just annoying.\n\n6) The hitboxes are completely broken. There's just no regard to what is shown to you on screen. Oh a projectile flew 2 player character heights above you? Yea that hit you. A lazer passes through you? Nah you're good fam.\nhttps://youtu.be/LcJVK4qTnz0\n\nBut it's okay guys, the dev included like 4 completely redundant CRT shaders taken from their first course on how to write shaders or stolen from shadertoy! No seriously, some good things about this game: The bosses and puzzles are fun, the pixel art is lovely, sound design is good and the story is enjoyable. I'll keep playing the game for those reasons alone, despite all the issues I listed, simply because it's a good enough experience to be worth the trouble (once you've been made aware of the broken-ness and can effectively avoid it, that is). It is however NOT anywhere near worth 25 USD or EUR. At most this could be a 10 dollar game, and that's pushing it. I got it for 6.50 that's the only reason this game didn't immediately get refunded. It's not just unpolished, it's unfinished. This should be a private alpha, not a release for 25 bucks.", "timestamp_created": 1693033240, "timestamp_updated": 1694144341, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486432552337646484", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145035871": {"recommendationid": "145035871", "author": {"steamid": "76561199108725027", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 371, "last_played": 1694713185}, "language": "spanish", "review": "me gusta el ambiente y los enemigos", "timestamp_created": 1693027851, "timestamp_updated": 1693027851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145035089": {"recommendationid": "145035089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198885963839", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 608, "last_played": 1693980790}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1693026652, "timestamp_updated": 1693026652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145034609": {"recommendationid": "145034609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297880022", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1693147212}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game!!", "timestamp_created": 1693025907, "timestamp_updated": 1693025907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145030686": {"recommendationid": "145030686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851568429", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1963, "last_played": 1674327008}, "language": "spanish", "review": "af af", "timestamp_created": 1693020303, "timestamp_updated": 1693020303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145030600": {"recommendationid": "145030600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346587239", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2538, "last_played": 1695263003}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game and definitely worth the 40 hours I put into it.

Well with the second one coming out I finally got around to it and it's... disappointing.\n\nTLDR: the platforming and parry are super finicky and end up turning the solid combat and beautiful aesthetic into an exercise in frustration.\n\nI beat the first boss/enemy handily and it felt pretty good; in general melee combat DOES feel pretty good! Except the parry is finicky. That's the word of the day in fact. My sword touching the enemy weapon isn't automatically a parry, instead it requires precision timing with no visible cue, and as such becomes unreliable. And with how little warning a lot of enemy attacks give, getting that timing down is frustrating at best. Especially because early on there's a type of ranged enemy that are constantly placed on tiny platforms you have to make several jumps to get to while they repeatedly throw tracking projectiles at you and you *don't have a block*. You have to parry them, which is, again, finicky. Sekiro succeeds at making the player parry everything because the visual *always* matches the timing. Blasphemous fails in my eyes because of the opposite.\n\nAlso hey, you know what's normal in a platformer? Jumping from rope to rope, or in this case ladder to ladder! You know what *isn't* normal in these cases? The ladders having itty bitty basically frame perfect hitboxes with large visuals! It makes it very confusing and frustrating to see the character in a place where they could very clearly grab the ladder and don't. I guess that's why it's normally ropes. That visual-gameplay dissonance was far more frustrating to me than the combat. It also extends to things like landing on platforms and the aforementioned parrying. In general the game tries to merge precision platforming with tough combat and its always the former that ruins it for me. Why does our character slide a few frames on stopping if you want me to be precise?\n\nSpikes are an instant death. Cool, whatever, platformer things. Except they go with the soulslike school of level design: dying sends you back to a checkpoint (which are fairly rare) and respawns all enemies. Lacking the third dimension of a dark souls game, enemies are rarely avoidable and attempting to do so is liable to land you in the incredibly common and immediately deadly aforementioned spikes. So you don't get to run back to where you died, you instead get to clear the entire area again, isn't that fun?\n\nApparently there's fast travel. I got annoyed and quit well before I unlocked it, and you can only upgrade at the main city. So if you want to use your currency you have to run back through every zone you've gone through so far to do so. You do get shortcuts back through these zones, but it's still a hell of a trek a lot of the time.\n\nIn summary: there's so many other games out there with better platforming and better quality of life. There's harder games if your goal is bragging rights. The only thing Blasphemous is unbeatable on is style and aesthetic. If you *really* love those about this game then sure play it. As for me, experiencing the gameplay actually made me like it a lot less.

But I have one major gripe with the game.\n\nI was replaying it for the new content, most of which I would only get to see in my NG+. The crux of the matter however is while you get to keep your Prayers/Relics/Beads/Mea Culpa upgrades, for whatever reason you are having your HP/Fervour/Knot/Flask upgrades be reset to 0 upon entering NG+. Wait, what? Why? It is completely unnecessary and it adds nothing to the experience except putting a tedious collect-a-thon in the way of wrapping up the actually meaningful content you didn't get to see the first time. NG+ is already considerably harder and has Penitences if you so desire. Why do I need to go through the whole game and collect all the upgrades I already found AGAIN before I can tackle the actual content I started NG+ for in the first place? No  Souls, Souls-like or basically any other game with NG+ would make such an unfun design decision.\n\nImagine in Elden Ring the developers randomly decide you keep your spells and spirit ashes, but you need to collect all the flask upgrades, recipe books and grind runes to level up your Vigor/HP and Mind/FP all over again from scratch in every NG+ cycle. Gee, that sounds like such a fun concept, I wonder why no one else ever tried this. \n\nAnd the thing is you NEED NG+ to experience all the new content (and to get the true ending, which you VERY likely don't get in NG since it is VERY missable).\n\nThese design decisions are completely killing my motivation to see the new content, because it is simply unnecessarily tedious to access. Make the DLC accessible in the first run and the true ending less missable like in Hollow Knight. Or just let me keep my stuff. Having both at once is just bad game design to me.

For example, beating the game unlocks a boss rush mode and new game+, but nothing tells you the boss rush mode is a boss rush mode unless you go through old patch notes, and I literally had to google search how to NG+ because I'm an idiot, but also it's a little vague. I'm cool with the lore and game mechanics being a little opaque, but I feel meta-mechanisms like the above should be clearer.\n\nAlso, wow when the game warns you that NG+ is significantly harder it is not joking. Not bad, but notable. This game tends to get noted as \"soulslike\", and while the base game didn't feel fully that way, the post-game definitely does.\n\nThere's some definite quirky-ness to the platforming. You can't grab a ledge unless you're lined up near-perfectly and facing the right way, if you're too close you won't grab it, where in most games there's not really a \"too close\". And ladders! You can't grab them unless you're lined up almost perfectly with the center. Again, once you know it, you adjust to it, but it's notable because I've never noticed similar things in other games. \n\nBoss fights are very memorable even when I found them easy. Hilariously, the hardest times I'd have were when I'd forget that basic mechanics like blocking existed. I looked up a youtube video at one point and stopped after 5 seconds feeling like an idiot.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone who really liked Hollow Knight or similar titles, it's a fun time, but if you don't like combat-heavy platformers, you'll probably not like this one either. Additionally, the Spanish Catholic influences are notable only because while I was never bothered, I can definitely understand why deeply religious people would find this off-putting or even offensive. Sort of a buyer beware there.\n\nAdditionally, minor spoiler, but I totally thought I was heading for the \"true\" ending, and in-game it seemed like I had done everything I had needed to, but then I got the bad ending? Primarily I think because the true ending was added in a post-game DLC and assumes you have gotten/know how to get the \"good\" ending as a basis.

But the more I played (and getting good), it's actually a great game. The combat is quite satisfying once you're used to it. The enemies and environment style is also very great looking. If I'm gonna rate just the content for the main game, it's a solid 7.5/10.\n\nIf I have to nitpick something that's not implemented well enough, I would say it's the platforming side quest (or just platforming in general). Although it's not a problem for most of the game because you can probably cheese it with some technique. BUT it's a different matter when talking about the Miriam's side quest. Simply put it's a timed platform challenge. And some levels had actually a moving platform that made you sit on it for a damn long time while it delivers you to a shooting fireballs. At that point it's not even a bullet hell anymore, it's just an HP endurance challenge. Why bother with a timer when you can't avoid a moving platform with 40 seconds of linear path (I don't actually counted it but feels like it). The platform foothold is also very weird, you can clip through the moving platform if you got hit by a fireball. Lastly is probably the lantern dash strike thing (idk what to call it) where the game never gave a tutorial on how to do it, and if you hit the lantern at exactly the handle of the sword it won't even register and you'll just fall to your death. I completed all of it, but didn't get the same sense of accomplishment like other platformers (give me achievement please).

Once again, the devs created a fantastic atmosphere with great audiovisuals, added superb world-building and wrote a slightly opaque but still very enjoyable story. Blasphemous is about pain and penance in a world founded on a distorted religion - and penance makes its way into every aspect of the game. Unfortunately, that includes the controls, the platforming challenges and the combat - I certainly had opportunity to repent a lot for my sins while I was grappling with a movement system that was neither precise nor fluent, a combat system where any mob could insta-kill you any time by pushing you off inconvenient ledges, and the huge amount of backtracking on a map that is in itself brilliant but needs lots of traversing as the game gives you so little clue to go on.\nIt's hard for me to recommend the game, and equally hard not to recommend. There's a lot of value in it, but there's too much time in it when it's simply not fun. Since I managed to atone my way through the world of Blasphemous, I'll give it a thumbs up, but my recommendation is to try the demo first.\n", "timestamp_created": 1692819583, "timestamp_updated": 1692819583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144876900": {"recommendationid": "144876900", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998717093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1694792121}, "language": "english", "review": "really nice game", "timestamp_created": 1692819402, "timestamp_updated": 1692819402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144876822": {"recommendationid": "144876822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264059121", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1692819184}, "language": "english", "review": "this is probably the worst metroidvania I've ever played. every level is designed by some sort of sadist that hates fun and wants people to be in pain.

An extremely solid Metroidvania with a beautiful art style, great music, and fluid gameplay. Tons of side quests and extra things on the side to keep you entertained throughout. New game plus and boss rush mode also help extend the play time. If I could describe the gameplay in one word it would be satisfying. The executions are brutal and fun to pull off. The combat is fluid and great. The enemies have great designs and all have different patterns to memorize. The bosses are incredible and are a blast to adapt and conquer. Their designs have a great warped monster feel that intimidate you. All areas of the combat and abilities have great depth and multitudes of options. Barely any complaints other than the game itself being somewhat vague in terms of gameplay and story. Be prepared to look up certain things  as there are a decent amount of stuff that gets overlooked in a first play through, but maybe that\u2019s where the beauty of multiple play throughs  come in. The bosses do seem to come out of nowhere to me and I would\u2019ve liked a little more build up, but that\u2019s just me. The atmosphere and world it tries to build up is intriguing and breathtaking  but they seem to give a lot of questions and it leaves a good bit up to the player for interpretation.  I wanted to know the backstory how everything happened and there was just times I felt I was not being shown as much as I wanted. And while the final boss is great both endings felt slightly underwhelming and too cryptic, which is a fitting word for the story in general. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys metroidvanias or a challenging video game with a great style. And while the story is a little too vague for my liking, the pros EASILY outweigh the cons. What\u2019s great is REALLY GREAT and the cons are really just tiny nitpicks that don\u2019t really dampen the experience a lot at all. For the price this game is a no-brainer for the enjoyment you\u2019ll get.

It's been so much fun, and I honestly prefer to play via keyboard and mouse but that's just my preference. \nArt is absolutely stunning. It fits the vibe they were going for perfectly. All monsters I've seen so far are all aesthetically pleasing to the eye and are scaled well difficulty wise. Difficulty scaling of my play through this far has been a breath of fresh air. It's hard, but not so hard that you can't get past it. It isn't too harsh on deaths either which was nice. The bosses I've fought so far have been difficult but not to where I had to give up the game. I'm currently stuck on an optional boss, but if I push myself I can beat her. I honestly think my favorite part about this game has to be the secrets and puzzles. While not being super ground breaking, I loved that some puzzles where placed in earlier areas of the game so then you come back to them, making many areas in the game re-playable which I really enjoyed. This game so far has made me really look forward to the upcoming sequel and you'll be sure I'm buying it once I have money lol.

Rather than guiding you with straightforward quest logs, the game weaves its story through items and hushed messages found on certain remains, akin to the approach in the Dark Souls series. The game's difficulty ranges from \"challenging but fair\" to \"highly demanding,\" a spectrum that I find incredibly satisfying. I remember struggling against one of the DLC bosses (whom I won't spoil by naming), initially leading to frustration. However, mastering the art of parrying turned the tides. The battle, albeit brief, became an immensely enjoyable experience, without needing to rely on overpowered tactics often showcased by YouTuber peasants for sloppy victories.\n\nUnlike in Metroid Fusion, defeating bosses doesn't directly grant upgrades for your gear or abilities. Instead, these enhancements are scattered throughout the world and some tied to indirect quests from various NPCs. The game's essence lies in exploration, making it a pivotal aspect for your progression. On the downside, there are a few drawbacks to mention. The roster of bosses is somewhat limited, and the act of conquering a boss doesn't yield a distinct reward. Furthermore, the array of enemies could use more variety. Completing the Miriam challenges or minigames can be vexing, and regrettably, the rewards post-completion are not particularly noteworthy but rather absent.\n\nIt's important to note that the game offers three distinct endings. Be cautious, as you could unintentionally prevent yourself from achieving one of these endings by entering a room linked to one of the final bosses, even if these bosses are not immediately visible upon moving to the next room. A word of advice: if you're aiming for the ending that necessitates possession of two in-game items, refrain from using the three-headed elevator until you've successfully obtained and placed these two items in their designated locations. I personally made the error of continuing my exploration, which unfortunately resulted in locking myself out of that specific ending.\n\nI encourage you to give this game a try; I can assure you that you'll likely find as much enjoyment in it as I did. No game is a \"masterpiece\", but this one was close to being one. I'm eagerly anticipating the release of the game's sequel, as I believe it holds the potential to build upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. \n\n----Pros-----\n- Dark souls + metroidvania. \n- Gloomy atmosphere (story and environment) \n- Hard Content\n- Superb Voice Acting (English and Spanish)\n- Smooth gameplay \n- beautiful artstyle\n- 3 endings, Endings are tightly affected by the *indirect* choices you make\n\n----Cons----\n\n- Poor mob variety\n- Not enough bosses\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1692579487, "timestamp_updated": 1694466638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144681955": {"recommendationid": "144681955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205033687", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3752, "last_played": 1692615417}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo la verdad, me lo compr\u00e9 hace un mes o as\u00ed y despu\u00e9s de haberlo platinado es un pedazo de juego.

So, I had my expectations high, and it delivered, the world of Blasphemous is horrifying and intriguing that it just makes you want to play more and find out more around this world. Characters, cutscenes, and Voice add more that it can make you play again, and the developers know and gives you more content to play around and achievements to achieve. \n\nFor the base game, it\u2019s an open-world, you are given quest locations that you can do in any order but certain quests can be missable, making you either load your previous save or create a whole new game, choices are permanent and sometimes the smallest actions can create a huge difference to how NPCs will end up, some only impacts the side quests but some can lock you out from achieving a certain ending. \n\nThe choices you make, doing side quests, collecting collectibles reward you. You can see [I] Albedo [/i] improve as you continue to help them, certain NPCs reward and/or improve your character making things easier than the trouble you went through made it easier for later. \n\nI highly suggest using an interactive map, tracking collectibles and guiding where they are, the map is huge, and you might get lost going where next or lose count on how far you\u2019ve progressed collecting. \n\nWith that said, with such a huge map, every time you enter a new area or approaching a boss, it felt foreboding because the enemies and bosses you\u2019ve went through were horrifying and grim that makes you say [I] \u201cWhat the fuck\u201d [/i] makes you more intrigued what this new area has in store for you. The music is amazing that you can feel how scary fighting against these enemies. \n\n[hr][/hr] \n[h2] DLCs / Extra Content [/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\nFor extra content or the DLCs in this game, they are certain DLCs that were more of a hit or miss to me. [I] Wounds of Evertide [/i] is an extra content which adds a lot in the game, and just makes the game all the better, the bosses, the enemies, the music, I couldn\u2019t forget how much fun I had fighting them and how many times I have died fighting them. \n\n[I] Strife & Ruin [/i] was the most infuriating moment I had in this entire game. Learning there was a collaboration with [I] Bloodstained [/i], I was expecting a playable character, an interesting boss fight but all it gave me was just LADDERS. Well, it\u2019s a Time Trial that mostly consists of ladders and spikes, and thanks the miracle that this is completely optional, that it is not needed to complete on getting 100% of the game because I quit pursuing this quest halfway through because on how much I hated it.  \n\nAnd the rewards seemed disappointing when I looked it up, all the trouble just to get a Prayer. \n\n[I] Stir of Dawn [/i] is the extra content I have yet to review, perhaps if I have the extra free time, I can rewrite this review and talk about this, but as far as I know, this is the New Game+ content of the game. \n\n[hr][/hr] \n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n[hr][/hr]\nOverall, it is one of the best Metroid-Vania games with lots of replayability and lots of challenges for you to complete.
