It follows the same structure , has the same core mechanics and provides fair challenge . I do have some pretty significant issues with it however , so let's get them out of the way first :\n\n1) No replay value . When you finish the main campaign once there is hardly anything else to do afterwards , besides maybe replay it on a higher difficulty , but even then it's just the same thing but enemies take less damage from you and there are no health drops . There are no other playable characters , nor any extra stages , and the challenges the game provides range from okay (Dr Light's trials) to borderline stupid (jump saver).\n\n2) It's too short . Really ? only 2 actual Wily Castle stages ? Thank god those are at least pretty fucking great (rare to see for a Wily castle !) . Well , except for the boss rush . Seriously game devs should stop implementing boss rushes to the games , it is one of the laziest ways i can think of to pad put runtime .\n\n3) The shop destroys any challenge the game can provide . Easy , play a stage once ( you don't even have to beat it , just game over) and I guarantee that you will have enough bolts for 5 E Tanks and whatever else . The drop rate of bolts is RIDICCULOUS , and I can't tell if it was intentional , or an oversight on the development team's behalf (It doesn't even change on Superhero mode !!) . If you want to play this game and actually be challenged , do not use the shop . Or even ...\n\n4) The Double Gear system . I know this sounds very controversial but honestly , I think the Double gear system , while good in itself , should have either been an unlockable on new game plus , or exclusive from the start to the easier modes . The speed Gear makes things a whole lot easier when it comes to platforming , and the power gear ... I actually don't really mind that one because powering your special weapons up is cool as Fuck . Thankfully there is a cooldown and you cant use it excessively , which saves it from being completely game breaking .\n\nMega Man 11 is a decent little game for old time fans of the classic series , and a pretty fantastic entry point for new fans . I know I sounded very negative towards it but trust me everything else that I have to say is praiseworthy at the very least . I think 30 dollars is a bit too much for what it's offering , but if you see a price drop absolutely get it .", "timestamp_created": 1700575284, "timestamp_updated": 1700575284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150523511": {"recommendationid": "150523511", "author": {"steamid": "76561199016817467", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 420, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1700751689}, "language": "english", "review": "Nostalgia ;)", "timestamp_created": 1700530268, "timestamp_updated": 1700530268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150518663": {"recommendationid": "150518663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388190991", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 260, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1700581177}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game, its giving metriod dread vibes", "timestamp_created": 1700522618, "timestamp_updated": 1700522618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150319633": {"recommendationid": "150319633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198437000351", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1700333176}, "language": "spanish", "review": "est\u00e1 bastante decente, entra en el top 5 mejores juegos de megaman cl\u00e1sico \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1700263229, "timestamp_updated": 1700263229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150304257": {"recommendationid": "150304257", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967164613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 270, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1700540685}, "language": "english", "review": "Eh.

It feels like an insult instead.\n\nThe art style looks unappealing and bland especially for a game which is only five years old, and especially considering the rest of the series at least looks good.\nThe music is hit-or-miss, when the rest of the series tends to have hit after hit after hit. (The Gear Fortress theme is good though)\nThe plot is bland and tries to pose moral questions with obvious answers while ignoring other actual moral dilemmas.\nThe voice acting is cheesy and campy but somehow isn't funny? I don't know, bad voice acting is funnier when it's from 1997.\nYou can't change your controls for accessing the pause menu (always P on keyboard) or the weapon select menu (always R on keyboard). I cannot figure out why.\n\nThese are all minor pickings compared to the gameplay, though. And the gameplay is tedious and mediocre, with boring & frustrating level gimmicks, confounding enemy placement, and barely used special weapons (aside from the Block Dropper).\nThe levels' lengths have been increased across the board, with each level's central gimmick being repeated multiple times throughout a level, and a midboss being in every level. This sucks. Checkpoints are fewer and further between than in classic Mega Man, and dying three times still sends you back to the very start. Even Mega Man 8, a mediocre game in its own right, had continue points to solve this issue! It makes the first few stages you pick very frustrating.\n\nAll-in-all, this feels like a much worse revival of classic Mega Man than 9 or 10 were, and I hope that a Mega Man 12 would learn from this game's mistakes.", "timestamp_created": 1699935380, "timestamp_updated": 1699935380, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149903841": {"recommendationid": "149903841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083460212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1695391301}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and nice you can play on easier difficulty.

No se pero a Capcom no hay quien los entienda, despu\u00e9s de ser Anunciado en 2017, finalmente en Octubre del 2018 sale a la venta Mega Man 11. [/b] [/code]\n\n[h2] HISTORIA [/h2]\n[code] [b] La Saga Cl\u00e1sica no es caracterizada por tener historias s\u00faper elaboradas y este juego no es la excepci\u00f3n, simplemente Light retomo el proyecto abandonado de Willy (el Doble Mega) para que Mega Man pudiese hacerle frente. Si bien no es la gran cosa me gusta que le de alguna profundidad a la existencia del Doble Mega, como dato este juego actu\u00e1 como una precuela del Mega Man 10 el cual acaba con la redenci\u00f3n de Willy dejando las curas del la Roboenza. [/b] [/code]\n\n[h2] JUGABILIDAD / MEC\u00c1NICAS [/h2]\n[code] [b] Con respecto a este apartado los controles se sienten muy frescos y tiene unos controles muy c\u00f3modos y se siente perfectamente la transici\u00f3n de un Mega Man Cl\u00e1sico a este que vendr\u00eda ser de una era \u201cModerna\u201d. Un gran Plus en este juego vendr\u00eda siendo el Doble Mega que nos permite tanto como ralentizar el tiempo (la Megavelocidad) o poder disparar ataques muy potentes con el Buster (la Megapotencia). Todo esto por tiempo Limitado debido a que al usarlo de manera prolongada se acaba sobre calentando y teniendo que esperar a que se enfri\u00e9 para poder volver a utilizar. Por otro lado tambi\u00e9n esta la Tienda que no permite comprar Vidas, Tanques de Energ\u00eda o Mejoras que nos permiten diversas cosas como: poder usar el Doble Mega por mas tiempo sin el Sobrecalentamiento,  que el Buster se recargue autom\u00e1ticamente, etc. [/b] [/code]\n\n[h2] GR\u00c1FICOS [/h2]\n[code] [b] A diferencia de sus antecesores Cl\u00e1sicos de 8 Bits este juego experimenta con un 3D nuevo que esta bastante innovador para la Saga y permite tener un estilo \u00fanico en la franquicia que se ve muy bien, este estilo Grafico hace recordar mucho al New S\u00faper Mario Bros sobre todo al de la Wii y los dos coinciden en siempre en sus Sagas Cl\u00e1sicas tener un estilo 8 Bits muy marcado y en que los dos pasaron a este 3D plataformero que se ve muy bien. [/b] [/code]\n\n[h2] PERSONAJES [/h2]\n[code] [b] El Juego aparte de traer a los t\u00edpicos como Light, Willy Mega Man y Roll, tambi\u00e9n trae los t\u00edpicos Robot Masters pero que en este caso en lugar de ser los t\u00edpicos Robot Masters que parec\u00edan humanos comunes disfrazados este juego nos trae unos personajes que se asemejan a los Mavericks de Mega Man X, cada uno con un dise\u00f1o \u00danico y Humanoide, junto a sus propias caracter\u00edsticas que combinan con sus habilidades y/o dise\u00f1o. Lamentablemente algunos personajes como Protoman o Bass quedaron descartados. [/b] [/code]\n\n[h2] NIVELES [/h2]\n[code] [b] Los Escenarios tienen un Dise\u00f1o y nivel de Detalle incre\u00edble Ambientando perfectamente el lugar a donde estas ubicado, los mejores podr\u00edan ser la Excavaci\u00f3n de Impact Man, el Parque de Diversiones de Blast Man o el Campamento de Torch Man, Cada uno se adecu\u00e1 muy bien al Personaje al que le pertenece cada Nivel y se ve Est\u00e9ticamente muy bien a donde esta Situado.

This game is nothing but a glorified rage inducer. It's fun to see the updated graphics on an original Megaman , and for the most part the game isn't all bad. The things I have to complain about are simple, but honestly make this game unplayable for me. Number one is the input latency that I experience in this game, I have tried at least five different controllers, some wireless, some wired, and still have issues with buttons reacting late to being pressed or being pressed and nothing happening at all. (This issue does not happen in any other games that I play.) The second thing is the inability to aim your blaster shots. How do you put that feature in a game (Megaman 10) that looks like it came out of the late 80s/early 90s, but can't put it in a modern looking and feeling game? The amount of times that I was on a ledge or conveyor belt and got knocked off to my death because an enemy was coming in from above me is idiotic. That shouldn't even be a concern. Third thing is level length and lack of checkpoints, the levels feel like they go on forever and have very little checkpoints, you want to make the game hard? Go ahead, but for the love of all that is holy, put in some checkpoints so I don't have to replay the same difficult part 800 times. Look, I get it, \"Megaman is supposed to be hard, it's supposed to make you rip your hair out and give you an ulcer. You just suck at it.\" But there is a difference between a challenging game, and one that was designed to make you throw your controller through your monitor, and this seems to be the latter.

It doesn't take better graphics to move a series forward, but this game doesn't need to be the best looking Mega Man game to also be the one that moves the series forward the most in terms of mechanics, while keeping the physics of the 8-bit games that people love so much. The gears actually add a lot to the gameplay and are essential for mastering the game, although everything in the game is possible without touching the gears, for those who are the tryest of tryhards (there isn't even an achievement for beating the game without the gears; the devs don't expect you to do it, despite having a laundry list of really difficult achievements like 9 and 10). Definitely master those gears and play the game a LOT before trying anything as dumb as not using them.\n\nThe multiple difficulty levels have much more depth and differences than 9 or 10's difficulty selection, and those, combined with the achievements you get for playing through the game in certain ways, incentivize multiple playthoughs, even across the same difficulty settings more than once.\n\nThe game also includes a multitude of bonus challenges, as well as time trials with online leaderboards, so there isn't really a shortage of content. \n\nYou can certainly wait for a sale (there have definitely been a few) but make sure to buy this game at some point to ensure the future of Mega Man. The people behind this game know what they are doing and the resulting product has very few flaws, probably the fewest of any of the classic Mega Man games, although how flawless a game is won't necessarily correlate to how much you like it, and that's just fine. You will probably enjoy this one a lot, regardless, if you like these games.\n\nJust a couple of quick tips: make sure your sound effects volume is set three notches below normal, the music is set to max, and the voice volume is left unchanged.

For instance, the lives system, the one-hit kills from spike traps and bottomless pits, the jumps that require near-pixel-perfect accuracy, etc. These were always fairly transparent ways to pad out the length of games that didn't really have a ton of content, but that was commonplace and acceptable in the 8 and 16-bit eras. These days, it just feels like the game is wasting my time.\n\nThe double gear system is a good addition, and opens up new gameplay opportunities and strategies.

Normal mode is very hard from a modern perspective, and you can't change difficulty without starting a new game, so make sure to choose wisely. [/b]\n\nFirst off, while this is not the first legacy Mega Man with a 2.5D aesthetic (8 did so too), this one succeeds much better in that regard. Visuals are clean, beautiful, and the numerous effects balance chaos and readability effectively. It also brings back most of the more advanced recurring mechanics from the series, including the slides and chargeable buster. The traditional 8 unique (for each game) special weapon upgrades come back as usual, and this time especially, look and feel powerful, impressive, varied.\n\nThe usual architecture of 8 stages to beat in a custom order, followed by the much longer final stage divided in parts, also comes back as usual, for better or worse (some stages feel much more difficult than others). The shop, only found in later games, is also there, with a surprisingly large arrays of items and upgrade parts, potentially making the difference between a ridiculously hard time and a trivial experience through a level.\n\nThe game offers 4 levels of difficulty right off the bat, making it way more accessible than most games in the series. Yet my experience was a bit so-so with its current implementation. Even though I had gone through the first 10 games (to be fair with the possibility to save at every checkpoint, as permitted within both collections), normal mode felt incredibly difficult, with the frustrating tendency of having one or few short, but wild difficulty spikes far in a very long stage, forcing you to redo the whole thing (whether the rest of it is easy, and thus gets boring quick, or not). \n\nIt doesn't help that the imperfect navigation system through narrows spaces (somehow, jumping through a small hole is way harder than it should be) makes a few areas like the moving wall of flames in the Torch Man stage feel like serious bs. I then tried the newcomer difficulty setting, which in turn felt too easy, despite a few challenging areas in Wily's fortress, assuming I wouldn't use plenty of items (should have gone with casual I suppose). Overall, I wish one could play casual, or even normal mode, without limited lives, as redoing full levels because of one random area bores me more than anything else. Being able to change difficulty without starting a new game would be nice too.\n\nOtherwise, assuming you don't replay stages multiple times, the game is relatively short. If, like me, you tend to prefer going through various games without replaying them much, the full 30USD price might seem a tad steep coming from a big studio. Regardless, the game is technically well made and all in all, fun to play. In fact, I feel it simply plays better than most other games in the series, at least from the perspective of someone who didn't grow up with them.\n\nThe music is chill, but forgettable. I didn't mind the voices at all neither. They aren't the absolute train-wreck which Mega Man 8's voice acting consisted of.\n\nIt's fun, pretty, well made, and it brings very fresh ideas on the table (notably the quite interesting double gear system). \n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1685504706, "timestamp_updated": 1685504821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139232442": {"recommendationid": "139232442", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961109000", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1685671882}, "language": "english", "review": "GUD", "timestamp_created": 1685391166, "timestamp_updated": 1685391166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139185949": {"recommendationid": "139185949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365542627", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1642452287}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si sos fan, si", "timestamp_created": 1685319635, "timestamp_updated": 1685319635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139054025": {"recommendationid": "139054025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146919324", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 235, "last_played": 1690731679}, "language": "english", "review": "A great next step for Megaman, 8 years after we got Megaman 10, 11 does not dissapoint in any category!\n\nAll 8 Robot Masters and their stages are absolutely stellar, same goes with the weapons, story, and just general gameplay.

Megaman promises Dr Light to get the robots back and sets off on an adventure. \n\nMegaman XI is a retro platformer which old style mechanics.\n\n[H1]The good[/H1]\nIt's great that tutorials are offered throughout the game and you can always go back to test out your weaponry and skills.\n\nThe retro music is nice - going back to the 1990 - 2000 :-).\n\nYou can select any of the levels from the start - it is not necessary to beat one boss or level before the other.\n\nAfter you have completed a level and beaten the boss you take their abilities. Then during the next level, you can use the beaten boss' abilities to beat the next boss. Part of the game revolves around finding out which boss to beat first so it can give you an advantage in the next level.\n\n[SPOILER]I found the following sequence to work best: Block, Acid, Impact, Bounch, Fuse, Tundra, Torch and Blast.[/SPOILER]\n\nThere are four difficulty levels and many challenges to replay the game. The levels aren't that long so if you feel like you want to replay it again the opportunity is there.\n\nThe levels are 2.5d with some of the bosses becoming 3d at times and making use of that. It looks OK and the graphics design is clean and crisp with an old-style flavour to it.\n\n[H1]The not so good[/H1]\nThe limited lives, sparsely spread-out checkpoints and instant killing spikes all feel punishing for no good reason other than to prolong the game. Dead Cells was brutal at first but always fair - I didn't feel Megaman is fair: it is limiting itself too much to a time long past and it should have adapted improvements of games that were released in the last decades. I mean we now we have Mario Odyssey and we didn't stay in the 8-bit era?\n\nMegaman relies on cheap mechanics to make things feel difficult but it is not working. The time stop and extra power feel poorly designed. There is no wall jumping, no double jump and no rolling. Then we have saving slots like we're playing SNES / NES and the worst of it: if you forget to use the save slot you will lose your progress as there is no autosave and the menu structure is poorly designed.\n\nShooting is limited to horizontal only except if you have a certain type of mega man - it's frustrating to get hit by an enemy from the top or bottom and you can't hit them. Then the basic powers are limited \u2013 so if you run out of energy there is no way to shoot or blast unless you find a refill. They are difficult to find. \n\nOn top of this all, we have particularly unfair mechanism like a wave of fire chasing you multiple times in a level, robots crushing you if you are not fast enough etc. It is not fun. \n\nThe physics and especially the jumping feels much like 1987 but times have evolved and going back to that mechanism after having played a game like Dead Cells or Ray Man Legends is a rough experience. It like you are on Jupiter or so and before you know you\u2019re back on the ground.\n\nThe levels are not continuous loading \u2013 so half way the game the next part has to be loaded. On modern systems this mechanic is no longer required so unless it was applied for retro reasons it is just not good. Then we have the enemies: if they are 1 pixel out of the screen, they are reloaded like Super Mario 1 - so in especially tedious levels you get hit by a missile that you may not be able to destroy, then you fall down and the enemies that you killed before are all there ready to have a shot at you with their auto aim. To make matters worse enemies will stun you when they hit you and, in many parts, they spawn continuously. \n\nBoss fights are - especially without proper basic dodge control - more about how much you can cheese them then skill. A boss might be super hard but then you switch to another form and five seconds later the fight is over. It feels like there is little balance and it makes all of it not interesting. \n\nThe story is completely forgettable and the voice acting is so poor. The whole acting feels it has the pace of an eighties anime: yes it was great back then but we would like a faster pace now. Also the samples  are poor quality \u2013 perhaps to relive the good old time? \n\nThe game is really short (normally that would be bad but considering all the negative in this case it is a good thing). At the end you have to fight all the bosses again, fight the final boss and that\u2019s it. There is little replay value.\n\n[H1]Bug and glitches[/H1]\nAfter launching the game, it is not possible to Alt-Tab back to desktop. \n\n[H1]The DLCs[/H1]\nThere are two DLCs - I only got the Wily Numbers: Instrumental Stage Tracks: it offers retro music to the stages and it's fine. \n\n[H1]Summary[/H1]\nIf you are looking for a retro game experience with retro game mechanics on a PC then Megaman XI might appeal to you - but then again why wouldn't you use an emulator and get a better experience? \n\nWe live in 2023 and games have thankfully evolved since Super Mario 1 came out. I just wish all the great improvements various devs came up with, were introduced in Megaman XI. The game is stuck in the past and I can't recommend it - it is tedious and boring. I pushed through to see if things would improve when I got more abilities but they don't. \n\nPlease do yourself a favour and if you are looking for a great platformer pick [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/]Dead Cells[/url] or [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/]Risk of Rain 2[/url] or [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/242550/Rayman_Legends/]Rayman Legends[/url].

I beat it on the Switch, but the PC version doesn't seem any different. It's just another classic series Mega Man game. The stage design is good, the graphics are good, the character design and overall art direction is good, the sound design is okay, the music is pretty good, and the voice acting is okay. But, given the game's content and short runtime, it's overall not really worth 30 dollars. It does, however, frequently go on sale for around 10, which I would say is definitely worth it. \n\nSo the game is good. Why am I leaving a negative review? Uh, I just personally don't like it. I feel like 10 was a wonderful leave-off for the classic series, having 3 playable characters and difficulties. Mega Man 10 is highly replayable and a preferable game in my opinion. I always thought that if they ever made another classic series Mega Man game, it would have to be very final.\n\nSo, with Mega Man 10 being so good, what do they do to try and top it? Well, they add a new gimmick. You can slow down time or buff up your buster shots with only a button press. It's difficult to get used to and unsatisfying to use. Yeah, I personally dislike the new gimmick. I've never really liked gimmicks like this in video games.\nThe game was designed so that you could beat it without using the gimmick but trying to play without it would be stupid since a lot of the stage design is designed around it.\n\nBosses have a berserk mode, this is another new thing in 11. I also dislike this. I think it would be okay if it didn't give them an entirely new health bar, but as it stands it's just frustrating and annoying to deal with -- because while the bosses are in this berserk mode I feel like all progress in this boss fight has halted because I have to deal with this new berserk mode. \n\nOkay now that I talked about what IS in this game, let me talk about what's NOT in it.\n\nThere aren't enough checkpoints. Only 3 checkpoints was fine in the NES games since the stages were short but the stages in this game are about twice the length. I appreciate difficult games but despise having to reset progress constantly. It's just not worth getting all the way to the boss and getting a game over and having to restart. It's actually very frustrating, having this happen. Moreso than in the NES games.\n\nHere is something only longtime fans will care about: Bass and Proto Man aren't in the game. I don't just mean as playable characters -- they aren't a part of this game at all. It's a damn shame because I love the robot trio. Mega Man, Proto Man, and Bass. They were always a pleasant sight to see. Proto Man with his whistle tune and helpful power-ups. Bass, with his cool theme song and awesome boss fights. They're just completely absent. Characters, that I believe, are iconic to the series, just gone. Like a Mario game without Luigi or Toad. Like a Sonic game without Tails or Knuckles. It's just a shame.\n\nOkay time to nitpick. 11 is a weird number. Couldn't they have just dropped the numbering system at this point? It makes people feel pressured to play the first 10 games before this one -- which is a lot and not everybody will want to do. Seeing how back-to-basics this plot is, not adding to any of the previous games in any way, the numbering isn't really necessary and just hinders its potential playerbase, I believe.\n\nThis just isn't a Mega Man game I would personally play over and over again like I would with Mega Man 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10. Give us a new Mega Man ZX game, I would play the hell out of that. A new Mega Man X would be good, too ... at least to wrap up the story with that series. Also the Gameboy games!

It does a wonderful job recreating the feel of the characters and environments of the best-looking entries of the series. But when it comes to the gameplay, the Double Gear system didn't do it for me and it often felt like the game tries to make up for frustrating levels by having you buy extra lives and energy tanks with the currency you earn by killing enemies. \n\nNow, I've got to admit: Mega Man 8 aside, I'm not much of a a fan of the main series. I highly value the motion-rich movesets from the X, Zero, and ZX games. Given that 11 is a main series game, I'd likely refrain from posting a review were it not for a bigger issue.

The game looks fantastic yet manages to retain the retro feel brought back by Mega Man 9 and 10.\n\n\n\nMEGA MAN 11's gimmick is the new DOUBLE GEAR SYSTEM.  The shoulder buttons allow you to activate either the SPEED GEAR - to slow the action down, or the POWER GEAR to double the impact of your weapons.  I found myself using the speed gear most of the time as the power gear often overwhelmed me.  Power gear charged shots pack a helluva recoil and can get you injured as easily as they damage the enemy.  Many puzzles are designed to require the Speed Gear over the power gear. \n\nMaking a return is the \"shop which lets you equip Mega Man with items and power ups that do everything from granting extra lives to extra energy/ammo - or even the most important BEAT.  He'll swoop in to save you from bottomless pits.  The first time I saw this in action in MM5 I was so elated.  However, why couldn't Rush Jet have been used for this?  There's also spike boot protectors which grant you a single use protection if you accidentally fall on insta-death spike traps.  One item: The BOLT CATCHER  allows you to collect more bolts during a stage which will help you reach currency levels allowing you to buy the two most expensive items, totaling 6000 bolts. Unfortunately, this can only be purchased on SATURDAY (the computer's clock regulates this).  There's also an ENERGY catcher  and a WEAPON ENERGY catcher that allow you to more frequently get energy cells or weapon cells.  These items can only be used one at a time, but in portions of the game where you can kill endlessly respawning enemies, you can quickly stock up.  \n\nThe enemies in this game are basically clones of thee very same enemies from the classic games, but they've been given more dialogue and personalities which they'll demonstrate shortly before you turn them to scrap metal. \n\nAs with any Mega Man game you must demonstrate mastery of the Boss weapons, Rush coil, Rush jet, and the Double Gear system.   Because you'll more than likely cheat by using online guides to tell you the appropriate boss order,  the game isn't as difficult as some of the classic games (MM3 was a nightmare by comparison).   Grinding for bolt currency will allow you to buy enough items/power ups to ensure that you'll be able to restore health or weapons while the boss enemies are no match for you.  You can replay stages to get more currency and approach the final stages completely maxed out.  Dr. Wily won't stand a chance. \n\nThe Music in-game really isn't as enjoyable as the memorable chip tunes from the NES.  MM1, 2, 3 and 4 had probably the best music in the entire series.  MM5 and 6 had a few good tracks while Mega Man 7 and 8 had mostly forgettable themes held afloat only by the SNES' higher fidelity, bass heavy presentation. \nMusic in Mega Man 9 and 10 returned to the chip tune style but offered far more imaginative themes which I thoroughly enjoyed.    Mega Man 11  has forgettable, yet momentarily catchy J-pop electronica which, while somewhat entertaining, loops itself into obscurity as most of the themes sound the same and lack distinctiveness. \n\nThe levels can sometimes be obnoxiously and frustratingly long.  Classic Mega Man games had stages that could be finished in fewer than 5 minutes.  Added to the difficulty  in NORMAL mode (or higher) and you could be facing much longer challenges - upwards of 20 minutes possibly.  I understand the developers wanted to \"give you more\", but they'd have done better offering you more thoughtful checkpoints.  Sometimes you'll die and be sent back way further than you want to be. If you manage to beat a mini-boss, that'll most likely be your main save point in a stage, but if you fall-short of him, or lose all your lives before reaching the Robot Master, you're going back to the beginning.  This can be a good thing in that you'll grind more bolt currency so you can buy more items to help you, but you must be wise about spending money or else you'll end up wasting it.  My strategy is to stock up on E-tanks and W-tanks while saving my Energy Tank for the ultimate battle with Wily at the very end.    An E-tank and W-tank combined are cheaper than a single M-Tank by a considerable margin.   \n\n\n\n\nI bought Mega Man 11 for $12 on STEAM sale and I earned that money back through Youtube superchats.  I don't think I'll find myself casually replaying this game as much as I am likely to replay Mega Man 1 or 2, but this is a must-have for Mega Man fans and anyone else with a taste for old school

One thing I must highlight is how accessible this entry is; You really make your own difficulty, not only with the new and shiny dual gear system, but with the equipment available.\n\n\"Finding too easy still?\", I'm pretty sure you can complete, at least every robot master, I haven't reach the final stages yet, without using the gears once and any equipment if you don't want to. \"Finding too difficult?\", stack restores, life, and make good use of slow down and you should be go to go. I can't understand if someone using all resources available to still find this game too difficult, I would suggest another game then. It's not this game's fault at all.\n\n\"Does it has some rough edges?\" Yes? It has some, but I feel it's nothing that can't be overlooked AND it brings a lot of nice innovations to the franchise. Other than the double gear system, and the adjustable difficulty, enemies have more clear attack patterns, bosses, oh the BOSSES! Has been a long time I felt the robot masters' fights were so intense!! It's a FIGHT now, not a push-over Spark Mandrill, AND they have second forms/ultimates that spice everything. It feels much more alive, which I didn't even think the series needed until I played it.\n\n\"Could it have better graphics?\" yea, sure. But for the innovation and animation it brings, I feel it's justified. It's finally in 3D after the last two entries that were 8-bits, so it needs to be praised for it. They did a very good job here. It could have been better, but they made a solid foundation.\n\nI guess the most pressing argument is, \"should you buy it full price?\" yea, I think so. That's the market price for 2D platformers and this has a smooth 3D coat on top. If you're a fan of 2D platformers or Mega Man, I believe getting with a discount is a no-brainer. You get a well nice thought-out that could just reuse the same beaten formula, but dared to not to.

When I looked up why, apparently the item is only available in the in-game store on Saturdays. WTF? WHY?? I don't know why developers do this sort of thing. But, screw you apparently if you start it on a Tuesday and want to play through without using an outside guide.\n\nOtherwise, it's mostly a great game. It's a big adjustment from prior Mega Man games in that the levels are really long, (but you still only get 2 extra lives) so you'll likely end up starting over a few times until you learn the levels (unless you get the item I mentioned - then you can just stock up on extra lives and E-tanks and save a ton of time).\n\nAlso, the music is boring which is a real crime for a Mega Man game.

But then I tried the full game and gosh, I'm impressed how fun it is. \n\nThis game adds the gimmick of double gear, which probably will never return. I can see Mega Man introducing new gimmick in every game to keep it fresh, would be fun. Anyway, double gear allows you to power up your moves or slow down time, but you can keep it up only for a limited time. If you're close to death you can activate both at once. A lot of mechanics on the stages revolve around you using your gears properly. Although many of those sections can be also beat without it.\n\nAt the beginning you'll probably use speed-up gear more, it's uses are more obvious. There are also some escape sequences, where you can't succeed without your speed-up (I think). But each weapon you unlock gets additional mode when used with power-up gear. So as you progress in the game the power gear gets more and more useful. There are many places you can make child's play by just using proper weapon + gear combo. Trying stuff out and getting hard boss killed in seconds is always a good feeling.\n\nThe weapons are... possibly the most fun ever in the series. This time, thanks to 3D graphics, you don't just change colors, but also get some different parts when you transform. Nice touch. Also, after getting a weapon you can freely experiment with it in training stage, to get the feel for it's uses. Couple this, with the fact that nearly all weapons are useful during stage traversal and you have a recipe for success. Also, using powered up version of the weapons doesn't seem to use more  energy, so you're free to go crazy.\n\nThis game has 4 difficulty levels. Difficulty levels are nothing new for mega man series, but in the past you often had a choice between insultingly easy and normal. Here you have very easy option for newcomers. Mode named casual, which increases your lives, checkpoints and decreases damage taken, but it doesn't really break the game, as easier modes often did. It feels very fun, and it also refills your energy if you die, which allows you to go all out. Normal difficulty is what you'd expect. But they've also added harder challenge difficulty. Nice.\n\nYou can collect bolts on the stage to purchase upgrades, which honestly are rather strong and useful. Most of them at least. There are also some secret ones to break the game, so you can have fun like that too.\n\nThe controls are superb. You can change your weapons quickly with triggers(gets less useful as you get further into the game), the menuses are good looking and work very smoothly. Rush is now accessed by pressing one of two dedicated buttons. Both modes of Rush share energy. I think it might have already been done in the past, but honestly I don't remember. But it all works out really well in this game.\n\nThe story is actually very good for classic mega man standards. More involved than I expected. Although remember that I probably already typed more words than the whole game uses.\n\nYou have some other goodies - time attacks, challenge modes, \"jump as little as possible\" and other game modifiers. There's also a gallery and some online rankings. Overall the game feels like a complete package.\n\nThey also had some nice attention to detail. You can only have 3 shots on the screen like in classic games. But there's also one place that they completely failed on. You don't fly trough the door with kick if you jump at them. This is unacceptable, please refund my money.\n\nSome of the stages feel a bit bland, I especially didn't like Block Man stage. That's the one used in demo, and might explain why my first impression of the game was so bad. Some of the stages are very inventive, with Bounce Man stage being my favorite. I'm not sure if there was ever anything like that in the past.\n\nI also like how weaknesses work in this game against bosses. For some bosses the same weapon that works against them is also good against the hazards on the stage, so you have to think where to use energy. Also, they put up a bit more fight than usual, even with the weakness. Some weaknesses aren't that obvious or simple to use. \n\nWhile I came to like the visuals, I never came to really like the music. It's inoffensive. But this is mega man game. The music should rock hard. There's nothing like Wily stage from MM2 here. \n\nAll things considered I'd like to see MM12, MMX9 or MZX3 or maybe some Zero spin-off. Use the same engine and deliver please.

Doing them buster only is way easier, at least it was for me. \n2. the double gear system is very lopsided, i felt no inclination to use the power gear because the speed gear is better in every way.\n3.  Unlocking upgrades is unintuitive and the upgrades themselves as a whole are ridiculously broken. I should never be able to carry 9 e-tanks at a time, especially given how cheap they are at the shop and how easy it is to grind bolts. Making speed gear even better and letting you use it more often is also insane. \n4. Wily stages were underwhelming. there are only 4 stages, 2 of those are the refights and the final boss, which leaves room for only 2 stages, neither of which were very memorable.

It's mediocre, and for a mega man game that isn't exactly good enough\n\nAll that being said, it's not terrible or anything, just woefully mediocre.

It is an action platformer where you platform through stages, defeat the stages boss and with the weapon you obtained through the boss, you take out other bosses who are weak to that weapon. It also has a new mechanic called gears. You have two gears called power and speed gears which the first one enhances your attacks and the second one slows down time. Gear system is fun to use and adds a really unique aspect to the game without disrupting the original formula. Stages are really fun to go through , boss designs are well made and the core gameplay is top notch as always. It is a really good Mega Man game although it is much easier than the rest of the games in my opinion and takes around 3.5 to 4 hours to complete the main game.

While this is a fun Mega Man title and very well animated, it is not a great Mega Man game. The main problem is that the game doesn't flow well from stage to stage. You can jump in on any level and beat the boss without using the skills you picked up along the way. There is no progressive development with your skills, in which you need to beat one boss in order to gain a skill that helps you beat another boss. I was destroying bosses with just my gun, and when I used the skills it annihilated them. Granted this wasn't on the hardest setting, but it still should have some thought development put into it. Second, the voice acting is absolutely horrible. HORRIBLE. Some of the worst voice acting I have ever heard in any game. Almost as if it was created for a 5 year old. And this ties into the story, because there is such a positive minded message focused with the whole double gear skill. Such as at the end of the game, Light has Auto use the Double Gear system to help fix the other robots, which would give a perfect opportunity to have Auto turn on Light and require Mega Man to beat him and destroy the Double Gear, but somehow the Double Gear is the savior of all humanity and robotity. Third, the music is weak af. Nothing like the good Mega Man titles. It doesn't come close to even attempting to compare to the good Mega Man music. And lastly, its so easy to gain points to buy skills... it would be nice if there was a little more grinding involved to be able to suit up with all your abilities, because once you get them you are nearly unstoppable.\n\nBut, like I said... the artwork and animation is amazing.

There are some quality of life improvements that I wish I had back in the NES days.  The enemies and levels are exceptionally creative, in this one.  It's fun from beginning to end.  I didn't use the \"Double Gear\" system all that much, but it's a nifty thing, if you're into special abilities.  All of the boss weapons are fun and useful in more than one way.  The bosses are satisfying to fight.  The story is about what you'd expect from a Mega Man game; the game is fun without it, and the story (such as it is) just kind of exists in the background.  Since the actual gameplay is so fun, I don't see anything wrong with skipping all the cutscenes.\n\nThere are a number of optional \"challenge\" levels you can do, but they weren't to my liking; you might like them better, if you're the type of player who likes to play a game until you can do everything perfectly.\n\nThe one thing that I would consider a negative, albeit a small one, is that the main game is only about 4 hours long.  It's about what a classic NES Mega Man takes to play, so it isn't a big deal; but unless you can get the game for cheap, I would suggest waiting until whatever it costs is worth 4 hours of core gameplay.  In 1990, this game would have sold for $50 on a contemporary console, but today, in the current market, it's a \"less than $10 game\", IMHO.  It's a lot of fun, so don't let that deter you; just make sure you feel that you're getting your money's worth.  Of course, if you want to play all the challenges, and play on different difficulties, that would make it much more than a 4 hour game.  For me, one playthrough of the main game scratched the itch, so I don't feel the need to do all the optional stuff.  YMMV.\n\nOverall, this is a fine addition to the Mega Man series--arguably one of the best--and I'm delighted that new Mega Man games are being made.

Not really perfect, but it's fine for the most part. I'll list some of the points that come into mind for this one.\nThe good:\n- Superhero(Hardest) mode is available right from the get go: It should be like this on every game on existance.\n- Great controls in general: You won't have problems with them.\n- Level and boss designs: Fun levels, fun bosses. The bosses designs are some of the best in the series.\n- Art style(2.5D is well done in this game, which is rare).\n- Voice acting: Not cringe, finally!\nThe BAD:\n- Running animation: It's just bad and it will bother you for a while.\n- Music: It's a big part of the series, but on this title the OST is just underwhelming for the most part. It has some bangers here and there tho(Stage Select,Blast,Fuse and Wily are the highlights for me).\n- The double gear system: Really fun when the bosses use it, but such a bad mechanic for the player. I didn't feel like using it at all and the gameplay would be better without it even existing.\n- The part system: I have mixed feelings for this one. Some are fine and I like them, others are just boring. The store is also lame and you can't buy more than one item at a time.\n- Graphic settings: A 2018 title with resolution, AA and V-Sync on the options. I guess because it's Mega Man they decided to not give a fuck. However it's underwhelming even for a game like this.\n- Extras: Just boring. Didn't feel like doing any of them. I finished the game and I'll just let it rust on my library.\nRating: A solid 7/10 for a solid title.

This game is different from other Mega Man games because it is now an upgrade in graphics to the latest technology. It also follows the previous games, a little too closely at times, in terms of the playability factor. There are the same amount of villains and levels as basically any other Mega Man game, which I think by now, this roster needs to be expanded because the game can be completed in a relatively short amount of time. However, the levels are all unique and have different challenges, and the game is extremely creative in how it is planned out. There are no real flaws I can report in the game or bugs. It is extremely fun as usual, especially since it is brought up to date, and contrary to what people say in other reviews, the music is fun and some of it is a newer-sounding soundtrack, while some of the soundtrack is more classic-sounding Mega Man music for the old-schoolers. I appreciate the different difficulties added to the game and the gear system, however, I think much more needs to be added to really make this series shine more. Also, it has been many years since this game came out, and there is no sequel to Mega Man 11 yet, so I am not sure what the delays are because they should keep up the momentum and not let it become another game that only comes out once in awhile and lose popularity. It is obvious, from what I have read online, that the sales of the game did well for a later Mega Man game, and it sent the message to the creators that another follow-up to the Mega Man 11 game would be lucrative. However, with this game's series, it's time for a complete refresh and not just graphically because obviously that is where they have made the most improvements to the gameplay. The format should have other types of levels in the game to give more replay value because the challenges with leaderboards offered are very difficult with no option to add on parts to Mega Man. You also can only play as one character on this game. Considering the original creator of Mega Man is no longer producing this game, it was pretty close to its original material. I think they have the right team assembled, but now, let's take Mega Man to the next level and bring it back to blockbuster status.

Otherwise, I generally cannot recommend it.\n\nThis is the 11th game in the classic series. There was an 8-year gap between it and Mega Man 10. There are also three Mega Man subseries with sidescrolling action like the classic series (X, Zero, ZX) that haven't had anything since [b][i]2007[/i][/b]. They have had more than enough time to practically [i]perfect[/i] the simplified classic series formula, and they made it fall way too short.\n\n#1: The level design is largely noninteractive and uninspired, and the robot master weapon selection is an accomplice to this. Stages have very few gimmicks to mix up the gameplay, and the gimmicks that [i]are[/i] there are mostly surface-level and shallow like wind or giant death walls chasing you. No bold takes at changing up control or movement like e.g. the shmup-like sections in Mega Man 8 (or 3 if you count the forced Rush Jet sections). You generally just walk from point A to B with really the only true obstacles to give you trouble being pits and spikes (which insta-kill you). There are no alternate routes, and there are really no ways to approach screens in different ways other than completely cheesing platforming challenges with Rush (or Pile Driver, the only robot master weapon that actually changes the platforming) or hitting out-of-reach enemies with weapons that have different ranges. Consider Mega Man 7 where weapons actually have effects on the surrounding stage like lighting trees on fire, powering devices, or freezing lava, oftentimes revealing alternate paths. Consider Mega Man 9 where Concrete Shot and Tornado Blow can interact with the stage like that [i]and[/i] help you with regular platforming, too, by giving you footholds or temporarily lowered gravity. All this game has is an aerial dash with Pile Driver and freezing Torch Man's stage's giant death walls. That's it.\n\n#2: The game is pathetically short. Look, I'm not saying we need 69 robot masters and 420 castles, but this is [b][i]THE[/i][/b] shortest game in the classic series -- honestly, possibly in the entire [i][b]FRANCHISE[/b][/i]. Once you beat up the 8 robot masters, there are only really 2 Wily levels. In Wily 3, the section leading up to refights is [i]one[/i] screen. Finally, in Wily 4, the section leading up to the final boss is practically just an extremely slow and boring elevator ride (with the really weird decision to make it slowly throw you into spikes if you don't just guess that you're supposed to drop down the giant gaping void below you). Beyond just the lack of levels, there is extremely little replay value. Although they have their share of problems, Mega Man 6, 7, 8, and & Bass all have powerups and stage design that incentivize you to explore and/or replay levels -- experience alternate routes, find secrets, try [i]actually[/i] interesting and unique powerups that significantly change gameplay, etc. Heck, & Bass, 9, and 10 let you even play as different characters. This game has absolutely none of that. Even [i]Mega Man Powered Up[/i] the [i][b]PSP[/b][/i] remake of the original Mega Man is better about this...\n\n#3: The shop system is unintuitive and annoying. There are many items you have to [i][b]UNLOCK[/b][/i] before you can buy them -- [i]every single playthrough,[/i] mind you -- and the unlock conditions range from arbitrary time-wasters to [i][b]incentives[/b][/i] to play badly. And of course, none of the conditions are actually told to you in-game. Want to upgrade Speed Gear? Just sit in one place and spam it on and off over and over first. Want to buy consumable Pierce Protectors that prevent one spike death each? Die to spikes [i][b]FIVE[/b][/i] times first. Absolutely unholy system. Seriously, never do this again.\n\n#4: The special weapons are few and mediocre. Look, this weapon set is one of the most balanced in the classic series, but some of them feel [i][b]EXTREMELY[/b][/i] irritating to use because they [i][b]CONSTANTLY[/b][/i] halt your movement. I can understand why they did it for Tundra Storm (this game's screen-clearer) or Scramble Thunder (since it can help you shoot enemies below you before you land on them), but you [i][b]CANNOT[/b][/i] justify Acid Barrier or Chain Blast needing that crap. Speaking of Chain Blast, why does the [i]one[/i] special weapon that incentives you to spam many shots in quick succession have a [i][b]SHOT COOLDOWN?[/b][/i] Pile Driver is the only one to really impact [strike](haha, Impact Man)[/strike] platforming, and Bounce Ball is just completely lazy and chaotic -- just hit wherever the hell eventually if you're patient enough. [i][b]NONE[/b][/i] of the weapons have different functionality depending on how you continue to hold the fire button or press arrow keys post-shot -- with the only exception really being manually detonating Chain Blast. The only other way to vary up weapons' functionality is Power Gear, which upgrades them in typically linear and lazy ways; they generally just do more damage or shoot a few more of the same projectiles as before. By the way, don't forget Mega Man 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 all have more weapons than the usual 8 you get from robot masters -- including Mega Man 4 if you count Balloon and Wire.\n\n#5: The visuals and audio do [i][b]NOT[/b][/i] give good, responsive feedback compared to previous games. It is generally hard to tell when I have i-frames or bosses have i-frames. It's even hard to tell if minibosses are actually taking damage or if everything is just dinging off of them, especially with weapons like Blazing Torch or Scramble Thunder.\n\nNow, I will certainly give props to improvements where due. Not having the game pause every time you pick up health or ammo is nice. The difficulty select is nice. Being able to access the shop during the Wily Castle is nice. And whenever it isn't impacting gameplay negatively (#5 above), the visuals are pretty nice. I appreciate the gear system for being [i]something[/i] new to the classic series, even if I think it's ultimately a bit shallow. But none of this counterbalances the fact that the game is short and bland. There are other sidescrolling platforming games with tighter design, more creativity, and more content -- including other classic series Mega Man games, both official and [i]unofficial[/i] (try Rockman 4 Minus Infinity). And they generally cost less than $30, too.\n\nI hope Capcom continues to try to defibrillate the franchise, but this is was a weird start, especially after an 8 year break.\n\n[spoiler]I hope nobody says there [i]wasn't[/i] an 8-year pause between Mega Man 10 and Mega Man 11 because of Mega Man X DiVE. It's a fuckin' [i]gacha[/i] game.

The awesome head-banging music, the sharp crisp graphics and anything that makes the classic Mega Man series great is done near-perfectly in this version. Although Megaman/Rockman himself has changed compared to his superior 8-bit self, it\u2019s just enough differentiation without looking like the awkwardly large Mega Man 7 sprite. Meanwhile, the story itself also looks like one of the best coming from the Mega Man games (Not spoiling it here, but it\u2019s really well thought out!).\n\nThe overall difficulty maintains what makes the Mega Man/Rockman series a great game: Although it will appear really challenging on the 1st few playthroughs, after that combined with memorizing the patterns it becomes a really fun romp in the park! It may take a while to get through the levels, even on Casual mode, but the overall experience is really satisfying after you complete it! If you\u2019re new to the series and/or you\u2019re not yet ready for the big challenge there\u2019s Newcomer mode. It makes things a lot easier (The infamous insta-KO spikes simply giving you damage instead, for example.) so newcomers can get used to the game\u2019s systems and mechanics, while the pros can have a chance to decompress and have a good time! Speaking of which, like Mega Man 9 you can collect screws (the in-game currency) to buy whatever items and upgrades that will make things easier for you to traverse the levels.\n\nThere is also a collection of challenges for those who want to look beyond the main game, replays and leaderboards included, and achievement hunters will have a nice time overall.\n\nSo far, the only major problem I see in this game is a huge jump in difficulty between the Newcomer and Casual difficulty. Otherwise, this is a great Mega Man installment to look into, along with 9, 5, 2 and, IMO, 1!\n\n\n\n\nHey, I can still recommend Mega Man 1, even when I\u2019m one of those oddballs who thought it was a cakewalk!!

It's Mega Man, modernized. The stages look great, the graphics are colorful, the music is super catchy, every weapon is a delight to use, the bosses are interesting, and now you actually have a compelling reason to use the boss weapons in-stage. \n\nThe Double Gear system is also fun and intuitive. You can temporarily increase your power or your speed (or both!) at the expense of burning out afterward if you overload. Note that the bosses have this system too. Things are a lot more strategic this time around. It's a definite improvement on the old Mega Man formula.\n\nHowever, if that isn't your bag, you can technically still play it safe by just stocking up on E-tanks and spamming everyone to death. The game does let you do that if that's all you want. The \"Superhero mode\" (hard mode) is also a little broken in that you end up with more bolts (currency) than you know what to do with, which ends up making the game easier due to your ability to max out all your tanks and equipment each stage. Some may see all these \"easy-making\" workarounds as a plus, while others may see it as a flaw in trying to be too accommodating -- an unwillingness to enforce a particular style of gameplay/difficulty.\n\nFor you achievement hunters out there, this will take maybe 4+ playthroughs. I did a Normal-mode run for most of the game-related achievements, a Casual-mode run for the no-item + buster-only achievements, a Superhero-mode run, and a Normal-mode sub-60 speedrun. At least one of these runs needs to have no game-overs if you want to snag that achievement too. There are also extra challenges for earning medals, including a rather difficult 30-stage gauntlet (Dr. Light's Trial).\n\nI enjoyed this game a lot, and it inspires a lot of confidence in the future of the series.

The game sorta feels like a classic megaman, but it also doesn't feel like a true megaman at all. The controls are slightly more floaty and less precise, just a tiny little bit. But that's huge on a serie that always had the most responsive and precise controls ever. Levels are much longer than they used to and they feel more of a slog to me when compared to the 8 bit classics. To continue on the same theme, the music feels sorta like the old classic tunes, just a thousand times more bland and less memorable. The new bullet time mechanic and I just don't jive and I can't force myself to use it.

It came after a long drought of games in the series, several cases of what felt like Capcom backstabbing fans with cancelations, all culminating with Inafune leaving the company in disgust and teasing fans with the soon-to-be PR train wreck known as Mighty No. 9. In that context, plus the fact that the previous two entries were 8-bit throwbacks, it's understandable why people were hyped when this was announced. Everything pointed to it being a true return to form, and bringing the classic series up to speed with modern technology. Does it live up to that hype though?\n\nThis game finally breaks the trend of Wily totally not being the villain at the start and leaves him as the unquestionable perpetrator from the beginning. Furthermore, it actually touches on the series backstory a bit: it begins with a flashback to Wily and Light's younger years as colleagues and reveals the straw that breaks the camel's back that caused Wily to swear off their partnership. Further, the piece of this backstory serves as the stepping stone for the most major change in gameplay, which I'll get to in a minute. The game is also fully voice acted too, and thankfully it's quite competently done in contrast to previous English voice acting in this series.\n\nMega Man 11 does the same formula you know at this point: eight robot master stages, each gives you a new weapon that another is weak to, and then the Wily castle. The biggest thing you will notice right away though is the brand new visual overhaul. After two 8-bit throwbacks, it's refreshing to see a modernization again. The game also brings back the charged Mega Buster and sliding, two things notably absent from 9 and 10, so that is also welcome.\n\nRegarding the major change I mentioned earlier, that comes in the form of the Double Gear system. In addition the usual utilities you begin with, this ability lets you either slow down time or make your weapons more powerful for a limited time frame. If you let either run too long though, it will overheat and you will need to let it fully recharge before using it again. The two abilities share the same meter. Personally, I found the slow down mechanic to be a real life saver, but the power mechanic I thought was a bit redundant. The slow down mechanic already lets you tear through enemies with much less effort with just the Mega Buster, so I didn't see much need to use the power gear. It does give the robot master weapons a secondary more powerful ability though, for what that is worth.\n\nThe game also has a few other nice quality of life improvements, but one of the best ones in my opinion was that Rush Coil and Rush Jet are now called with specific buttons instead of having to switch to them, which was super convenient. As with the last several games, you also have a shop system that allows you to buy extra lives and energy tanks between levels, as well as purchase upgrades such as automatically charging your buster or reducing damage knock back. Best of all, you get the opportunity to try every weapon you get right after you receive it without having to worry about draining energy, which I can't believe none of the other games thought to do this before.\n\nUnfortunately, the game hangs on to other old tropes a little too hard. Namely, there is still a lives system in this game. Why? There are so many better and more fair ways to make the game challenging than this. I wouldn't have minded as much, except one, they still aren't reset to 3 if you finish a level with less than that (effectively meaning you'll need to game over before trying the next level), and two, the levels in this game are way too dang long. They're long enough that many have two checkpoints instead of just one that the past games had. Further, they often tend to have at least one cheap area that requires trial and error to effectively get past, like a jump totally surrounded in spikes.\n\nAll that said, when the game is good, it's a lot of fun. The new gear system adds a lot of unexpected depth to the game and the levels are generally designed well. The weapon roster is also quite good and balanced; most weapons feel like an extension on your utilities rather than being meant to replace your Mega Buster, which is exactly as it should be.

I used to think that 8-bit graphics was the only way to do Mega Man justice, but this game feels and looks like the perfect evolution to \"modern\" graphics. It doesn't have that annoying cartoon feel (complete with child voice acting) like Mega Man 8 did. The 2.5D is perfect. We saw what happened when they tried to switch to 3D platforming with a certain infamous \"X\" game years ago, so I'm glad they didn't try to go that route again. Unfortunately, the music is not up to Mega Man standards, but then again, the bar was set pretty high by previous Mega Man games so it didn't really bother me.\n\nPlay control is nice and tight, as it should be for any platformer. I recommend using an 8BitDo controller because they have a D-pad that perfectly recreates that of an old NES/SNES controller which is way better than the D-pad you get nowadays on controllers, imo.\n\nThe \"Double Gear\" system introduced in this game is a cool idea that allows you to temporarily increase your weapon power or slow down time and react quicker. Like all Mega Man games, the difficulty varies quite a bit based on the order you do the stages and how you use the weapons. Speed Gear is a huge benefit when used in the right situations, and understanding how/when to use various other weapons makes a big difference too. For example: you can use Tundra Man's weapon to freeze the firewall that chases you in Torch Man's stage). Not knowing the best order to do the stages and how/when to take advantage of Speed Gear can make the game seem much more difficult than it actually is for newcomers. Also, the item shop makes a world of difference. There's also 4 different difficulty modes.\n\nOther than the music, my only gripe about the game is that it's a little too short. The Wily fortress in this one only has 2 full stages before the robot master rematches. The game does have an extensive challenge mode if you're into that, but I wish the base game was a little longer. Gone are the days of having 2 fortresses with 3-4 stages each, sadly. Plus there no items to collect in each stage (the items are all in the shop), so you don't have a reason to go back to stages you've already beaten.\n\n...Also, it's way past time they retired Yellow Devil. It's become one of the biggest Mega Man cliches.\n\nPROS:\nGraphics look great\nPlay control is tight\nSpeed Gear is very useful and innovative (for a Mega Man game, at least)\nWell balanced difficulty for experienced Mega Man players\nExtensive item shop that makes it easier for new Mega Man players\n\nCONS:\nMusic doesn't live up to Mega Man standards\nThe base game is a little short\nThey still haven't used my \"Buttplug Man\" idea", "timestamp_created": 1629779821, "timestamp_updated": 1629801956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502188205718994141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98058153": {"recommendationid": "98058153", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963155484", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1647982177}, "language": "english", "review": "By god is the music awful.\nMakes my ears bleed.

Players with enough skill can clear the game without ever using it.\n+ The robot master designs are good, not as simple as the older games in the series but still less detailed than 8 and Megaman & Bass' designs. Mega Man himself is given a subtle redesign, taller than the 8-bit design, shorter than 32-bit design and more in line with his Smash Bros. look.\n+ Putting Rush on Y and B and bringing over X7 and X8's right stick weapon change makes it easier to avoid having to pause the game to switch abilities.\n+ The robot master designs are good, successfully finding a middle ground between the simplistic designs of the NES era and the complicated designs of 8 and Megaman & Bass.\n+ All of the weapons are distinct and useful in different situations, ecouraging you to use them instead of just relying on the charged buster shot.\n\nYMMV:\n\n/ The Wily Castle is much shorter than other games in the series have been. For one, there's only one castle in this game and it only has two real stages before sending you into the boss rush and final confrontation with Wily.

On the downside, that means you have no more terrible cutscenes to laugh at like in Mega Man 8.\n\nCons:\n\n- The soundtrack is underwhelming and unmemorable. Mega Man games are often remembered for their music, and unfortunately the ball was dropped here.\n\nTime to beat: \n\nIt took me four hours to beat the game's main mode on the first playthrough.

Capcom wanted to introduce this series to a new audience after so many years without a sequel, so they kept the character list limited to the Dr. Light family. I honestly applaud them for at least titling the game Mega Man 11 instead of ditching the numbering sytem entirely. \n\nWhether or not we see another 8+ year gap in between this game and Mega Man 12 remains to be seen. This game sold well for Mega Man standards and is currently the third best selling game in the entire series, including spin-offs. What we do know is that this game is a perfect foundation for another modern Mega Man game, and I would love to see one just like this. I know that the industry has changed and pumping out sequels that are very similar to each other wouldn't work anymore. Mega Man 11 through Mega Man 16 in the same vein as Mega Man 1 through 6, all being based on the same foundation with incredibly similar structure, is never going to happen. And that honestly makes me sad. The Double Gear System mechanic in this game could easily be replaced by a similar gimmick in Mega Man 12 and that would make the game different enough for me to purchase it. My favorite part about these games is the robot masters and the Wily Castle bosses. These characters give each of the Classic Mega Man games it's identity. Even though they all follow that same structure, they all feel different to me because of the characters and boss characters.\n\nCapcom doesn't have to reinvent the wheel for Mega Man 12. This game is proof of that. Let's hope they don't turn it into a gacha game for your phone like they did with Mega Man X.", "timestamp_created": 1627694801, "timestamp_updated": 1627694801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624707400798797607", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96662605": {"recommendationid": "96662605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285019849", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1255, "last_played": 1627692563}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Aqu\u00e9l que se dice amante del bombardero azul, no debe dejar este t\u00edtulo de lado,  excelente juego!!", "timestamp_created": 1627693113, "timestamp_updated": 1627693113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96645749": {"recommendationid": "96645749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002601586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3717, "last_played": 1627666410}, "language": "english", "review": "I recently finished playing through Mega Man 1-11 and I can say that 11 is one of the stand-outs.

I liked however how they made them an element that cannot be abused much and gave them a cooldown, but still, i could just toggle the power gear off and on everytime i wanted to shoot since most of the time i just kept dodging so i would put this as a grey opinion.\n\nThe Challenge mode, as said before, is filled with about 5 hours of content, as you progress in the story mode, you will also gain the special weapons and be able to use them in the challenge mode, this makes almost 70% of the challenges easy to go through, although i haven't unlocked everything, i really wished they added a second version of the challenges where you're locked out of the weapons, especially against the bosses. Still, it's a fun mode.\n\nDesign-wise this game is far superior than the rest of the franchise when it comes to the additions of quality of life options, such as the ability of loading your save file in the middle of a progress, which is super useful if you are going for a no death run achievement, and the new ability to select special weapons from the right stick is super RAD!\n\nThe soundtrack is memorable, for the most part. one thing i hated is that the wily castle had only one soundtrack as i got used to playing the level from the old games with a different soundtrack in each 1 or 2 levels.\n\nFinally, do i recommend this game ? absolutely yes to everyone, but the full price doesn't justify the amount of content that you get. i bought it for the sale price so i'm okay with it. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1621604106, "timestamp_updated": 1625511741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581065177917480469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92320295": {"recommendationid": "92320295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155230110", "num_games_owned": 733, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 924, "last_played": 1621782100}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks very hard at first, like \"mega man on steroids\" hard, but actually it's quite the oposite.\nIn fact you can totaly cheese it if you use properly the new \"gear\" system, and you can even overcheese it if you farm for lives and Ecans/WeaponCans thanks to the in-game shop menu.", "timestamp_created": 1621537042, "timestamp_updated": 1621555634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92299792": {"recommendationid": "92299792", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978019044", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 360, "last_played": 1661052471}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just SUCH a good Megaman game.

Also makes all time attacks and alikes for this stage even more frustrating when you can't beat it simply because you're stuck at one of those\n- there is an item in the shop which is only unlockable when you log in on a saturday .... lol? what? why? that's just stupid design\n- the two most powerful items in the game are unlocked post game (\"NG+\"), which would be fine, it's just that there is nothing to go for with them. The hardest achievements have to be done on the first playthrough or are in challenge mode, for which these upgrades are not available so there really isn't much to do with them. Instead of all those (in my opinion mainly unnecessary) time attack challenges I think they should really really really have made some kinda NG+ \"challenge\" or whatever where these upgrades actually show some value\n\nI think the game itself is fun, but they ruin the player experience with too much stuff that they put in which is not really fun to play ... there's always gonna be a speedrun/no damage run community for these kinda games but I really think any game should be designed so casual players can get 100% if they try hard enough without devoting half of their lifes to it. And like I said these kinda challenges make ~90% of your playtime if you want to go for 100% and are really frustrating by design, since it's basically always screw up once -> okay restart from scratch, plus they mostly feel pretty similar...

I used it at one point of the game only. The strong attack mode is fun but you can beat the game completely without it. One thing I didnt like was that the controls were strange. I couldnt go into the menu with my controller. I had to use the keyboard to do it (also to pause the game). There was no setting for menu in the control options. Same with the \"back\" button to cancel the weapon-demo mode or the button to access the options or the item shop. It wasnt too much of a problem though unless I needed an E-can quickly.

Despite its looks it's not that much easier than the older games. The game has a gimmick that involves slowing down time with a gauge.

As you play you'll realize where using it makes the most sense. And since it refills overtime you can't rely on it all the time so you're forced to use it only when you need it.\n\nThe only thing that's kinda subpar is the music but that's because the previous games have such great music and it's a high standard to live up to.

If you're going to buy it, I'd recommend getting it on sale.\n\nAlthough all the elements of a classic Mega Man game are here, I felt it missed the mark. I got it on release and after a few stages put it down and didn't pick it back up until recently (when I bought it on Switch). There is a story, which is nice, but it doesn't draw you in, and the game is more frustrating than previous entries. \n\nThe main flaw I had was the level design. It works like classic Mega Man games, where it shows you what you're in for, then slowly ramps it up, which is great. Unfortunately, levels seem to be longer than previous entries which I found more of an irritation than a benefit. The classic Mega Man difficulty is here, but so are several cheap death areas. With the lengthened levels, checkpoints aren't located in great places and you'll find yourself having to grind out longer areas of a stages several times before getting to the part that kills you. With certain levels, I found myself more frustrated than challenged. \n\nThe other issue I had was the shop. I feel like the game was balanced around the shop rather than the shop being an added feature you can ignore. Enemies appear to drop less items and instead drop more screws (shop currency). If you need some health, it's rare you'll find it by killing an enemy, instead you'll need to rely on Energy Tanks. Of which you can hold 9. And cost almost nothing compared to the screws that drop. Same thing goes with life and weapon energy. I tried to avoid the shop at first, because I felt it made the game too easy, but without Energy Tanks, I literally couldn't refill my life. \n\nThen we have the Double Gear System. It's a neat concept, and I like that the bosses have it, but it kind of ruined the Mega Man feel for me. They're basically cheat codes you can activate mid-game. Boss too tough? Slow it down. Lava flow chasing you? Slow it down. Too many enemies? Slow it down. I tried my best not to use it because it felt way too powerful. In a perfect world, I feel like you should get it only after defeating all the robot masters. That way you can use it against Wily and see its affects in the boss rush, unfortunately, that wasn't the case. \n\nAlthough I did like the graphics, I felt Mega Man's sprite was terrible. I much prefer the sprites from 7 or 8. I also can't remember a single song from this game. Not even the intro became stuck in my head. If you leave a Mega Man game without humming a tune, something is wrong. \n\nOverall, I'm happy I played it, but probably won't touch it again and instead stick with any other entries.", "timestamp_created": 1617909667, "timestamp_updated": 1617909667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89905606": {"recommendationid": "89905606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021551803", "num_games_owned": 5240, "num_reviews": 172, "playtime_forever": 1533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1533, "last_played": 1601924544}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Mega Man 11[/h1]\n[i]Rock em, sock em[/i]\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\nAfter an eight year absence, I am happy to report that [b]Mega Man 11[/b] succeeds, but there are a few caveats. Let's be honest: it wouldn't take much for [b]Mega Man 11[/b] to not succeed in the eyes of the fans when you are springboarding off 2003's lacklustre, dead-in-it's tracks [b]Mega Man X7[/b] (which tried to transition the series into 3D with disastrous results), which only ended up taking the franchise to new levels of low that nearly saw the blue bomber tumble into notoriety with fans himself. The follow-up, [b]Mega Man X8[/b], didn't do much to elevate the franchise out of the muck within which it had found itself, with X8 never rising above mediocre. Many of us fans thought Mega Man was on his way to the retirement village to be sunsetted by Capcom after the throwback [b]Mega Man 10[/b] was released in 2010 feeling like a cash-in. The years long radio silence after that only further made it seem like Capcom had no clear path forward for the blue bomber and  fans started to wonder whether the franchise was finally on life support.\n\nI will admit, as a huge fan of the late eighties originals of which [b]Mega Man 2[/b] is the high point, the return announcement in 2017 did catch me off guard. With creator Keiji Inafune now having moved on from Capcom, how could Capcom ever do without Inafune guiding the series back to life? Although we would soon all learn that Inafune's best days were probably behind him too after [b]Mighty No. 9[/b] failed to emerge successfully from under the shackles of the [b]Mega Man[/b] franchise, ending up an inferior product in almost every conceivable\u00a0way from from mascot, to robot bosses, to world, and finally extended to the villain. The next question was with Inafune gone, could Capcom ever make the blue bomber relevant again?\n\nSadly, no as it seems like the days of Mega Man's relevance have long passed and are now assigned to history for keeping. When we first met him in 1987, platformers were the rock star's of gaming. They sold systems by\u00a0virtue\u00a0of the mascot alone\u00a0 Now you would be lucky to find a big publisher willing to fund one outside of Nintendo. While the genre did have a bit of a resurgence in the early noughties when they went 3D and became gobbledegook collectathons, its mostly fallen to indie studios to keep the genre alive and quite frankly they have been doing a sterling job. Just look at some of the crazy and wonderful things with the genre they have been doing ([b]Super Meat Boy[/b] and [b]Celeste[/b] are classic examples of this). \n\nIn many ways it kind of feels like the game succeeds by virtue of simply existing, especially for us fans starved of his presence but Capcom does a fairly good job of taking the series and modernising some of its mechanics but that is where it stops because the rest of the formula remains untouched from the original game - a blueprint that has been subsequently adhered to rigidly throughout the long running series. This legacy design that the series keeps on insisting including is now starting to feel more than a little archaic, ensuring there are very little to no surprises with each new release. It's at the point now where its become the franchises Achilles heel. You won't find any platforming moments of brilliance here, like the kinds of stuff on display in [b]Celeste[/b] or [b]Hollow Knight[/b]. It plays it very safe and is clearly made for long standing fans of the series, as if Capcom knew it was treading on thin ice with them.\n\nIf you were never much of a fan of the series, then [b]Mega Man 11[/b] is going to do little, if anything, to turn that around. Another thing I must mention is that it is also insanely hard, and that is probably going to drive a lot of people away. I had to drop it from normal difficulty (which is advised for mainstays of the series which I consider myself) to easy mode and I still struggled like mad to make headway with it.\u00a0The first three Mega Man games are considered to be amongst the hardest games ever created, yet I could clear [b]Mega Man 1/2[/b] and [b]Mega Man 3[/b] in a single sitting back in the day while typing text messages to my dentist and doing tax calculations for my tax return. Yet here I couldn't even get through a single level of repeated trying in the five or so hours I banged my head against the normal difficulty before resigning myself to the fact that I must now officially be an old fart who has to play on baby settings.\n\nAs a fan I appreciate that Capcom has brought [b]Mega Man[/b] back from the dead and I appreciate the graphical update to modern HD graphics. Mega Man has never looked more clearer although I would love to see the series return back to its pixel roots, BUT when I say pixel, I am speaking along the lines of the gorgeous indie platform Kings and Queens of our current era ([b]Celeste[/b], [b]Blasphemous[/b] or even better yet [b]Children of Morta[/b] which has these incredibly highly detailed pixel counts that look utterly gorgeous) and not the 8-bit revival of [b]Mega Man 10[/b].\u00a0\n\nThe reality here is that [b]Mega Man 11[/b] is not the return to form sequel many would have you believe. It's enjoyable but it's also not enjoyable to play in equal measure and is\u00a0not one of his better adventures. I also found the eight Dr. Wily robots you need to defeat a little underwhelming from a mechanics and design standpoint. If Capcom is to continue [b]Mega Man[/b]'s adventures into the future, then I certainly hope they look into the history of the most celebrated and beloved platformers of our modern era that have all, almost exclusively, sprung from the indie scene because that is where [b]Mega Man[/b]'s true innovation and salvation lies. There is no point in trying to revive his\u00a0best days. Let history keep record of those.\n\n[h1]One word or phrase to sum up the experience[/h1]\n[i]For the fans[/i]\n\n[h1]Performance/Bug related incidents[/h1]\n[i]None, should run easily on most hardware as the game is not demanding on CPU or GPU.[/i]\n\n[h1]Similar to games[/h1]\n[i][b]Mega Man 2[/b], [b]Celeste[/b], [b]Might No. 9[/b][/i]\n\n[h1]Rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606[/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869453510", "timestamp_created": 1617824850, "timestamp_updated": 1617982531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804161548614501953", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89676526": {"recommendationid": "89676526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262342802", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1686916574}, "language": "english", "review": "i liked it and enjoyed it.", "timestamp_created": 1617505984, "timestamp_updated": 1617505984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89591984": {"recommendationid": "89591984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013790215", "num_games_owned": 1295, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1617222333}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good move of a classic into the modern game era.

"language": "english", "review": "After so many modern disappointments (Looking at you, Mighty No 9), this was a refreshing return to Classic Megaman \u00e0 la MM4. The art is updated but doesn't feel gimmicky; it's true to what you loved about that era of MM. Although I love MM 2 and respect the way 9 and 10 threw back to the first 2 games in the franchise, Eleven is doing something different. If you like being able to charge the Megabuster and slide, this is the game for you! \n\nLet's face it, if you love Megaman, you are not that into novelty. The appeal of the game is about the comfort of familiar enemies and style of play. \"Oh. Wily's at it again!\"  Eight bosses, a skull castle and a boss rush and probably a \"Oh-you-defeated-me--NOT!\" fakeout and you're done. The franchise at its best is about conservative refinement over time. There is also something delightful about seeing familiar enemies like the Bubble Bats/ Battons, the beloved Metalls--practically the series' mascot--(and many, many others) with a fresh coat of pixels. \n\nAs one review points out, the first screen of every level provides an especially atmospheric introduction to the stage. I would add that this is carried through to boss and mini-boss arenas, with backgrounds that give the 2D arena a sense of depth and place. This reminds me of some of the great background art in MMX, which I remember as being really exciting at the time. Although the explosion effects are a bit amped up in 11, I need to stress that the game just doesn't feel like the X series--without dashes and wall-gripping, your player doesn't move through levels the same way-- and I appreciate the distinction.\n\nThis makes the gear system is an interesting twist. I think it adds to the game in a way that is fun and feels natural. Because it's baked into the storyline so thoroughly, it feels like it might be unique to this game, but I would be happy to play more games that take advantage of it. \n\nMy only real complaint is that the game does lag a bit on my system, which makes me joke that I'm in \"Speed Gear\" more of the time than I'd expected. Honestly, if you hate the gear system, you can play the entire game without it. My first playthrough only utilized it a couple of times, and I actually beat the game before I realized I could how to activate Double-Gear. It's been fun to use it on replays. I really appreciate how the game feels challenging, but the power-ups and difficulty levels make it appropriate for a wide range of players to enjoy. \n\nBoss designs are fun and just varied enough from the other games. The sprites for MM are rendered with more complexity (more keyframes) and more variation than a simple recolor. In the past, the games have struggled to figure out how to deal with Items/Rush and I feel like they have come home now by assigning him dedicated buttons. Yes, I do accidentally activate Rush from time to time, but this is a minor inconvenience compared to digging through a menu. The game also uses the right joy stick to let you quickly swap weapons (center-press to quickly get back to the Megabuster). If you liked using the bumpers to quick-swap weapons in the X-series, you will quickly get into this.  \n\nI would go so far as to say that this is has replaced MM2 as my favorite classic MM game.", "timestamp_created": 1611182834, "timestamp_updated": 1611182834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84995444": {"recommendationid": "84995444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239221802", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1582443031}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't really say much that hasn't already been said.\nIf you're a fan of the series, get it.

Before I go on and gush about the gameplay, I HAVE to make it clear that the music in this game is just such an unbelievably egregious misstep for a Megaman game that it's hard to believe none of the developers realized that \"Hey..this doesn't really sound like, or anywhere near on par with the Megaman series musical legacy, does it?\" So yeah, in terms of what I've come to love about the franchise: looks, gameplay, and music, Megaman 11 is really missing a third of the pie right off the bat.\n\nOK, let's ignore that unbelievably ridiculous oversight and get to the gameplay! It is AMAZING. Megaman games tend to shine more and more as you continue to play and Megaman 11 is a perfect example of this. As I became more experienced with the general movement and unique tools this game offers, the masterful level design really started to become apparent. It's almost difficult to describe to anyone who hasn't played it, but areas that may have first appeared tricky or time-consuming begin to reveal themselves as crazy-well thought out streamlined areas with multiple different solutions depending on your strategy/weapons. This has been a hallmark of the series since it began and is absolutely present here. One of the most exciting aspects of this game is the double-gear system; no, not the idea that you can use it, but that idea you can not use it. I had never considered that this gimmicky feeling system could be the key to level designs that easily rival the classic releases in-terms of difficulty, but playing through this game without using the double-gear system is an amazing experience that doesn't pull any punches. It's hard to overstate how awesomely difficult this game is to play through without use of double-gear and it really highlights the already very impressive level design all the more when it works just as well without using the main advertised gimmick. It ends up being a perfect way to keep the difficulty fans like myself want while also allowing newer players to jump in and have fun firing gigantic mega-buster blasts ('cause who doesn't want to do that?!).\n\nWhile the graphics aren't quite as colorful as I'd like them, the designs of enemies and other characters are so on-point that I actually have some new favorite adorable enemies and found myself not noticing most of the issues I initially had on first reveal. In general, the graphics definitely hold up and didn't end up detracting from my experience.\n\nTo sum things up, if it weren't for the incredibly lackluster music, I'd be giving this game a 9 or 10 out of 10, but even with one of the most disappointing soundtracks in the series, I still found myself absolutely loving playing through this game and was always excited to jump back in and play levels again and again...and again and-etc. Just, please...improve the music!", "timestamp_created": 1610300871, "timestamp_updated": 1610300871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84409288": {"recommendationid": "84409288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162551974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 264, "last_played": 1610423881}, "language": "english", "review": "Special weapons are really good in this game.", "timestamp_created": 1610258230, "timestamp_updated": 1610258230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84407598": {"recommendationid": "84407598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121255043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1617926145}, "language": "english", "review": "Great addition to the Mega Man series.

"review": "This is a fantastic refresh of the Mega Man franchise from the NES days. I really enjoy the updated visuals and solid \"classic\" Mega Man gameplay. It took a minute to my controller-button reflexes back after 25 or so years, but I got there eventually! Normal difficulty was a nice challenge for me, having not played any of these games in so long. Being able to buy and stock up power ups definitely made it a lot easier. Bosses are fun and have just enough of a backstory to stay interesting. I appreciate the fact that Tundra Man was into figure skating. Nice!\n\nReplaying all the bosses in Wily's Fortress did not disappoint.\n\nGear system was interesting. It was not a core part of my play style, but it definitely came in handy in specific circumstances, e.g. advancing death wall segments. If you care to, this game can be as easy or hard as you want it to be. I think there's something here for everyone who enjoyed a Mega Man back in the '90s. I can also see this being a fun platformer for those new to the series.\n\nVoice acting was a nice \"modern\" inclusion. I set the audio to Japanese and subtitles to English. I prefer to play games with voices in their \"native\" language.\n\nI got this game on sale, but regular price is not so bad. I paid fifty bux for Mega Man 6 for the NES in 1994. Adjusting for inflation, that's about eighty-eight bux today.

It's great, even bosses have access to this system. I love it. \n\n[b] Nitpicks [/b]\nAs ridiculously polished and refined the Megaman formula is at this point there are definitely nitpicks. Artifacts of by gone eras that still haunt the Megaman games that I feel like we can leave behind. \nBlasphemous I know, but hear me out. \n\n-Respawning enemies? In 2020!?\nIn the old days this made some amount of sense as memory size was limited and the whole stage was never loaded in one go. So in side scrolling sections you could always respawn enemies endlessly as long as you allowed the enemy trigger to reenter the screen over and over again.\nWhy is this still a thing?! ;D\nI feel like Capcom is just raking in the nostalgia with this one. \n\n-Limit jumps, jumps that require very few pixels of error.\n When a Gap is almost exactly as long as Megaman's jump, while enemies are abound mind you. That can just get frustrating.... but what if this was a jump over a deathdrop.... OR A PIT OF SPIKES??!!?\nThat's really classic Megaman at its worst. I hate it, I hate dying to it, I hate restarting the whole blasting stage because of it. Aaahhhh!!\nAt least there's a store now that gives you a bird to save you and that saves you when you fall into spikes.... tho most of the time the bird drops me into the abyss anyway.... like 3 times in a row until i'm out of birds.... just kill me now.... ;D\n\n-While we're on the subject... FUCKING SPIKES!\nIs this really necessary? One hit kill to spikes? I mean since Megaman 1 on the gameboy we all purposely jumped into an enemy just go get a damage boost to walk past the spikes right?\nIf you tell me you never done that You're lying mister ;D\nFrom a Game Design Standpoint, this is a bug that needs fixing imho. \n\n-The whole continue situation is wonky... I can't quite remember where it came from. \nIn MM11 you always start with 5 lives. But when you beat a stage with 1 life left you can start the next stage with... that remaining 1 life. Then you can kick your butt down a cliff to get your 5 lives that you deserve, comawn ;D \nI really don't understand this one, just give us our lives man. \n\n-Another thought I have, but this gets really into changing a core aspect of the Megaman formula. \nWhat if... enemies and projectiles could NOT pass through walls...... \nWhat do you guys think? Too crazy?\nI think this would make less exploits possible, cause literally no enemy is out of fire range with these transdimensional walls everywhere that allow everything to pass through. \nThis would allow for new kinds of enemy and level design. I would dig it. \n\nBut ye, Awesome Game. A tad short maybe, but there's challenges too so. You can spend a lot of hours with this. \n", "timestamp_created": 1605580249, "timestamp_updated": 1605580249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503510534763336182", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79320358": {"recommendationid": "79320358", "author": {"steamid": "76561199074053726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 321, "last_played": 1655921325}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Good", "timestamp_created": 1605464462, "timestamp_updated": 1605464462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79233601": {"recommendationid": "79233601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352064801", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1608431793}, "language": "english", "review": "The Game is very good", "timestamp_created": 1605329658, "timestamp_updated": 1605329658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79134848": {"recommendationid": "79134848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087318204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1606079474}, "language": "english", "review": "The difficulty of this Mega Man was just too much for me.

A masterfully crafted, gorgeous gameplay experience from start to finish that manages to be original by introducing the new \"Double Gear\" speed/power mechanic while still remaining true to the series. Impressive design, direction, and presentation with great voice acting, a ton of character, wonderful bosses, and some of the most diverse and well-rounded weapons in the series. Just a solid entry to the series all around and a great action platformer. Lastly, the game introduces a new quick-select option for weapons and it really ups the ante for speedruns while making blasting through levels feel smooth and organic no matter how aggressively someone is playing.\n\nIf you're a Mega Man veteran, Superhero difficulty feels great and the standard difficulty is on par with that of other games in the series. There are more casual-friendly difficulties too, making the game a lot more approachable to newcomers than previous iterations. The game also includes a wide array of fun optional challenges much like those in the Legacy Collections. This includes replay sharing, making the leaderboards actually meaningful (and also educational when trying to improve). \n\nIn terms of the technical side of things, the game is well optimized. Never had any frame drops at 4k with everything maxed. Very smooth. Never encountered any bugs but the new mechanic does have a quirk to it where depending on how/when we activate the gears, we may be unable to jump for a few frames. Mildly annoying at first until realizing what's happening, then it just becomes an understandable game rule. \n\nThis is a must have for Mega Man fans. Action platformer fans should strongly consider this. This is also likely the best game for players to start on if they're completely new to the series. If you're the kind of person who appreciates Mega Man for its gameplay, it's worth it at full price. If you're the kind of person who's done with a game after they beat it on any difficulty, you may want to wait for a sale as much of the value comes from replaying/mastering the game and doing the achievements and challenges.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1604135312, "timestamp_updated": 1604135312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665394365787506104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78419565": {"recommendationid": "78419565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036247599", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1604090575}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is very fun and it definitely plays like the old ones, except that now it provides new mechanics with the double gear, changing heavily how you can approach the battles.

Some new mechanics were added to the game, which enhances the gameplay, making it more fun. Even with all the alterations, the game still feels the same as its predecessors. Even the cinematics have the same vibe as of the old game, but it\u2019s definitely an improvement. The showcase of the double gear mechanism was a risky transit, as it might have influenced the former mega man players that have built muscle memory, but surprisingly it doesn\u2019t ruin the fun and appends more to it. This game will act as a foundation for new mega man games because of the extension of new controls.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay:[/b][/h1]\nGameplay starts with a great cinematic, which will establish a connection between you and the game\u2019s story. There are no extra options to choose from, either play the game or just quit. You will be given nine stages to clear, with your preferred difficulty. Don\u2019t worry if this is your first mega man game as there\u2019s an option to play with infinite lives. But that doesn\u2019t signify that it will be super easy as there still will be a hurdle because unlimited lives only respawn you on a checkpoint, which implies, you still have to clear it. You can choose any stage clearance order as there is no restriction. Every completed level will give you an enemy\u2019s weapon that you can switch anytime at any level. With all the old controls of jump, fire, and slide, it also adds a new concept of the double gear system, which gives you the option to slow time or fire multiple shots. You might think slowing time might ruin the challenge, but actually, it doesn\u2019t. The game is still challenging and do-able at the same time. To truly experience a challenge, you can play with the default number of lives or can use \u201cextra powers\u201d that are available in the shop. All mega man lovers will enjoy this one.\n\n[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1]\nEven shifting to a 2.5D game, brilliant work done in keeping the touch of its predecessors. The graphics look wondrous. The colors are vibrant and balance the entire scene significantly. You will observe a lot of detailing and additional elements like falling off a crane, underwater propulsions during the levels. Your character won\u2019t get saturated with the background view, as it's intelligently made. There are no options available to change graphic settings, making everyone see the equivalent quality of design. The game runs smoothly on low rigs, making it popular among gamers. Converting an 8-Bit game is pretty tricky because you might lose the intensity the game had before, but mega man is an exception, as the game has only improved in this aspect.\n\n[h1][b]Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Pros-[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Challenging and do-able\n    [*]Great visuals\n    [*]Easy to learn controls\n    [*]Double gear mechanism added to game\n    [*]Affordable price even being a licensed product\n    [*]Wide range of age playability \n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons-[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Short story\n    [*]Problems with save data\n    [*]Hidden areas are removed, which was a fun aspect in old series\n    [*]Shop seems pointless \n    [*]Bosses are not challenging\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b] Miscellaneous Information:[/b][/h1]\n[b]Extra modes-[/b]\n\n[table]\n   [tr]\n      [th]Modes [/th]\n      [th]Description[/th]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Challenges [/td]\n        [td]Prove your skills on challenging special stages!

Overall, the game is fun and a good starter for non-mega man fans. The gameplay is short but fun. It offers a vigorous proportion of challenge and do-ability.

Years after 10, it was an astonishing surprise that the new entry would mark a return to the modern day. And what a return the game is. Mega Man 11 is a masterclass in gameplay and mechanics in it's respective classic series.\n\nThe overall feel of the game is just like how it is like its predecessors: tight and responsive. Jumping, shooting, and sliding all feel incredible and do not suffer any sort of input delay whatsoever.\n\nWeapons: A largely contested discussion for many players, all the weapons have a vast amount of utility in the stages and not be restricted to use as robot master weaknesses. Scramble Thunder is a reliable ground-hunting weapon that can destroy. Block Dropper can hit enemies from a distance and anything from above. No matter the situation, there are multiple answers to a problem that gives Mega Man 11 that love and care which makes every new playthrough different.\n\nDouble Gear System: The Double Gear System is 11's special gimmick that allows the player a choice decision of the Power Gear and the Speed Gear. While the game encourages players to make use of the Double Gear, these are not required to complete the game as all the stages are completely possible without them. Undeniably though, the utility of the gears boosts Mega Man's potential greatly. Power Gear gives extra power, boosting weapons; Speed Gear slows down Mega Man and his environment. A special item from the shop in the game can even prevent Mega Man from slowing himself down.\n\nDifficulty: It goes without saying that 11 is a hard game and may require 2 hours to complete for a new player. Checkpoints are sparse throughout the stages and because this game has a life system, getting a game over is punishing, pushing a player back to the start. The sparse checkpoints apply towards Normal and Superhero mode, but Newcomer and Casual gives a casual player more checkpoints. Even with checkpoints, quick observation and strong patience is greatly advised to make it through this game.\n\nMy honest opinion: love it!", "timestamp_created": 1601439707, "timestamp_updated": 1601439707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76788485": {"recommendationid": "76788485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198449739103", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1662780984}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful.", "timestamp_created": 1601424640, "timestamp_updated": 1601424640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76693712": {"recommendationid": "76693712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025003668", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1602030620}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Las etapas son las complicadas, los jefes valen verga :D", "timestamp_created": 1601265185, "timestamp_updated": 1601265185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76660611": {"recommendationid": "76660611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198827801069", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1604802939}, "language": "english", "review": "very good, but i need megaman X9", "timestamp_created": 1601217565, "timestamp_updated": 1601217565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710592210292816162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75932994": {"recommendationid": "75932994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838897166", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1594439434}, "language": "english", "review": "The blue bomber is back in action, better than ever!\n\nAfter it's journey back to the retro 8-bit days with 9 and 10, Mega Man 11 offers a refreshing new look both in visuals and gameplay mechanics.

It's not the best Mega Man game ever (especially when you start to consider the X, ZX, and Zero series) but it is worth the price by far. It's a return to form for the Blue Bomber, with tight controls and excellent platforming. The level design is strong, the visuals are great, the music is good too. Where it falls flat is not in poor design, it's simply that the older games were just stronger performers, for the most part. The music is good, but not nearly as good as, say, Mega Man 2. The game lacks Mega Man X's verticality and speed, but if I were to just compare it to the mainline Mega Man series, then the game is good, but not stand-out from the originals. The Double Gear system, which is new to the series, is fun, but not really game-changing. I found myself forgetting I had it as an option for much of the game, and when I did start to regularly incorporate it, I found myself relying almost exclusively on the Speed gear, using the Power Gear in a few select scenarios. \n\nAll that being said, it is very much a Mega Man game. Not a spin-off, not a spiritual successor, and not some cheap cash-grab with Mega's face plastered on it. If you enjoyed the old Mega Man games, you'll enjoy this too and I would highly recommend getting this entry. If you've never played a Mega Man game before, this game might be a great place to start, with it's modernized gameplay (like the power select wheel) and it's adjustable difficulty options.

The music is well-composed but limited in its variability and duration, presumably just because that's how the old games were. All of these things combine into a noticeably dated experience with cheap, artificial difficulty where most of the game is dedicated to avoiding gameplay as much as possible.

The team played every single Mega Man title prior to developing the game, including Mega Man X6 and X7. The cancelled Mega Man games in the early 2010s were due to Inafune leaving the company, and not out of spite, but because they felt they couldn't make any games without him. And Bad Box Art Mega Man in Tekken X Street Fighter? He was supposed to be just a funny inclusion - he was in development before all the games were cancelled. Bad timing. Why do I bring all this up? Just to dispel any rumors or speculation you may have heard over the years. \n\nDid the team succeed without Inafune? I think so. Mega Man 11 is your standard classic Mega Man game; 8 robot masters, you get a new weapon after beating a stage, etc. What it adds this time to differentiate itself from the previous entries, aside from the new visual style, is the double gear system. Despite the game's marketing, the double gear system is not made to appeal to newcommers, it was made to push what the designers could throw at the player. I could sort of compare the system to the chainsaw in Doom Eternal, you can beat the game without using it, but you are seriously handicapping yourself. \n\nThe game is hard no doubt, but not as hard as Mega Man 9 (edit: doesn't mean I don't love Mega Man 9 though) or Mega Man and Bass thankfully. I suggest you start on Casual for your first playthrough regardless if you're new or not. Normal is doable, but it can be a bit frustrating since they've reduced the number of checkpoints per stage on that difficulty. I understand increasing damage taken and less starting lives. Checkpoints; why? And in about half the stages in the game, there is at least one obstacle that makes me grit my teeth like the last section in Tundra Man's stage or the \"V\" spike formation in Acid Man's. Luckily, the shop from Mega Man 7 returns so you can stock up on items and new perks between stages to make your game much easier. Be sure to use your gears and special weapons as well. \n\ntl;dr - a solid entry in the Mega Man series. Hard, but doable as long as you use the gears and benefits offered.

Formulaic, but fun. It's classic Mega Man that fans have to come to expect and love. After 10 mainline games and way too many spin-offs what new things does the Blue Bomber bring to the table? Frankly, not a lot. The biggest innovation (and selling point) is the \"Double Gear\" system. Essentially, it's a power-up which allows for Mega Man to either slow down time or increase the power on his weapons. However, if your health is low enough you can combine the gears together (yay...) While I did find this addition to be useful (mainly, the time gear); I think that it overall subtracted from the experience. It makes the game too easy and predictable. The difficulty of entire platforming segments is completely negated when you just slow down time and pass all the enemies. Bosses suffer from the gears as well. Each boss has their standard form, but will morph using the gears during battle. Most of the time they become incredibly fast which forces you to just slow down time. This leads to very similar-feeling boss fights. If you do happen to have problems with a boss, the shop is readily stocked with E-Tanks, W-Tanks, extra lives, etc. Because of this, the challenge in the game resides solely in the levels. Be forewarned, that the levels in this game are extremely long. Other reviewers have mentioned this and it is very much true. I feel like I could complete 2-3 levels from the NES games before I beat one level in Mega Man 11. They also got stingy with the checkpoints for some reason. I could go on and on about things that I didn't like such as the synth-heavy soundtrack (but that might be due to the fact that I'm spoiled by the Mega Man X OSTs). There were also a bunch of minor nitpicks I had with the game (voice acting, lip-syncing). Despite this, the formula just works. The power-ups are fun and the game is short enough to complete in one sitting; although I wouldn't recommend it. If you're a Mega-Man veteran, I'd say it's worth a purchase during a Steam Sale. However, if you've never played a game in the series before, there's far, far better titles out there. 6.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1593734755, "timestamp_updated": 1593734755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71909624": {"recommendationid": "71909624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044724910", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 277, "last_played": 1596772752}, "language": "english", "review": "Reminds me of childhood but with way better graphics!

Other problem is some times the contrast of color is too high in the background in some moments but you can still see the diference between MegaMan, the platforms, enemies and background which is great, altough some times you can still confuse with that.\n\nThen there is the soundtrack ... which is not bad enough, but the instrumentalization used here is not very complex and makes the most of the soundtrack is not remarkable ... except for the theme of FuseMan, which is an incredible theme that it is very dynamic for the type of level it is.\n\nThe gameplay is very good, the controls are nice and even better than before, the physics is similar but slightly changed, like the little boost you gained in the previous game when you fell from a long distance was removed, which can cause some problems to calculate the jumps. Having dedicated buttons for Rush is very intuitive, it caused a lot of trouble switching between them, and having a quick switch between weapons goes a long way to having a better reaction speed. Then there is the theme game design, somewhat disappointing is that the exploration parts and alternate routes are not shown here, making it less replayable, no collectibles, instead we have more items in the store that can be unlocked for your buy in different ways, it's not that bad, but it makes the challenge a little easy and less immersive with the player when they are easy to unlock, then farm. After that, there are the mechanics of the levels, most of them are very unique, and yes, they can be a bit tedious, but the game teaches you how this mechanic works without dying the first time you see it. ... and then, sometimes you are just BounceMan, as far as the position of the enemies are well done, although sometimes they are very redundant but without getting to the point of being tedious. And for the last, the difficulty, the game allows you to choose the difficulty, it helps new players to understand the basics of the game if you are a new player or a hardcore experience if you want a challenge, the game balances a In this way, The easiest is the best defense, but the currency of the game (in this case, the screws) has less possibilities of being thrown by the enemies, while the most difficult is the opposite.\n\n\nIt's one of the good games from the classic MegaMan, it gives you a fresh new experience that makes you feel like the other old MegaMan that existed in the past,

In regular difficulties for more experienced players however, the game is as challenging as the other Mega Man games.\n\n7- The ending takes a rather fun jab at the fact that Dr. Wily always begs for forgiveness every time he is defeated.\n\nSomething that I really HATED:\n1- Both Proto Man and Bass don't appear in this game for some reason, not even as DLC.\n\n2- There are still some cheap deaths occasionally, i.e. there are some places that trick you into falling to your doom.\n\n3- Underwhelming Wily Fortress.

Well the X series on SNES was a nightmare too. This game is so aggravating that they added currency and the ability to buy items to help you in each level. You can buy a stockpile of extra lives, health tanks, shoes that you can use 3 times a level to not die in one hit from spikes, a robot item that pulls you out of death pits and lets you keep going up to 3 times per level, a shield that lets you take half dmg in the current level until you either die or beat it, and a bunch of permanent upgrades you can install. So either you are a masochist and do the game without any of these things, or buy them and then it's way too easy.\n\nEither way, you still have a new double gear system where you can press LB to increase firepower or RB to slow down everything around you. Again, you can either do parts like on the fire stage where you are running to the right away from a wall of one-hit death flame following you, where you are only ever 2 seconds ahead of it at most, or you slow down time and it becomes a cake walk.\n\nThe bosses are no different. Even with the right blaster attachment to do max dmg to a certain boss, all of them have pretty much almost totally un-dodgeable attack patterns. Like Rockman for instance. He turns into a big rock golem robot, backs you against a wall, slaps his entire hand down in the only space you have to stand, so you just take a hit. I will be damned if I know how to dodge that and many other boss attacks so instead I just use my stored up items to keep replenishing my life bar and using the gear system, while switching around to find which gun attachment is the bosses weakness. Piece of cake then.\n\nFor a further slap in the fucking face, the Dr. Wily fight is insultingly easy. I could've done it without any extra powerups or health items, and I'm not kidding that if I fought him a second time I probably could beat him with my eyes closed.\n\n5/10 $7 wasted. They could've came up with something better than this game's misplaced gimmicks and horribly misplaced forced hits and deaths because of their a--holeish enemy and trap placement.", "timestamp_created": 1587592129, "timestamp_updated": 1587608384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.25619843602180481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67825948": {"recommendationid": "67825948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108562915", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1694209797}, "language": "english", "review": "A ton of pros and cons\n\nPros\nRoom for error\nA bit of puzzle platforming\nGood level design\nAmazing art\nAmazing visuals\nAmazing genre workings\n\nCons\nThe difficulty curve was a bit janky; I would rather have a game be a hit harder than easier.\nA couple of the levels felt short but that could've just been because after you get good in the beginning you'll breeze the other levels on by as if they're nothing.

But I just didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would. It isn't a bad game, just an uninspired one. The game feels dated and although I personally didn't play on the higher difficulties I did play through the whole game.\n\nLets note, this isn't a bad game. Its not a great game either. Its just okay. But Okay for a $30 game isn't worth it for me personally when I have so many other games I could buy that offer far greater enjoyment at a lower price.\n\nLets go through some of my personal gripes about the game. I didn't care for the English voice actor for Megaman, or any of the characters really. I ended up switching to Japanese because I didn't care for them, which helped a bit but the voice acting in either wasn't great. Some of the powerups were finicky and the Gear system I feel added nothing to the game in terms of gameplay. Yeah, it changed stuff up a little bit but it really didn't evolve the fight's in any meaningful way. I used it sparingly even though I could have used it more just because it didn't feel good to use.\n\nThe levels themselves were typical Megaman. Which is perfectly fine, but I found myself more frustrated as an enemy would hit stun me off a cliff. This is likely due to my own skill, but it didn't make me want to keep playing the game.\n\nThe parts system wasn't all that interesting either. Mostly seeming to be just a straight upgrade and not giving me real choices on what to choose. I didn't feel like it really added much to the experience.\n\nThe bonus challenges are fine, but this seems to be more for the Hardcore Megaman fans than someone like myself. Megaman 11 didn't capture me enough to want to play them. And the overall lack of other content to consume this game will likely sit in my steam library never to be touched again.\n\nI'm not saying this is a bad game. its not.

The level design of 11 provides some incredibly difficult challenges (hello Wily stage 1 and all the fall deaths*), *but* it also provides extra lives and life-saving items like no other MM game before it. Meaning you enter -- at least after the first handful -- every single stage with upwards of 9 lives, 9 energy tanks, and 9 weapons tanks. Auto's store returns, and earning bolts to spend is easier than ever before. It honestly felt like I was on easy mode or something with how much money they throw at you, and how many zeros are on your bolt bank despite everything in the shop being dirt cheap.\n\nWent on a bit of a tangent there, but gosh dang the store and plethora of cash felt weird.\n\nThe story's bonkers.

Luckily, Mega Man is more than ready for the job. Not only is this the first official classic Mega Man game since 2010, but it\u2019s also the first without Keiji Inafune at the helm. So, how does it fare? Let\u2019s dive right in. This is Mega Man 11.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1][i]The graphics and presentation are amazing.[/i]\n\nThe area that stuck to me the most for Mega Man 11 has to be the presentation of the game. The visual design of the stages, as well as the background, are very well done, while the enemies and robot masters are designed well that they don\u2019t stand out from the presentation.\n\nThe special weapons change that Mega Man gets was a nice change up, considering that the previous games in the series only gave him a colour swap. There aren\u2019t too many cutscenes in the game, but for the ones that are here, they\u2019re all presented very well, although I don\u2019t exactly understand why there\u2019s a chicken leg cooking in Dr. Light\u2019s laboratory.\n\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1][i]Where\u2019s Proto Man?[/i]\n\nOne thing I couldn\u2019t help but notice missing from the game was Proto Man. There was no mention of him in any of the cutscenes, no interactions possible in the game, and I\u2019ve searched hard for hidden areas that he might\u2019ve be hiding in, similar to how he was hidden in Mega Man 7.\n\nProto Man can be looked at as an often-forgotten character, but it\u2019s still a bummer that he\u2019s not anywhere to be found. This would be his first absence the main series since his debut in Mega Man 3.\n\n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1][i]Double Gear feature nice, but have some complaints.[/i]\n\nNew to Mega Man 11 is the Double Gear system, a device which can either power up your Mega Buster with the Power Gear, or slow down time to maneuver through difficult situations with the Speed Gear. Overall, it\u2019s a welcome feature, but I do have some \u201cnitpicking\u201d issues with them.\n\nThe first is that when you use the Speed Gear for the first time, it slows down everything, including Mega Man. This can be fixed with a part you can purchase later on. The second is when you use the Power Gear with the enemy special weapons. The combination makes the attacks perform a stronger variation of the basic attack. Something that the Mega Man X series first introduced. It just bothers me that the developers decided to go with this option, considering the X series is supposed to be after.\n\n\nMy final take for Mega Man 11 is that it\u2019s a great game. The negatives that I\u2019ve noted in this review are more personal nitpicks more than anything else. If you were interested in getting this game, you should definitely consider it.\n\n[h1]Developers (Headquarters)[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Capcom (Osaka, Japan)\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1584943247, "timestamp_updated": 1584943271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547087132930755615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65580870": {"recommendationid": "65580870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440096923", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1600564910}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no se que tiene, alguien me podra ayudar, que es realmente lento y no como veo en diferentes reviews", "timestamp_created": 1584910975, "timestamp_updated": 1584910975, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401606440544128418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65526075": {"recommendationid": "65526075", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998072912", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1584852991}, "language": "english", "review": "Wish there wall wall climbing", "timestamp_created": 1584853062, "timestamp_updated": 1584853062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65511410": {"recommendationid": "65511410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365551526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1056, "last_played": 1551321116}, "language": "english", "review": "Mega Man 11 is 2D platformer, much like pretty much all the old Mega Man games.

I can't think of one I don't like, and the Double Gear System is phenomenal!\n\nIt's also worth noting that you can, in fact, continue a series without just placing constant nostalgia bait throughout. Rather than going for the approach of \"Hey, it's this thing from that game! Please clap.\" every few stages (if not most stages), you can try something like, I dunno, INNOVATING. The Double Gear system is a fantastic innovation and lends itself seamlessly to the game feel and flow of Mega Man. You can slow actions down for more leniancy for mistakes or tough moments, you can power your Buster AND Special Weapons up for added effects and improved power. This new system is easy to grasp and get into using and comes with the added bonus of being a fresh new toy to play with without sacrificing anything that worked previously. It's just a solid, good addition to something that already worked. Fancy that.\n\nHonestly, 11 almost beats out 6 and 7 as my favorites of the Classic Mega Man games! The game not only proves itself to be strong enough to stand on its own, it's also just darn fun to replay over and over again! It captures what makes Mega Man so addictive and enjoyable the whole way through, and while the Wily Stages don't have as much meat on them as they used to, 11's stage design is so strong that it really doesn't matter if the game is shorter than the other titles. Without a doubt, one of my new favorite games in the franchise.

After playing this game, that's not going to happen because I really didn't like my time playing this game -_-. The biggest problem with this game is that it's either too difficult or too easy, with very little in-between. \n\nIn regards to the game being too easy, there's a shop where you can buy items. This is how you're going to get ALL your items, because this isn't a Metroidvania where you can explore for stuff. Through the shop, you can get 9 lives, 9 full hp refills, and 9 full weapon refills. 9 full hp refills is more than enough to beat any boss in the game, including the final boss. This seriously destroys any difficulty this game may have through combat. \n\nI thought I would mitigate this by not using the shop for lives or health refills and only use it to buy passive upgrades. Unfortunately, that's where the \"too difficult\" aspect comes in. This game is designed like old school games, which means that if you lose all your lives, you have to start the stage from the very beginning. Without buying lives from the shop, you only get 2 lives every time you die\u2026\u2026 and that's not a lot. By the time you get to the boss of each stage, you'll likely only have 0 or 1 life left. I didn't use the shop for the 1st 2 bosses that I fought, and both times I died with no lives and had to start from the beginning of the entire stage. This pissed me off so much.\n\nAnother thing that pissed me off was the platforming. There are so many god damn instant death platforming scenarios in this game. Like holy shit. I get that in the past, when you fell into a pit or touched spikes you instantly died, but does that mean every single god damn game in the future has to be like this? There are very few checkpoints in this game, so when you die you're losing a lot of progress.  What's worse is that in a lot of platforming sections, you're expected to succeed by trial and error. Unless you have crazy good reflexes, you're going to die by an enemy or a bullet that you didn't know was going to be there. To compare to Dark Souls, by mastering combat you master ALL combat (regular enemies at least). In Mega Man, mastering platforming means mastering platforming in ONE section, because the next section could have totally different bullshit.\n\nNow, you can mitigate the above by playing on a lower difficulty level. I finished the game on Normal, but I could've chosen Casual or Newcomer. Newcomer has infinite lives, pits don't result in deaths, and spikes don't 1 shot you. While that would fix what pissed me off in the game, it still wouldn't make the game incredibly fun (and would make the game TOO easy). That's because Mega Man seems to be about overcoming your weaknesses, not testing your strengths. \n\nTo elaborate, you can't do much as Mega Man. You can run around, shoot horizontally, charge your shot, slide, and that's it. You can't double-jump, dash, or shoot in different directions. Hell you can't even crouch. A lot of the enemies are designed to exploit these weaknesses. For example, some enemies are difficult because they're really small and your shot can't reach them while standing. Other enemies are difficult (including the final boss) because they're really high up in the air and you can't reach them by jumping. That's what your special powers are for. After defeating 1 of the 8 standard bosses, you get a special ability. These abilities range from shooting in a different direction to giving you a shield. Shooting in a different direction is very useful in this game because of how limited Mega Man's moveset is, and therefore they are crucial for getting through a lot of the platforming sections in this game.\n\nHowever, more recent 2D platforming games have you playing as characters who are far more fun to play as. In Hollow Knight, you can attack up and down as a given. In Ori and the Blind Forest, you can get a triple jump and can move pretty much wherever the hell you want. In Sundered, you get an omni-directional dash that you can use 8 times in a row. Compared to these games, I can't get excited over an ability that Mega Man gets that allows him to attack diagonally up -_-. That's what I mean by Mega Man is about overcoming your weaknesses (since Mega Man has a very limited moveset, so the enemies and level design is also fairly underwhelming), not testing your strengths (like other more recent 2D platformers who have a much more interesting and fun moveset and therefore the enemies and level design are much more fun to overcome).\n\nFundamentally, that's the real reason I don't like this game. Yes, the lives system is a pain in the ass and the instant death platforming sections are frustrating. But at its core, Mega Man is simply not a fun character to play as compared to more recent games.", "timestamp_created": 1577501201, "timestamp_updated": 1577501201, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469041287899017334", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60718947": {"recommendationid": "60718947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978838472", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1577498523}, "language": "english", "review": "Mega Man 11 is a decent shooting platformer.

Even the few classic Mega Man games I've played came with the privilege of savestates. Conversely, Mega Man 11 stays more committed to its legacy. Restarting a stage after losing all your lives is an acceptably retro inclusion. However, climbing through a lengthy level to challenge an unfamiliar boss capable of quickly demolishing your remaining attempts is rather cruel. This also makes practicing fights without knowing the cheese a terrifying obstacle. It seems that, unless you're a true MM veteran, you're likely going to find yourself repeating each level often just to get a few shots at the boss. Imagine, while playing a musical instrument, only being able to practice a difficult measure by playing from the start of the song up to that point.\n\nThankfully, the game's 'newcomer' difficulty is available to alleviate the threat of insta-kill obstacles and limited continues.

This one is in my opinion the best of them all. I'm glad this game decided to bring the franchise forward, rather than being held back by 8 bit visuals and old-school design like 9 and 10. That doesn't mean it's entirely modern in its design however, as game overs send you back to the beginning of a level rather than at mid-points like in 8. Seeing as the levels are very long in this game, I would really not have minded such a feature. Other than that and a weak soundtrack by MM standards, I can't name any flaws.\n\nThe highlights of the game are the robot masters, with battles like Torch Man really testing your reflexes and precision in a way that never feels unfair. Adding to that is a new limited time-slowdown mechanic that allows you to slow the battle down every time an enemy launches an attack, meaning that the next time they try it on you you absolutely know how to dodge it provided you are skilled enough.\n\nThere is so much care taken with the challenge of the game that really grabbed my attention. As just one example, Impact Man, like many masters before him, shakes the ground when he lands, causing you to be stunned in place. However, you will always still have a chance to evade his next attack, it's only harder to do so after being stunned.\n\nIt's also nice to finally see a Mega Man game with modern high definition graphics.

I would have liked to see something new but I guess they wanted the safe bet and kept things similar to the old games.\n- No rush armor\n- No Bass or protoman \n- You can only play as Rock\n- Sometimes the game just makes it way easier to use the double gear instead of figuring out the obstacle.

It adds the new Double Gear that can make the game feel way more fun at parts. One gear slows time like bullet time and the other makes your weapons power up temporarily. It is completely optional so if you'd rather just play straight up late NES era MM then here it is. \n\nControls are tight, graphics are super appealing, story isn't deep but kind of fun, music is just awesome and the level design is perfect. Only complaint I have (which is also something I praise it for) is the runtime. You'll beat it in about 2 hours which is the same as the rest of the og MMs but the Wily castle is pathetically anticlimactic: two stages, the rematches and then Wily and thats it. It ends so abruptly which is a shame when the rest of the game's pacing is so perfect. I praise them for not artificially extending the play time with a second castle like 3 through 6 but they should've had four stages, the final two ending with the rematches and the Wily fight respectively. If they had done that I think the play time would be absolutely perfect.\n\nAt the end of the day MM11 is fantastic. I'd put it in the top 5 of the series its that good. Not just for people who enjoy MM but anybody who enjoys a 2D action platformer. Presentation is great, gameplay is even better. Like I said the only real flaw is how anti-climactic the Wily Castle is but otherwise fantastic job.

Los robots maestros al igual que en MMI y MM9 son creados por el Dr Light.\n\nMegaMan recupera su barrida y mega buster como en MM8 y previos.\n\nSiguiendo la tendencia de MM9 y MM10 el juego no sigue la numeraci\u00f3n romana caracter\u00edstica de los juegos cl\u00e1sicos.\n\nNuevamente como en MM8 y previos existe un escenario a modo de introducci\u00f3n y previo a la elecci\u00f3n de las 8 fases principales.\n\nSe agrega el nuevo sistema doble mega que expande la modalidad de juego a niveles nunca antes vistos y le dan una frescura y genialidad nunca antes vista en la franquicia.\n\nEl modo tiempo donde ser\u00e1 como en Matrix que nos moveremos en c\u00e1mara lenta pero m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido que los enemigos y entorno, y el modo poder donde nuestros disparos y armas estar\u00e1n potenciados y tendr\u00e1n nuevas caracter\u00edsticas;

I don't think it will top any of the best Mega Man games, but it introduces a new generation to Mega Man and gives everyone a good chance at winning with all the power ups.\n\nSome people will probably say it gets too easy. I at first thought you could only get lives and stuff like that. With just lives this game is still very challenging in parts, and you really have to make sure you get the sections down well before you proceed to the boss fight. But after a while I went looking in the store and you can pretty much buy your way to easy mode. I'm not gonna knock the game for it, because there are achievements for doing it the hard way, but sometimes I feel they go a bit too overboard with the help.\n\nOutside of the that you have two sets of music tracks to occupy your time on the levels, and I very much enjoy switching between the normal more retro soundtrack and the piano tracks. The graphics and music together pull off a modern Mega Man vibe nearly perfectly.\n\nPersonally, I needed a lot of antideadzone on my DS4, but after that controls are very precise on analog or dpad.

One of Capcom's greatest faces still proves to be strong to this very day. This review is made with both regular fans and new people in mind.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[b]If you're someone who is already familiar with the Classic Mega Man series[/b], you will be right at home with Mega Man 11. The game is completely loyal to how you play the oldest titles and it feels perfectly like a classic Mega Man game with better graphics. You got all the classics: enemies that still behave just like they did 30 years ago, disappearing platforms, precise (often frustrating) jumps, usage of abilities and weapons for certain situations, harsh improvement after failure and all that. If you enjoyed the classic Mega Man games, will you enjoy this without a doubt.\n\n[b]The Gear System mechanic[/b]: This is Mega Man 11's theme and gimmick, the gear system is like a temporary power up that can either power up your attacks (and special attacks) or slow down time (actually speeds you up, but everything will move slowly). The effect lasts for a few seconds and then you need to wait for it to cool down to use again, you can cancel the effect whenever you want to make the cool down faster, as using it until the time limit will overheat you and make you unable to use it again for a while.\n\nEven though the game can be completed without ever using the gears, as there's even an achievement for that, you might end up thinking it's obligatory for certain parts of the game and of course that's intentional, the game was made with the gears to be used in mind. So here's the thing: when I first saw the first trailer of the game a long time ago, it felt like it would be too easy with the whole gears thing and you might be thinking that too but rest assured that if you're looking for a challenge, there's a lot of room for that, be it from not using special weapons to not using gears or both and ignoring extra health items, etc. the game gets a lot harder when you decide to make it harder, so don't shy away from the game thinking it is too easy because it certainly isn't if you want it to be hard. If you are one of the hardcore Mega Man players, this game got you covered and if you're just some casual player, you're also covered.\n\nNow [b]if you're someone who never played a Mega Man game[/b], this is a platformer where you will move around shooting enemies, dodging their attacks, jumping over obstacles and things like that. It takes time to learn the stages and bosses patterns, it can be frustrating but it's incredibly satisfying when you are able to run through a stage without dying once after struggling to get to the first checkpoint a few hours ago. Mega Man is one of the greatest examples of games ever done where you improve with time and effort, practice makes perfect and it feels damn great when you see yourself overcoming difficulties you had before, you truly can notice yourself improving.\n\nHowever, before you decide that this is the Dark Souls of platformers and not for you or whatever, I must tell you that Capcom made sure to adapt the game to all kinds of i\u0336n\u0336c\u0336o\u0336m\u0336p\u0336e\u0336t\u0336e\u0336n\u0336c\u0336e\u0336 players. Mega Man 11 features a number of things that make the game tremendously easier, first of all there's the old bolts mechanic where you collect bolts dropped from defeated enemies to improve yourself with extra items, parts and things like that. Those improvements can make the game an absolute joke, moving around with 9 extra lives, 9 E-tanks that restore all your life, 9 W-Tanks that fills up all your special weapons ammo entirely each, 3 usages of Eddie to drop you random recovery items, 3 usages of Beat to save you from dying from doing a bad jump or falling into a pit and several parts that make your life easier like making enemies drop more recovery items, less ice sliding, less damage, making the Gear system even more powerful, etc. Not to mention that aside from all this, there are still difficulties to choose, so even a r\u0336e\u0336t\u0336a\u0336r\u0336d\u0336 game \"journalist\" should be able to complete the game.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nIn terms of appearance, Mega Man 11 is what a lot of people have been waiting for a long time now, it's another installment of the classic Mega Man series but now visually adapted to a more modern standard. Many of the older fans still love the 8bit jump and shoot action but this new look is definitely welcome and nice. Things look great and still cartoonish enough like the series characteristically has always been like. They did it very well.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nIt's Mega Man, music has always been a most distinguished characteristic of the series, the soundtracks are great and they really fit the stages very well in terms of changing the beat or tune according to the average player's pace advancing through the stage and things they encounter. For a game like this, having good music is mandatory and in Mega Man 11 it is done very well.\n\n[h1]Game length and replayability[/h1]\nClearing the game on normal difficulty took me almost 8 hours, that's a very short of time for a \"main campaign\" of a game with this price tag. At first I was decided to not use any special weapons and upgrades, as that's how I usually play my Mega Man games, but things were too frustrating and I eventually started using everything the game offered me, which made progress extremely easy as farming bolts doesn't take long and I had over 4000 of them without intentionally gathering them while stuck on my second stage of choice without much progress, so I was able to buy all parts and tons of extra E-Tanks, etc. After clearing a few stages I decided to stop doing that because it was making the whole experience shallow and short. Still, I wouldn't say the clear time is a negative thing though, most players just clear their games without doing all optional stuff and consider it \"done\", so in my case I can just jump into the game whenever I feel like it and challenge myself with another run following more difficult \"rules\", try a harder difficulty or even go into the Challenge Mode the game has, which while not interesting to me, it's something to do for those looking for rankings and all that. With all that said, the game definitely has replayability.\n\n[h1]Final thoughts and nitpicks[/h1]\nMany people thought the Mega Man series was done for after Inafune left Capcom years ago and with the overall failure of Mighty no.9 to deliver expectations (I [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/uselessbunny/recommended/314710/] reviewed it [/url] too if you want to compare them), but this game proves Mega Man is still strong and the people behind it are perfectly capable of honoring the series and creating something great.\n\nIn my personal opinion, Mighty no.9 did a couple things better than Mega Man 11, such as the interaction between bosses and the protagonist and their presence in the story itself, while in Mega Man you're just destroying all your fellow robots that were turned evil (?) without looking back. I think both games are great but I'm really glad to see Mega Man 11 turned out to be so good after all.\n\nThere's only one problem, the usual problem: IT NEEDS MORE ROLL. CAPCOM PLS, IF YOU'RE STILL NOT GIVING ROLL HER OWN GAME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THEN AT LEAST MAKE HER MORE RELEVANT, GIVE HER MORE SPACE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. Also where the heck is Protoman and what happened to Bass?\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nA great new entry to the series, excellent adaptation to a more modern version of the game (something rare). Veteran players will enjoy it without a doubt and people who never touched a Mega Man game before will also find themselves an enjoyable experience. If you are a hardcore fan then buy it at full price without looking back, if you are not really that of a Mega Man fanatic or you're new to the series, wait for a sale.

It's almost what Mega Man X7 should've been rather than a 3D platformer.\n\nThe new gameplay mechanic, the Double Gear system, allows you to enhance your attacks via the Power Gear or speed up your movements via the Speed Gear. This doesn't take away from the tried and true gameplay mechanics and is a welcome addition. The Double Gear system is optional and you don't have to use them if you're a purist. But it is a useful system if you need to avoid enemy damage or power up weapons, especially the Tundra Storm and Acid Barrier weapons in particular.\n\nThe eight new Robot Masters are unique in both design and attacks. Each one also have a special gear attack when their health is low. For example, Block Man can use his Power Gear to transform into a giant stone robot and Bounce Man can use the Speed Gear to bounce around the room at high speeds. The weapons you obtain are probably some my favourites from the franchise.\n\nI won't say that it's a perfect game. The game feels a little short, especially during the final levels of the game and as of this review, there seems to be no plans for some much need DLC to expand the game upon. I sure miss playing as Bass and Proto Man sometimes. Also, the challenge modes, while fun, can get boring quickly aside from the time attack modes.\n\nBottom line, Mega Man 11 marks an excellent (and welcoming) return of a much-beloved franchise with some new additions while maintaning the classic Mega Man gameplay. It's not perfect and it has its flaws, but I'll keep on replaying Mega Man 11 1000 times over before I even give Mighty No. 2 another shot.\n\nOn a sidenote, I hope we get a Mega Man 12 and a Mega Man X9! Maybe Mega Man Legends 3...\n\nOverall recommendation: Highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1558323602, "timestamp_updated": 1558323893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50670970": {"recommendationid": "50670970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100354954", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 406, "last_played": 1587069147}, "language": "english", "review": "so far this has been the classic game updated that i've always wanted. he is back and they have done it right !!", "timestamp_created": 1558013964, "timestamp_updated": 1558013964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50637966": {"recommendationid": "50637966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016593247", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1556439331}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to play Mega Man quite a lot as a kid, especially the \"X\" series, and I was genuinely interested to play a new Mega Man in 2018, to see how it would play out in this current era, and it disappointed me.

Steam asked if I have changed my mind. I haven't. \n\nWell. Looks like Mega Man, smells like Mega Man so it's gotta be Megaman. The thing looks exactly how a new Mega Man game should look like in this day and age. \n\nHowever... It appears that Capcom have lost their thread on level design and are confusing fun with frustration. They took every trick that copped Mega Man 9 out of any replay value and used steroids on them. I don't really know what to make of levels that are so frustratingly difficult that you don't want to go back to them even in the easiest difficulty. \n\nThese kinds of things sometimes make me wonder who these games are actually targeted for. I mean, sure, the basic gameplay is there and it feels like Mega Man traditionally does... but in the recent games the level design has gone down to hell, really. \n\nI managed to run through the game in Beginner mode. Well... that's one way to beat through this heap, but what fun is it when everything dies around you so quickly that you'll miss half the game? Mega Man's near immortality helps you somewhat with the levels you probably never want to revisit again. \n\nSwitching to Casual mode still makes you miss half the game - only this time it's because the level design won't let you see it! After playing in the Beginner mode you'll have a grasp of the level design and you're already disgusted by the mere thought of returning to Acid Man, Torch Man or Bounce Man's levels. Now that Mega Man is a mere mortal you're going to need nine lives to clear the levels. \n\nActually, nine lives isn't going to cut it. \n\nAlso... Could someone PLEASE explain me what Capcom's obsession is with partially assignable keyboard controls? Why is the subscreen put in that random letter somewhere and we can't put it elsewhere?

The game looks absolutely gorgeous, each stage feels very unique, as are the minibosses and the boss fights. It has a very good sliding difficulty, so it fantastic for newcomers and pros alike. It still has the parts that feel incredibly unfair, like every Mega Man game we've come to love, like getting hit in the middle of a jump from something you could not have foreseen. \nIn all, the levels are incredibly well-thought out and MUCH longer than a typical Mega Man stage, which was an awesome change to the series and a welcome challenge. The stages are unique stylistically and thematically and fit not just the ability, but the personality of the robot boss. The enemies are unique to each stage and all pretty challenging. I thought they did a great job of introducing certain challenges unique to each stage that increased with difficulty as you get further into the stage. EX: with Block man, there are patterns of blocks you need to shoot/slide through before you get pushed into spikes. You're introduced to these blocks alone, then with enemies, then with patterns, harder patterns etc... Each stage has a similar challenge. I felt they were brilliantly executed.\nThe gear system is fun and unique and you can abuse it as much as you like. I chose mostly to use it to mess around, but it can certainly make some of the parts of the game where you're being chased, under duress or can't dodge a particular move a bit less stressful. Also, the power geared boss weapons can be fun. \nThe music is great. I particularly love the title, boss select music, blast and fuse man so far.\nWhen you change weapons, your helmet also changes in this installment, which again, is a small artistic change that kind of updates the game, makes it more enjoyable and just looks nice.\nThe game can be HARD. I had the patience to finish 1-5, which are also rather difficult and I wanted to break my controller at one point, then I calmed down and it put a huge smile on my face.\nSwitching specials weapons is incredible using the right-stick. You just slide it in a direction and it switches you to a special weapon. If you click the stick you go back to buster. Rush jet/coil are also mapped to buttons - makes the game more seemless!\n\nIf you like Mega Man, I can't recommend this game enough. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it at full price, because although Mega Man games are short, I always get enjoyment coming back and running through a few of them from time to time. Also, this is one of the best I've played and if you enjoy the series, you will appreciate the TLC that was put into this game.

MEGA MAN 11 is a glorious love letter to past adventures. To a fault, it doesn't do anything majorly revolutionary, but considering the variable output of its sequels, it's at least gratifying to know that this turned out very well and in my opinion, this is the best entry in the series so far.\n\n The gameplay remains as fun and glorious as it did for previous MM entries. This game, like most MM games, can be intensely frustrating at the beginning (I played on superhero difficulty first) ; the jumps and timing are extremely tight sometimes and at the beginning, you have to get used to it, find out the right boss order and buy some power ups to make it easier, but that\u2019s what makes it so perfect. Double Gear System is the newest twist to the classic gameplay. Power gear which enhances your buster, and Speed Gear that effectively slows things down around you. Learning to use both effectively is key to making things work in your favor, it's not an overpowered mechanic. I found level design has been polished so they demonstrate the difficulty the franchise is known for without the Gears, yet can't be cheaply run through using said Gears. The content is quite short, like all the MM games, but the various achievements give you a reason to replay the game and there\u2019s even a challenge mode for the most skilled players out there.\n\n It\u2019s exactly like the old games with a few new twists and better graphics ; the graphic style is rendered in a clean, gorgeous hand-drawn style that feels very much at home with what you'd expect from classic MM. There are cutscenes in the game, thankfully skippable, and yes, there's voice acting ; the story is nice, despite being very simple like it has always been with the previous entries. The music has yet to catch me as truly memorable ; it's passable stuff, although not quite as good as in previous MM entries.\n\n All told, though, Capcom has done a fine job of producing a game that lives up to its predecessor, and it plays exceedingly smooth on PC (I use a PS4 controller), with no noticeable hiccups.", "timestamp_created": 1546855722, "timestamp_updated": 1546855722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525000035762786865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48149407": {"recommendationid": "48149407", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973112986", "num_games_owned": 3600, "num_reviews": 174, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1544277989}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Aunque mi saga favorita es Mega Man X he de decir que este juego es incre\u00edble.

The double gear thing feels a bit gimmicky, but it's neat.\n\n* Having only played a couple hours in a couple sessions, my impression of some of the levels isn't great. The ice level has some obnoxious platforming bits where it's windy that are really pissing me off, but that's just a matter of getting it. There are two spots that I have more of an issue with; the fire level and the water level. Both do things reminicent of other Megaman games, but they're taken up a notch, which seems unnecessary to me. Underwater spiky bits and \"move before the moving hazard kills you\" have both been done in MM2, and felt more balanced and fair in that implementation than they do in MM11. Each successive game does not need to be harder than the last.\n\nOther than that, I've been enjoying it.\n\nNot sure what to make of the price. On the one hand, it's a new game, and it's polished to the standard I expect (with the noted exceptions above, as far in as I've been), but on the other hand, there have been new Megaman games released this decade that were far cheaper and required no less development (MM 9 & 10) that I enjoyed on the Virtual Console for a fraction the cost. I know these games cost far more back in the day, but that was State-of-the-Art back then; they were the Triple-A games of their era. Maybe I'm just spoiled by emulation, but times have changed.

Now, if Capcom can finally take Mega Man Volnutt off of the damn moon by making a Mega Man Legends 3 we will be in business. Also, if anyone would by any chance read this message I have a few questions, where in the world is Proto Man and Bass?! Why have they just been pushed out of this game? Are they going to (hopefully) be in Mega Man 11 as DLC? If not, why the hell not? It would be pretty damn stupid not to do that. It would boost Mega Man back on top where he should of been long ago. Capcom should probably come up with more stages to this game and have the Mega Man killers and / or the Stardroids return to battle Mega Man, Proto Man and Bass. Do you know how much money would come in for DLC like that?! Just an idea to make the game more fun than what it already is. Having the stages around the length of a Mega Man 9 or Mega Man 10 stage is enough for each of the Stardroids though or just the same length from the old Gameboy game.

(The only one I (initially) missed was Mega Man 8, since I didn't have a Playstation.)\nI regularly go back and play through the series, as they've always been some of my favorites.\n\nConsidering that I grew up on the NES series, and was never really a fan of Mega Man 7 on the SNES, I was extremely  pleased when 9 and 10 were in retro NES style.  So, I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little disappointed when I heard 11 was going to be \"updated\".  However, I understand.  They'd done their thing with 9 and 10, and it was time to move on to new grounds, and refresh Mega Man with elements that can't be done in an NES style setting.\n\nOverall, I think they did pretty well, and I recommend the game to anyone who is a fan of the series.  I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next, and I'd eagerly welcome a Mega Man 12 done in the same style (and 13, 14, etc.)\n\nPros:\nThe game feels like Mega Man.  Right from the beginning, it felt familiar.\n\nThe levels each have their own unique look and feel with some clever designs.\n\nIt's challenging and fun without being too angering.  A couple spots had me pretty irritated, but I got passed them.\n\nDespite some \"cutesy\" graphics, the game didn't feel childish and cartoon-y like Mega Man 7 did.\n\nMega Man's different styling for each weapon is fun and clever.\n\nCons:\nThe music is pretty forgettable.  It's good, but lacks anything that'll leave you humming it later.\n\nSome areas require some very precise maneuvering and controls, but the precision to Mega Man's controls and his moves just aren't sharp enough.  I'd often be bonking my head, or wondering why he didn't jump when I know I pressed the button.\n\nI wish there was more to do in the levels, like secrets to look for, or upgrades to find.  There needs to be something more to do for players that aren't into \"challenges\".  \n\nLastly, item purchasing is ANNOYING.  You can only buy one item at a time, and having to listen to Roll ask me I'm sure I want to buy it, then congratulating me for buying it, and then wishing me luck for *every* *single* *item* purchase makes me apologize to anyone else in the room.  Especially when I'm filling up on 9 lives and 9 energy tanks and any other item's I'd used up.  Hearing \"Okay Mega, what'll it be!?  .... Are you sure?   Okay!

The fact we get to hear what the robot masters sound like is a treat. The music....oh brother the poor sound track.\n\nI know some will disagree and you are welcome to do so.

Its the same synth and whatever is used for every stage, and the Wily stages all share the same theme. They're easily forgettable except maybe Bounce Man's stage.\n\nThe challenges are what they are.

Using fewer elements in smarter ways leads to all stages feeling unique and never getting boring. Every level is designed in such a way that it every challenge feels fair, so your losses never feel cheap and your victories always feel earned.\n- Lower difficulty level than previous entries makes the game a lot more accessible, with harder difficulties optional for masochists like me.\n- Art direction and polish is off the charts. From small animations and character details to background stories in stages to giving each stage an actual sense of being a place in a world rather than a series of rooms, you can really tell the designers cared about making a great game.\n- Enemy and boss info gallery is equal parts charming and hilarious.\n- Bosses have a mid-fight \"super mode\" that makes (some of) the battles a lot more interesting.\n- Charged shots against enemy shields now knock the shield away for a short period, which really mitigates some of the most frustratingly unfun enemy types in the series.\n- Hitting the opposite direction while sliding will cancel your slide, which is ALMOST like being able to duck!\n- Dedicated button(s) for summoning Rush.\n\nNeutrals\n- Double Gear system is a solid boost when you need a hand but I rarely found any reason to use it outside of the occasional burst of Speed Gear for some tricky platforming (or getting stunned by an enemy during the wildfire in Torch Man's stage) or Power Gear on Tundra Man's power when I didn't feel like dealing with enemies on a screen. Definite utility for people who want to enjoy them game but have trouble with more difficult areas, but under-utilized and felt a bit tacked on.\n- Upgrades system is like the Double Gear system: helps mitigate difficulty, but doesn't really make the game more interesting. Would have like more manual upgrades that change the way the game is played rather than just making Rock stronger.\n- Most of the music is fun but lacks the earworm catchiness Mega Man is known for. Tundra Man and Block Man have the best music imo, while the Wily fortress boss fight themes are dreadful.\n\nCons\n- The ending feels like it's building up to something entirely different. Final boss is disappointingly easy and the narrative finale is unsatisfying.\n- Lack of hidden areas and secrets mean no exploration, no stumbling on anything cool. That's definitely more of a Mega Man X design philosophy than Classic series, but still felt disappointed by it.\n- No alternate modes except for the Challenge mode.\n- No alternate characters. Proto Man and Bass don't even show up in the game, let alone appear as platable characters.\n- After Mega Man Powered Up I want every Mega Man game to have an alternate mode where Roll beats everyone up with a broom.\n\nConclusion\nA great game, very worth playing whether you're new to the series or a long-time fan.

I spent more time navigating myself through this level more than any other level in the game.. \n\nDown to the meat of the review now.\nI want to let you know I did nominate this game for that award due to how much fun I had overall with machines and Robots. This game is like the best Robotic game I have played in 2018. It's a B grade title, because of the level of Bounce Man being unsually different and mostly bouncing your way around the level. Shooting down these pusher blocks and defeating enemies as you make your way toward Bounce man. I also, didn't like the song for that character. All the others, I did enjoy. IT DOES have an AMAZING OST if you're into Techno, Dub-Steps.. that sort of thing. Bounce Man is more pop feeling like you were at an amusement park, but more annoying than pleasant. Mostly, this is my own opinion on one song that I didn't like. But, the other songs like Acid Man, Torch Man, Fuse Man, etc! Are like amazing songs in their tracks! \n\nI actually pre-ordered this game once I found out it was releasing on Steam. I like the Double Gear System. It's designed as a helpful tool especially with the boss battles. The slow time feature helps with knowing when to dodge enemies, but you can't overuse it or else you have to wait a period of time before you could use it again. [But, it still helps tremendously with boss battles knowing when to evade/dodge them.] The Overcharge feature is helpful when you're really into a Hack/slash mode wanting to unleash a lot of power on your enemies. However, again.. you have to be extremely careful with this even at this setting. Because, the system does turn off when it's overused and you have to wait a period of time before you could use it again. It's handy with the power-ups and with boss battles when you want to unleash wrath on them.\n\nAside from that... I loved the Artwork. \ncharacters, storyline... I just didn't understand the confrontation too much between Wily and Light at the end of the tunnel, but it's just me. Who knows if we get more content? That would be awesome! I found Wily's Plan B is super funny when he's trying to get Mega/Rock to \"Spare him\" = Spoiler warning.\n\nI'm still working on getting all achievements on 11, but in the mean time enjoy the review.\nIf you played the game and didn't like it. It's completely understandable! \nI know people who bought this and told me, they didn't like it over trying to adapt to Double Gear and the fact the levels are too hard for them. Personally, I love the challenge. Block Man was like super careful for me, as LEVEL 1 choice. I had to really pay attention to Block structure and make sure I landed Mega/Rock accordingly to succeed! The other levels aside from Bounce Man were very ENJOYABLE. \n\nThis game reminds me of Rock/Paper scissors with ELEMENTS among ROBOTS. Still, a super done game! \nI just would have changed Bounce Man's song and overall level to be more enjoyable. \n\nStill my favorite game of 2018 for more fun with a machine due to I loved the storyline. Although, the ending was rather different than the past Original MegaMan/Rock Man games.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1542887037, "timestamp_updated": 1542887037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46244315": {"recommendationid": "46244315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072298009", "num_games_owned": 4351, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 3828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3828, "last_played": 1544591942}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot better than i expected it to be.\n\nThere's really only two complaints i have with this game:\n\nThe music isn't as spectacular as everyone hoped.  Mega Man games have routinely had top notch exceptional music soundtracks, every song being an instant classic.  In this one however the music is very forgettable and almost unnoticeable in comparison.  That being said there is many music conversion packs people have created and will create to rectify this problem (The most recent one i tried was the 8-bit version)..\n\nThe only other complaint i have is minor, in that it's hard to tell where Mega Man's hit box is so jumping in tight areas like Torch Man stage gets a little frustrating, but you can get use to that.\n\nAlso, there's really only 2 full Wily stages (not including Wily and the re-fights), but all the robot master levels are longer than normal so it kind of makes up for it.  Still a bit of a disappointment when you get there, but it's not a huge deal.  One more Wily level probably would have done the trick.\n\nOverall, very nicely done.  Might be controversial, but I might even consider it to be in the top 5 if not top 3 best classic Mega Man games (classic meaning 1-11 not including the X or Zero series, which i have actually not played yet).\n\n------------------------------\nControl Scheme I Used:\nGamepad defaults with D-Pad for movement.

I don't HATE the music. It's... good? I have trouble saying that, but I at least know I don't think the music is BAD.\n\nIt's just... y'know?\n\nMegaMan has such a STELLAR reputation with music. If I had to make a list of all of the best video-game music I ever heard in my LIFE, much of the top half of the rather comprehensive list would be dedicated to MegaMan songs throughout the ages. SnakeMan, ChargeMan, FreezeMan, Armored Armadillo, Blast Hornet, Mattrex, oh god... how iconic is the X vs Zero theme from X5!?\n\nThere aren't enough words on the planet to tell you how I basically WORSHIP MegaMan for all the good music it has. I recall the stage music from every classic bot from 1-11 by heart, and most of the MegaMan-X series (only a few from X8 escape me, such as Gigavolt Manowar and Avalanche Yeti).\n\nBut 11? It kinda... it kinda dropped the ball.\n\nAgain, it's not like the music is bad. It's just... it has such big shoes to fill. Such phenomenally big shoes. And I've heard people make the unbelievably stupid defense of \"oh you just hate it because it's not NES chiptunes\". Like, [i]how fucking stupid do you gotta be to forget MegaMan 7 and 8 were things that existed[/i]. And why only Classic? I'm also comparing to X and there's NOTHING unfair about that. MegaMan X music isn't directly superior to Classic MegaMan music. What the hell kinda fan says dumb shit like that? [i]The kinda fan I'd [b]excommunicate[/b], is what[/i].\n\nBut, like I said, it's not bad. It didn't hit the mark I was expecting, but it works for what we've got. I'll give the music a barely passing 6.5 out of 10.\n\nAs for the difficulty, I'll just say this.\n\nYou can...\n[list]\n[*]A) Play the game the way it's [i]intended[/i], and make full and unrestricted use of your Gear System, Special Weapons, and a variety of consumables and parts lovingly prepared for you by your family who's always got your back, or...\n[*]B) Do [b]none[/b] of that, go pure Buster-Only and make life [i]un-necessarily[/i] hard on yourself for [i]no goddamn reason[/i] and then complain the game is too hard.[/list]\n\nIf you're looking for a \"real\" challenge, SuperHero mode is... alright, I guess. It mainly just removes item pickups from the stages, and makes it so the only things that drop from enemies are screws. So if you want to recover health or weapon energy you need to use consumables like E/W-Tanks or Eddie.\n\nSo if you really want a challenge just pick Option-B. It's not entirely un-fun! I give difficulty a solid 10/10. Got easier modes if you want, got ways to make it harder if you want.\n\n\nSo... what else to say? Game's good. Looks and feels great. Boss designs are fantastic and I want a TundraMan action figure sometime in the future. Go get it!\n\nI give MegaMan-11 a solid MegaMan-10 out of MegaMan-X.", "timestamp_created": 1542876841, "timestamp_updated": 1542878255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46201970": {"recommendationid": "46201970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046131696", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 575, "last_played": 1539354141}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 would rage again", "timestamp_created": 1542873262, "timestamp_updated": 1542873262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46194502": {"recommendationid": "46194502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027903644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1546326701}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh yeah!

Robot masters are EXTREMELY memorable, as well as their stages, each one has an awesome track and aesthetic that will stick in your head for weeks. Voice acting, is not like mm8, the voices, both English and Japanese, are not bad. they're really well done. but if you prefer to have your robot busting adventure without voice acting,  [spoiler] or just make Roll shut up everytime you buy an item... [/spoiler] there is an option for that. However, the game is not perfect, there are some things that i would like changed, starting off with fuse man, hile my favorite robot master from the game, i found his fight to be too bright and flashy, squinting my eyes every so often, i would like there to be an option to tone down effects like these, because maybe people can't still see if their brightness is turned down, moving on, i wanted there to be more of the classic sounds preent, this is only a little nitpick of mine but, i really wanted to hear that \"badoop\" sound effect when megaman landed or the classic \"pew\" sound effect from the buster, just made to fit a modern soundboard, this is only my opinion however.\nOverall, if you're new to the series, or a megaman veteran like myself, this is an absolute must-have. the game is very challenging, as are all the megaman games, but the varied difficulty settings shouldn't deter anyone, as they ease the player into the mechanics and teach them in a way.

There is totally no objectivity here. ;)\n\nThe stages are pretty good, though definitely long. This makes up for the amount of stages there are. These stages have great level design (Though, I've run into only a few problems with the enemies being in odd places and cheap placements) and have interesting gimmicks. The only stage that has an oddly executed gimmick would either be Bounce Man or Torch Man. Torch Man's gimmick is kind of cheap if you don't know it's coming and the enemy placements that are found in these firewall sections are placed specifically to be annoying if you don't know they're there. This gimmick is fine if you already have played the stage or seen the firewall in a video. The Bounce Man gimmick is just annoying to work with, especially when your motion-sicknessing around the whole place towards the end. Otherwise, pretty good.\n\nThe enemies are a nice variety, though you happen upon a select few through several of the robot master stages. They all have pretty nice telegraphs and the enemies that are self-explanatory are, well, just that. The only possibly bad enemy would be the one that shoots in eight directions. Sometimes, it's hard to see with the effects. \n\nSpeaking of effects, the game looks great. Despite Mega Man in 2.5D being an iffy thing to have, this game executes it well in a way that doesn't consistently hinder the player's experience. The only problem is the huge explosions, which can hide enemy shots and can distract players easily. \n\nThe bosses are my favorite part. They have easy to memorize patterns and the ones who focus on distance are usually challenging and fun, like Torch Man. Tundra Man, though doesn't telegraph, has easy to dodge attacks and always does the same thing. Having a Mega Man boss without telegraphs is a risky decision, but the boss works well with less animations to slow the fight down. The Wily Bosses are also well executed, though the first boss didn't really disappoint me, but more of just excited me to see what they would do with the gears. \n\nOh, and the gears. The gear system is pretty good for beginners who aren't well practiced with Mega Man, but it also opens up choices for people who speedrun these games due to the Time Gear slowing down time in levels and the Power Gear having the ability to destroy literally every mid-boss and boss in the game pretty quickly. \n\nThis game is also a bunch of fun. There's also replayability in the new game modes, challenges, and different routes that you could take in the game, though, I would probably lower the price a bit because there isn't enough content that would make one play this game for more than several hours unless they were a Mega Man fan. \n\n10/11 I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1542841019, "timestamp_updated": 1659998443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46065025": {"recommendationid": "46065025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058949780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1636785209}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like old times. 2D Platform is really fun to play.", "timestamp_created": 1542839952, "timestamp_updated": 1542839952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46060064": {"recommendationid": "46060064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117610133", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3021, "last_played": 1592507300}, "language": "english", "review": "Top game!!!", "timestamp_created": 1542839088, "timestamp_updated": 1542839088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46047086": {"recommendationid": "46047086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069348472", "num_games_owned": 580, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 396, "last_played": 1630440158}, "language": "english", "review": "It plays and feels like a Mega Man, nuff said, I love it~\n[Totally didnt do this simple just for the badge thing]", "timestamp_created": 1542837047, "timestamp_updated": 1542837047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515418469905853271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46041896": {"recommendationid": "46041896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029174152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 596, "last_played": 1626052325}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic return to form.

Being able to slow down time is definitely helpful in various areas, and increasing the power of boss weapons you've obtained can help out alot against minibosses and robot masters.\n\nWhile the game has things like water physics, wind physics, ice physics, or water with wind physics, and ice with wind physics, it doesn't do any of these things in too cheap or annoying of a way. In water you don't really move slower, it just lets you jump a lot faster and higher (which can be tricky if there are instant death spikes around).\n\nIf slipping on ice is too bothersome, you can also buy boots to negate the ice physics. Though usually jumping constantly is a good enough way to ignore how slippery the ice is, because the ice's friction and your jumping does not take into account your existing velocity, meaning you won't have to worry about things like having difficult to control jumping or landing.\n\nOf course, many of the challenges in each stage aren't too difficult to learn, though jumping into them they may seem challenging, there is usually a way to make things easier, like slowing down time to navigate the tight platforming while you run away from the deadly fire walls in Torch Man's stage, or using Block Man's weapon to destroy the chemical droplet enemies before they turn the floor into dangerous acid, or using acid man's weapon to complete ignore a huge falling platform section full of homing missile and other projectile enemies.\n\nMegaman 11 does what I really loved about Megaman 8 - it's a game where, the more you learn how to beat its challenges, the easier they become, to the point where your mastery of the game becomes a very tangible achievement as you shrug off things that you could previously barely E-tank your way through.\n\nAs a closing tip: Making use of the double gear system for time slowing is much easier with a controller than with keyboard controls.", "timestamp_created": 1541939166, "timestamp_updated": 1541939166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481927722692489624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45758898": {"recommendationid": "45758898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056352614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 89, "last_played": 1699243037}, "language": "english", "review": "From what I have played of this so far, it is genuine to its calling.\n\nI was around to play Megaman 1 when I was a kid, and this installment of Megaman truly continues the tradition of the game.\n\nIt is challenging beyond all get out, and it has the same gameplay except it is decades better as the game development industry has improved.\n\nIf you are a fan of the original Megaman, I would not miss out on this one.\n\nIt looks like Capcom actually did something right for a change rigtht off of the bat.\n\nStreet Fighter 5 took 2 years after release to get right, this game won't need such attention. \n\nIt is perfect as is.

aniversario, faltaron en la banda sonora temas cl\u00e1sicos uno esperar\u00eda escuchar aunque sea uno de los temas insignia durante los cr\u00e9ditos, tambi\u00e9n el tema de yelow devil (eso s\u00ed que fue una decepci\u00f3n total no escucharlo), en fin a la banda sonora le falt\u00f3 bastante nostalgia, a dem\u00e1s de eso se extra\u00f1\u00f3 la presencia de algunos personajes y la falta de importaci\u00f3n de otros (tanto para el juego como para la trama), una historia sacada de abajo de la galera a la que le falta, ya no estamos en la nes que limitaba la imaginaci\u00f3n las escenas de la historia tendrian que haberse hecho animadas como las de megaman 8, m\u00e1s historia y animaciones en los niveles, y hablando de los niveles les falta mucho, no son rejugables les falta interacci\u00f3n con las habilidades que se van consiguiendo, poder conseguir cosas extra o las habilidades para rush en partes que se puedan acceder solo rejugando, encontrarte un BOSS cl\u00e1sico

aprovechando al m\u00e1ximo el potencial de los equipos de ahora y aportando ese toque nuevo que si tiene.\nIgualmente es un juego bueno y recomendable (caro para lo que da) y esperemos que sirva como

Even a low-end gaming build from the past 3 years will have no trouble running things.\n\nAs far as the game itself, it's exactly what you'd expect from a Megaman game - balls hard and full of instadeaths, precision-platforming, and varied bosses that have specific weaknesses to other bosses' powers. Aside from the gear system (one boosts your offense and the other slows down time) the big difference this time around is that Capcom added a lower difficulty for casuals. Try it out if you're intimidated by the normal difficulty:\n\nThe beginner's difficulty lowers the damage you get and removes instadeaths (spikes/acids are no longer instant death, and you have a little bird that will pick you up when you fall into the bottomless pits).

Ive played every single megaman game for the GBA, ive played half of the megaman  series, and i even played the star force, Zero, and ZX series in its entirety. Yes i love this franchise as it has been a source of entertainment for me for all 22 years of my life, i even went back from time to time to play the older games during Capcoms 8 year break from the series. That being said... Oh boy Mega Man 11 is freaking hard lol. When they introduced the double gear system with the speed and power gears I thought to myself \"oh cool theyre giving new mega man players a we to beat levels easier.\" What i DID NOT expect was that there are litterally levels and bosses where you NEED these features or you will most likely get destroyed. And, of course, as a veteran mega man player Im stubborn and litterally didnt want to use these features because i figured \"there has to be a way to beat this without using speed gear!\" so i died... a lot because i tried to force my way through some levels that are almost impossible to get through without the speed gear.\nThe music is deffinately reminiscent of the old megaman games but theres clearly a new tak on it and im fine with that. I realse like fuse mans theme. Graphics are good and so are the animations, which is really important for a game where you can slow down time, animations arent clunky.

It makes a lot of clever improvements without watering down the traditional core gameplay. Despite a few minor shortcomings, the game can be heartfully recommended to veterans as well as to players looking for a challenging shoot n' run. While the game may not be long, it does have a lot of replay value, so the price tag is mostly justified in my opinion.\n\n[u]Story:[/u]\nThere is a little bit more story than in the older Mega Man games, but this is not a game played for the story. You still fight Wily and that's basically it.\n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nLike in the classic Mega Man games you basically run through a linear level, shoot everything in sight, fight a boss at the end and, if you beat him, get his weapon. It feels like it should and I never felt like it wasn't my fault if I died. While the game has a four difficulty settings, beginners should expect that it will take a while until they beat their first level, even on the \"easy\" difficulties. The trade-off is that it feels amazing to completely annihilate a level, once you have figured out how to beat it.\n\nWhat's new is the gear system, which is allows the player to switch into one of two modes for a short time. The speed gear is basically slow motion, while the power gear allows you to charge you standard Mega-Buster even further and - way more important - allows you to instantly fire powered versions of the boss weapons you have collected. The later strikes me as a clear improvement tho the old charge-system introduced in the X-Series.\n\nWhat is great is that the system implemented surprisingly thoughtful. This means that every level can be beaten without using the gear system at all. However, this will make the game more challenging than even some of the classic games. However, even purist should grow to like the system once they learn that it is not just something to help new players, but that it also allows for a lot of new tricks and strategies, i.e. when speedrunning the game.\n\nAlso, it is a great idea to use the right control stick to select the weapons and to have to designated buttons for callings Rush Coil (a trampoline) or Rush Jet (allows you to fly). This does not make Mega Man as fast as the X or Zero-Games, but it does make the Gameplay way more fluid to be able to call Rush instantly without opening the menu.\n\n[u]Graphics:[/u]\nUnlike the older games, MM11 is fully in 3D, albeit still a 2D-Plattformer. While the artstyle may require some getting used to at first, the developers have wisely shoosen to put visibility first. This means that while the models may look a little bit \"flat\" like from a flash game at first, I never felt like i didn't have a clear view on the situation. Where the game look truly great is when it comes to lighting and explosions, which look simply fantastic and way more visceral than any Mega Man game before. \n\nAside from that, the levels are diverse and you will spot a few very nice touches, like the adorable Metals around the campfire in Torch Man's stage.\n\nAlso it runs at a rock-solid 60 fps.\n\n[u]Sound:[/u]\nWhile the sounds for shooting, explosions, etc. definitely do sound like you are battling huge machines, the voice acting and the music may be the weak spots of the game. Mega Mans voice simply sounds a little too \"mature\" for my taste and may have been more fitting for the \"older\" X than the Mega Man. However, the Japanese voice-over is a little bit better, but also not great.\n\nThe music is definitely not bad, but it tends to get lost in the action. Also, while some tunes are catchy, you will not find anything as iconic as the Metal Man or Wily-Stage tunes from Mega Man 2. But frankly, this is an unreasonable expectation though.\n\n[u]Content:[/u]\nWhile the main story is a little bit on the short side in terms of levels, this gets mostly equalized by the fact, that the levels are a lot longer than in the Mega Man games before. However, I could not help but to be slightly disappointed that the Wily Fortress only consists of basically two levels this time. \n\nWhere the game shines is in the extra modes, which not only allow for competitive speedrunning and boss rushes, but also provide many variations and different challenges on the levels and even a few extra-hard levels. I personally very much liked a mode where you have to shoot every blue balloon in a level while avoiding the red balloons. This may sound boring at first, but the developers did a stellar job positioning the balloons in a way that forces you to truly understand what each weapon in your disposal does. \n\n[u]Overall:[/u]\nI love Mega Man 11. While it may not reinvent the genre, it does bring many new ideas to the table that are not just gimmicks, but actually improve the gameplay and may be used in all Mega Man games to come. Aside from that, the gameplay is fun and rock-solid as ever.\n\nI personally hope that the team will be working on Mega Man X 9 next.", "timestamp_created": 1540516537, "timestamp_updated": 1540516624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45441137": {"recommendationid": "45441137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138097009", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 469, "last_played": 1604598340}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked it", "timestamp_created": 1540515726, "timestamp_updated": 1540515726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45428678": {"recommendationid": "45428678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027062390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1543715040}, "language": "english", "review": "Capcom manages to retain the classic gameplay, challenge and feel of old school 8-bit megaman, while giving it a shiny new coat of paint that enhances rather than detracts from the experience.\n\nPros:\n-- Classic Megaman, unspoiled by the modern look.\n-- Great visuals, especially the explosions and lighting effects on certain stages.\n-- Great soundtrack, as any good megaman game should have.\n-- Some of the best robot master stage design of the entire series.\n-- Incredibly challenging, but with multiple difficulties and an item shop to alleviate the frustration for less hardcore players.\n-- Double gear system is a great tool, but never becomes a necessary and overused gimmick or is required to beat any boss or section.\n-- Great replayability(as all good megaman games have)\n\nCons:\n-- Robot masters arent particularly challenging, even without using their weaknesses or the double gear system.\n-- Price point is a bit steep for a 3-4 hour(tops) game(even if it has great replayability)\n-- Robot master weaknesses arent very interesting(none of them change the fight), and their weapons are generally lackluster.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you love megaman, this is an easy buy.

The gameplay is great, the controls are great, the stages are great, the stages have different elements and things going on in them gameplay wise to make them stand out from each other, the boss fights are great, the weapon upgrades you get from bosses are cool, upgrade system similar to Mega Man 8's where you pick up bolts as you're playing and buy stuff when you're at the stage select, etc. Unlike the previous Mega Man games, this game runs on widescreen instead of a normal aspect ratio, and unlike lets say first person shooters, different aspect ratios have a significant impact on sidescrollers, and this game makes good use of widescreen, which is cool. I think I can speak for everyone when I say that this is how we were hoping Mighty No. 9 would turn out.\n\nMega Man 11 introduces the double gear mechanic, you can use it to either do a bullet-time like slowdown to avoid attacks and stuff easier, or to charge up your buster for an even more powerful shot beyond the regular buster charge. When you have double gear active, it generates heat, and theres a cooldown while you're not using it. If it heats up beyond the threshold then it becomes disabled and is unusable until it finishes cooling down (I think the cooldown actually might be slower after it gets overheated than the regular cooldown).\n\nThe graphics are good, they're simple but look nice and the game is very visually readable. The different weapons don't just change Mega Man's colors, they also give him different helmets and busters, I thought that was a neat touch. The music and voice acting are decent. The game also has extra stuff outside of the main game, such as all of these challenge missions and so on which all have online leaderboards, you can also upload your own and watch other peoples' replays of them doing these challenge missions. I imagine speedrunners will be happy as one of the challenge modes is a time attack mode where you can see how fast you can complete a stage and it shows your exact time.\n\nOne gripe I do have about this game is the superhero difficulty level, its unbalanced, poorly thought out and can use adjustments. In superhero, there are no longer items scattered throughout the stages, so the risky and tricky areas that have an extra life, energy tank or whatever lose purpose as the items are no longer present on superhero. Health, weapon energy and so on no longer drop from enemies, which is fine, but bolts still do and their chance to drop is increased by a good amount, so you're able to buy way more consumables and get upgrades way earlier than usual. So superhero takes a good step towards the hard direction, but a few steps back towards the easy direction. The amount of health enemies have in superhero is increased too, in another type of game having the difficulty level increase enemy health would be a good idea, but for this its a bad idea. The only thing superhero does right is increase how much damage enemies do. So I recommend playing the game on normal.", "timestamp_created": 1539572862, "timestamp_updated": 1556598618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442028999328613281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45275849": {"recommendationid": "45275849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033214733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 627, "last_played": 1550883013}, "language": "english", "review": "MEGA MAN IS BACK!!!\n\nI've been waiting so long for CAPCOM to finally do this!

It shows that a lot of work went into this to get the best of both world. \n\nThey learnt from the past not to repeat the same mistakes: in MM8 they added more frames to all anims just because they could, the result felt sluggish. In MM7 the low FOV made everything worse than it should be, but here with a widescreen ratio we end up with good looking characters and enemies of a reasonable size without hindering gameplay.\nAnimations and gameplay were really thought together, there are some nice touches like being able to break the guard of most shielded enemies with a charge shot and witness the funny anims that go with it. \nThe only time this feels wrong is when Robot Masters use their Gear power-ups, as it took me a long time to figure out when you could hit them or not when they did.\n\nThere are only 10 full stages + 2 small ones, but each of those 10 stages is at least 50% longer than in previous classic MM games, so there is more base content than in MM7 or 8 for instance. This being said, I would rather have more but shorter stages instead, game flow and feeling of progression would be better that way.\n\nI am a little disappointed however by the design philosophy of those stages. While MM9 and 10 dared to challenge players, 11 doesn't so much, and on top of this, keeps giving the player a ton of easy way outs that they can use instead of having them learn. The Double Gear, although not the only one, is the prime element of that philosophy, press a button and you have an easy way out, and an un-fun one at that: fun comes from fast paced tight action, while the speed gear slows down everything... Also, the more you use the easy way outs, the more the game helps you by unlocking upgrades for them, that's how far the philosophy goes. \nYou don't have to use any of those easy way out if you don't want to though, except for one exception.\n\nThis being said, the stages, bosses, and challenges that come with them are still better than in 5, 6, 8, perhaps even 7.\n\nWeapons could have been more fun, half of them have their attack delayed one way or another, which sucks the fun out of them. Press button, mandatory wait, attack unleashes... \nThe Pile Driver though, a dash attack that you can even pull in mid air and as long as you energy for it, is amazing.\n\nWith this base content comes a bunch of challenges, some of which are fun and unique content like Doctor Light's Trial. \nThe hard difficulty was very disappointing compared to 9 and 10's hard modes... These changed enemy placement to play around players' expectations, but here there is no changes in stages except stats (MM recieves double the damage, basic enemies take 2 shots to kill instead of 1) and all pick-ups disappeared...  The AI of bosses is enhanced like in 10's hard mode, but unlike in 10, only less than half of them in a substancial way that really asks the player to fight them differently.\n\nDespite what I said about the quality of animations, and although I've seen worse, I'm not fond of the general graphical style and \"2.5D\" in general, and would rather have had high-res 2D graphics, like Wario Land Shake Dimension or Duck Tales Remastered. \nThis approach takes more time and ressources though, and those games are shorter probably because of it, one can't have everything.\n\nMusics are good, but the sounds they use lack power. It all sounds too smooth, mixed in together, and what should sound impactful doesn't.\nCutscenes are sluggish, they drag on and on for far longer than they should. All skippable.\nVoice acting is a little annoying, a bit less so in Jap. Volume can be turned down.\n\nDespite all the negative points I said, this is still a very good classic MM game, not the best MM game but far from the worst. \nTight gameplay, good stages and bosses, fair amount of content, and that's what matters most.\n\nP.S:\n- Where's Protoman ?!

Mega Man 6 and later Mega Man X, honestly), this is the perfect throwback with a combination of tight gameplay and frustrating timing-based puzzles.\n\nWhat I like best is that it's about as frustratingly difficult as Mega Man 1 (played on Normal anyway).  Still the required perfect jumping and sliding and furious shooting.  One major difference from the ones I remember is that in addition to Rush upgrades and boss weapons, you also can collect gears for buying upgrades to your core abilities, things like auto-charging your weapon or sliding less on ice.  These are a great offset because the more casual gamers like me still get some kind of payoff for the hours of dying over and over again, because at least you can stock up on stuff and probably make it through the level.\n\nFor all you hardcore gamers, you can just do it \"hardcore\" and not get any upgrades.  I, for one, enjoy the more casual approach since I don't have hours and hours to dedicate to this game.  It's a good balance between the two, I think.\n\n$30 was a bit high in my opinion; should have been $20, but obviously I bought it, so I guess they had my number.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1539490841, "timestamp_updated": 1539490841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45258507": {"recommendationid": "45258507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304148993", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 2394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1635335146}, "language": "english", "review": "Take this review with a grain of salt.

First Edit me is  scrublord who needs to git gud.\n\nPros:\n+ Consistent performance\n+ Good PC options\n+ Lots of cute, kid-friendly charm\n+ Double Gear system is incredibly helpful to both newbies and veterans\n+ Double Gear and Master weapons combination gives Mega Man so much utility and creative gameplay\n+ Solid level design\n+ A+ Boss fights due to the new mechanics\n+ Adds a small layer of nuance and depth to established series\n\nNeutral:\n_ 60 fps lock\n_ Denuvo (has never affected my computers personally, but it is worth mentioning to those who have had bad experiences with it)\nEdit: Denuvo is gone!\n- Lacks a New Game+ to take upgrades on higher difficulties, but has lots of replay value with stage order/challenges\n\nCons:\n- Lives systems, respawning enemies from offscreen, and instant death obstacles can feel outdated/cheap to newer gamers\n- Ocassion input lag (Fuck you Tundra Man Stage)\n- While great, levels last a bit too long, which can kill the pacing with the previously mentioned old-school features\n Edit:Checkpoints on Normal and up are way too sparse and spread out (personal bias kicking in real hard here)\n2nd Edit: Disregard that first edit, just git gud (by buying lots of weapon tanks, all the parts, and even some Beat the Birds)\n- Cannot rebind inputs to D-Pad while using the left analog stick\n- Post Game content is rather bare", "timestamp_created": 1539484848, "timestamp_updated": 1555533490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61338043212890625", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45257776": {"recommendationid": "45257776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063717981", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 840, "last_played": 1538956545}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing new on this game if you compare it to a SNES version, besides the graphic.

The game could be better without Denuvo due to the performance loss is creates, and bounceman as a stage is more infuriating than anything ive seen in the entirety of the megaman franchise.

I feel a few pixels would make it feel a little more natural - esp compared to other megamans. \n2. Controls - (Disclaimer! Im using a wired PS4 controller - could be my issue) waaaaay too many times I hit the jump button and nothign would happen. This occurs after another action immediately prior - such as running right, turn left + jump = nothing.  Falling in the air, use my shield ability, after I hit the platform, immediately jump = nothing. Its a platformer, this is a big problem and like #1, it hurts the feel of movement. \n3. Music - Music is boring and immemorable. I mean COME ON, its megaman, these tunes are embarrassing. \n4. Slide (worst one)- Name one person, ONE!

If you are a fan - stop reading this and get the game. For others, if you are up for a challenge and some precision platforming I have a couple of things to say about the game.\n\nThe story of two professors who were once friends but now pursue their own goals with superb voice acting. The artstyle is beautiful and the game looks really polished and clean. The soundtrack is amazing and enjoyed it so much that had to download it. SFXs though are more on a generic side.\n\nYou'll face 8 Robot Masters before confronting the final boss and each of them will have their own thematic wolrd filled with unique mechanics, enemies, hazards and an unlockable special weapons. Each bosses have their own basic and unique attacks, but all comes to learning their patterns and mastering it. In fact the whole game relies on memorisation of enemy locations and if you remember all of it, you can easily finish stages without taking a single hit.\n\nLevel design is great because obstacles and hazards change depending on the chosen world. You can use you helpful robo-dog Rush in order to jump higher or surf towards a rare consumable. Your double gear system, which was introduced in this game to aid you in your journey (slowing down everything around or boosting your power) will give you an extra edge in a tight situation. Furthermore, if you are low on health, you can go all-in and use both gears simultaneously. While this will heat up Mega Man very fast, it can and will save your life if used properly (good balance of risk and reward).\n\nBattling in general is great, while you can skip most of the enemies, I tried to fight every single enemy I could. Every robot master as well as enemies inhabiting their world are vulnerable towards specific element. So unique wepons, which you get from robot masters, do not feel useless at all. In fact you are likely to use them more than just exploiting weaknesses of the bosses because they can aid you to traverse levels faster or clear the screen of smaller enemies entirely.\n\nIn-game shop offers consumables and upgrade parts. While you can forget about your extra consumables, upgrading parts feel satisfying and on point, giving you exactly what you wish you had.\n\nWhat I disliked the most are the challenges and Bounce Man world. \nMost of the challegnes are simple, with even simpler rewards (gold, silver and bronze medals). Others will test your patience especially Dr. Light's Trial which leaves very little room for an error. If you are an achievement hunter, this will be the hardest one (although some may argue that beating the game in under an hour is tougher). \nHitboxes of balloons in Bounce Man's world are infuriating sometimes. You will hit it before you should and bounce like crazy before your brain will catch up what happened there, so you've been warned.\n\nLastly, beating the game on hardest difficulty, getting golden rank on all challenges and unlocking all of the achievements rewards you with nothing. Really, no special upgrade, no bonus ending, nothing for completing the game.\n\nI would recommend this game to newcomers, casuals, obviously fans but for completionists - just pass it. You will put yourself through a lot and get nothing in return, apart from satisfaction that you have finally beaten everything.\n[/quote]\n[quote]\n[b][ Achievement Types ][/b]\n\u2611 Difficulty Based\n\u2611 Missable\n\u2611 Skill-Based\n\u2611 Story Related\n\u2611 Timed/Speedrun\n[/quote]\n\nOrder and weaknesses: \n[spoiler]Tundra Man -> Torch Man -> Blast Man -> Block Man -> Acid Man -> Impact Man -> Bounce Man -> Fuse Man[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1539297088, "timestamp_updated": 1539297111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580948293209075928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45222344": {"recommendationid": "45222344", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993751746", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1627837326}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Yo he empezado en modo superh\u00e9roe y siento como si estuviera jugando de nuevo al Megama 1 en mi NES, as\u00ed da gusto.", "timestamp_created": 1539286439, "timestamp_updated": 1539286439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45220514": {"recommendationid": "45220514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124482181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1551657558}, "language": "english", "review": "Hard as SH!T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1539277300, "timestamp_updated": 1539277300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524155616760253906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45218974": {"recommendationid": "45218974", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963367931", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1543248139}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate this game! \n\nOh, it's really, really fun!

I am happy MegaMan's back, but what's the point of playing if the controls hamper the player's ability to do so?\n\n[b]Unlike in all previous games of Classic [i]MegaMan[/i], Rush Coil and Rush Jet CANNOT be mapped to the same button as other weapons and must be assigned separate buttons (including from one another) or not at all.[/b]\nOther than control sticks and the d-pad, most controllers have the following buttons:\nStart,\nSelect,\nL1 and R1 (and sometimes L2 and R2),\nAnd the four \"main\" buttons of square (X), cross (A), circle (B), and triangle (Y).\n\nIn [i]MegaMan 11[/i], The Power Gear and Speed Gear as well as the Previous Weapon and Subsequent Weapon toggles are reasonably mapped to L1 and R1 and L2 and R2 by default, but there are also six other non-movement functions: shoot/charge, jump, slide, shoot rapid-fire, Rush Coil, and Rush Jet.  But (other than Start and Select) there are only four other buttons these functions can be assigned to.  To its credit, the game does allow sliding by pushing the 'jump' button while pressing 'down' on the d-pad at the same time, but it is much more comfortable to assign 'slide' to one of the four main buttons, like how the 'dash' function is assigned in the [i]MegaMan X[/i] series.\n\n[b]In [i]MegaMan 11[/i] the player can call Rush even when his special-energy gauge does not appear on screen![/b]  Rush Coil and Rush Jet now use the same special energy, and the special-energy bar that allows players to see how much of Rush's special energy is left is only visible when MegaMan is in \"normal style\" (i.e. when he does not have a special weapon equipped).  This keeps the screen from becoming cluttered, which is a good thing, but the player ISN'T able to see how much special energy is left for Rush abilities if a special weapon is equipped; yet the player can still call Rush when MegaMan is equipped with a special weapon, automatically unequipping the special weapon, which if Rush's special energy turns out to be low may in the heat of battle prove to be a disastrous mistake!\n\n[b]The controls feel like a big step back from [i]MegaMan 9[/i] and [i]MegaMan 10[/i] in which all special weapons and in-game functions were accessible without pausing the game.[/b]  The Rush abilities are realistically still special weapons just like in previous classic MegaMan games, and they still have a special-energy gauge and take special energy, so pressing the same button to use special weapons as to use one of the abilities like in earlier games would have made more sense and seems more intuitive.\n\nPlus, why bother to map Rush Coil to a button by default if Rush Jet does not have a button by default?  If players such as speed-runners like the option of being able to call Rush at all times, that's fine, but I prefer not being able to de-equip my special weapons needlessly or by mistake.  Again, I do like how the player can use Rush abilities with \"normal\" MegaMan now, but [b] without the freedom to freely assign which button I want to press to use my special weapons the new control scheme remains finicky.[/b]  In any case, [b]making both Rush abilities separate from special weapons has crowded out other functions such as 'rapid-fire' and 'slide', which was not the case in past MegaMan titles[/b]; this has hampered me so much that I have resorted to only calling Rush by means of the in-game menu, which defeats the point of making the other abilities accessible and slows game-play down unnecessarily.\n\nEven though MegaMan also has the ability to metamorphose into different 'styles' just like in the MegaMan Battle Network games, which is very cool, this new ability doesn't affect the game's mechanics in the slightest.  The styles make me feel motivated to complete a stage with the same special weapon equipped, but [b]using 'rapid-fire' automatically unequips special weapons just like calling Rush does, plus MegaMan reverts back to normal anyway if his equipped weapon runs out of ammo, so it becomes impossible to complete a stage with a single style if the special weapon runs out of its special energy.[/b]  Ideally, it would be preferable to allow the player to keep the equipped special weapon even if there is no ammo left for it, allowing the player to survive with buster shots until MegaMan picks up more special energy for the equipped weapon (after all, any special energy MegaMan finds normally goes towards his currently equipped special weapon if he has one equipped).  Doing so would also show how MegaMan's metamorphoses have a positive impact upon game-play beyond their visual appeal by allowing MegaMan to more easily maintain his special weapons.\n\nAs for the controls, [b]a better set-up would be similar to the controls of [i]MegaMan X4[/i], which gave the 'special weapon' function its own button and allowed the X-buster to be used with a special weapon still equipped alongside the two other functions of jumping and dashing[/b]: four functions for four buttons.  As I mentioned, [i]MegaMan 11[/i]'s has many separate functions but only four buttons to use for them.  Even so, a new set-up for [i]MegaMan 11[/i] could look something like this:\n\n[u]MegaMan (no special weapon equipped):[/u]\n1 (square/X) > Shoot and charge buster\n2 (cross/A) > Jump\n3 (circle/B) > Rush Jet or Slide\n4 (triangle/Y) > Rush Coil or Shoot rapid-fire buster\n\n[u]MegaMan (special weapon equipped):[/u]\n1 (square/X) > Shoot and charge buster or Shoot special weapon\n2 (cross/A) > Jump or Shoot special weapon\n3 (circle/B) > Rush Jet (auto-unequips the current special weapon) or Slide or Shoot special weapon\n4 (triangle/Y) > Rush Coil (auto-unequips the current special weapon) or Shoot rapid-fire buster or Shoot special weapon\n\nThe 'Shoot special weapon' function, when equipped, would take precedence over whichever other function is assigned to the same button, and this set-up has the additional benefit of allowing MegaMan to fire buster shots with a special weapon still equipped similar to the controls in [i]MegaMan X4[/i]; if balancing becomes an issue as a result, perhaps the charge shot could be reduced one level while a special weapon is equipped (similar to how only a small \"partial\" charge shot was ever possible in [i]MegaMan 4[/i]).  If players prefer mapping 'Rush Coil' and 'Rush Jet' to buttons, perhaps 'rapid-fire' could also be achieved with 'jump' + 'up' on the d-pad, just like 'slide' can be done with 'jump' + 'down' on the d-pad, or alternatively as I would prefer 'Rush Coil' could be 'jump' + 'up' and 'Rush Jet' could be 'jump' + 'down', and 'rapid fire' and 'slide' could instead be assigned to buttons.\n\n[b]I sincerely hope that in an update Capcom gives players greater freedom to change the control scheme in the options' menu, such as the ability to assign the ability to shoot special weapons to the same button as either Rush Coil or Rush Jet[/b]:  They did after all share the same button in past games of the series.  [b]It would also be very welcome if MegaMan could fire buster shots while having special weapons equipped.[/b]  For now I am too frustrated with the new control scheme to be able to progress any farther in the game.  (Ironically, as I said, I haven't had any trouble with the Speed Gear and Power Gear controls.)  I've never had issues with the controls of a game I haven't been able to fix by means of the options' menu before, and I was greatly looking forward to this game so the wonkiness of the new controls was a huge disappointment to me.  I hope my comment is able to draw attention to these issues; nevertheless, I am happy other people have found enjoyment in the game.\n\n[u]P.S.[/u] In [i]MegaMan 11[/i], MegaMan's never called by his real, civilian name: Rock.

It introduces a new \"gear\" system that will greatly assist any new players, while at the same time never pushing itself on the classic fans such as myself. Mega Man 11 presents a fair challenge for old and new players alike, not to hard, not to easy. All of the bosses are fun and challenging, and some battles can get very intense. The gameplay is amazing and the graphics are wonderfully designed and well layered. Just a beautiful game. The addition of new skins for mega as opposed to simple color changes is quite refreshing. The music is good, although not as memorable as other titles. The story is also well done while not overloading you on dialogue. This game is well worth the low $29.99 cost. ( I myself am used to paying $49.99 a title and most of those were well worth it for replay value alone. ) I give this one a 9 out of 10 only because the music is less memorable. Also not a big fan of Bounce Man or his level, but that is just personal preferance and in no way effects my rating or review. On the whole an amazing title that I highly recommend.

There aren't that many spikes, platforming is manageable, overall it's not too hard, but still challenging.\n\nThere's a shop in game in which you can buy more lives, energy tanks, and tools to help you beat each level more easily. To be honest, they tend to make the game too easy, as you can just buy as many lives and enery tanks as you can, and spam them on the bosses. But that's up to you.\n\nThe Double Gear system is nice, but just like the shop, you don't need it to complete the game. I've been using the Speed Gear a lot because I suck at reacting quickly, but a player with more skills wouldn't need it.\n\nThe OST isn't too bad, but forgettable. You can't beat 8bit tunes for a classic Megaman game. The problem might come from the instruments, I don't know.\n\nI haven't tried the challenges yet, not my cup of tea, but if you like to compete with other players, you'll love it. Boss rush and time attack modes are always welcome.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I bought it, though I feel that 30\u20ac is a bit too much. But I'm happy enough that they keep making old-school games like this one.

Yes. If you are a Mega man fan this is a good Mega Man. And if you are not and want to try and play one of these for the first time, the Slow Motion ability will help you get up to speed, appropriately enough.\n\nNow I'm on the first camp, being a MM fan since the 90's so I can attest that even though the basics all work, the game feels a little lacking. There are no secrets to be found on the stages, and the game is only like 12 stages long. They are all challenging at first, but soon you'll be flying through them. Some.\nThere is also the fact that the Super Shot that is meant to be the other half of the Double Gear mechanic is basically useless. Or at least it was for me, I only used it in like two bosses and the rest of the game I use the Slow Motion which... is kind of OP.\nAnd once you get a handful of Bolts... the game is basically over. You got instant access to 1ups E and W tanks and other useful stuff, so you can load yourself up with them and blaze through most of the game. But that is something you opt into so it's easy to ignore, and great help if you are struggling I guess.\nOh, and most of the boss weapons are great fun. I am usually switching between 6 out of the 8 at any given time.\n\nNow my computer is not the best, but I understand the game in general can have performances issues. I saw stuttering at the most busiest boss fights like Block Man or Blast Man. I understand other had bigger issues though, so you should check the negative reviews to find more details.\n\nTo summarize, it's Mega Man. And it's good, if a little short.

That's sort of a good thing, because it gave the new feature use, but it doesn't exactly make MM11 a better game, just a different game.\n\nHere's the list of things missing that were prevalent in the previous MM games:\n[list]\n[*]No intro stage. (just cutscenes)\n[*]No mid-game stage (after 4 bosses). (just cutscenes)\n[*]No Protoman appearance.\n[*]No Bass and/or Treble appearance.\n[*]No utility aspect to weapons.*\n[*]Run animation still looks stupid.\n[/list]\n\n* Regarding the \"No utility aspect to weapons\" part, think of Crash Bomb's ability to destroy certain walls in MM2.  Nothing like that exists with the exception of the Pile Driver obtained from Impact Man, which can allow you to get under certain platforms.\n\nIf none of that bothers you, then you'll have a fun MM time.  There's still the 8 robot masters you'll have to fight again in Wily's stages, and you can buy upgrades between stages.

While Megaman 9 and 10 were great games in their own right, their desire to stay so similar to Megaman 2 ended up hurting them in the long run, removing long standing mechanics implemented in the franchise such as the charge shot and the slide, and only having them available as DLC in the form of protoman, who had these mechanics as well as a shield to block projectiles, but at the cost of taking more damage. Now, in Megaman 11, the slide and charge shot have finally returned for Megaman, and it's very nice to have them back. Not only that, but the game comes with a brand new mechanic - the double gear system. This system allows you to use the Speed Gear to slow down the world, and you as well (unless you buy an upgrade in the shop), and the Power Gear, which soups up your systems and gives you the ability to fire multiple charge shots and power up special weapons, almost as if borrowing from the X series. These perks come at the cost of a limited timer, and should you exhaust it, you will be left on a cooldown unable to use the function until you run the timer out or collect a gear powerup that reduces the cooldown. Not only that but there is also a final desperation mode, where if you are at low enough health you can activate both gears at once, but make sure you take out your opponent or you will be left even weaker than before after the timer runs out, being able only to have one projectile on screen at a time along with being unable to use any gear powers.\n\nThe robot masters this time around are all super creative, and I really liked all the special weapons they gave me, especially when superchanged with the Power Gear. They also make short work of the robot masters as well, once you find their weakness, and it's pretty exhilarating to figure out the weakness order. Another neat thing I noticed was that the weapon a robot master was weak to also had a lot of great utility in their stage, so it's now a tradeoff - do you want an easier time in the stage, or an easier time fighting the boss? The bosses can also use the double gear system as well and make the fight a bit more intense, such as moving at blinding speeds or super charging their attacks. Overall, all 8 robot masters are vert challenging and I had a great time tackling them and their stages.\n\nWe're going to get a bit into SPOILER territory now, but I feel I need to talk about the Wily stages, as in my honest opinion I feel they kind of dropped the ball here. MM9 and 10 may have spoiled me, but I've been so used to the castle stages having a unique music track for every stage. Not in 11 - you only get one single music track for all 4 stages. While it's a great theme, it does get a bit old after the first few stages. Not only that, but the bosses are a bit underwhelming too. The first boss is just the Yellow Devil again (it's technically the MK III but it looks identical to the original apart from the gear pattern in its eye, which is admittedly a nice touch). I'm really getting sick of these Devil-type bosses now. The boss of the second stage, while definitely more creative, kept reminding me of that bubble boss that was also from Megaman 1. The third stage is just a short drop to the Robot Master refights - no boss at the end, you just take a warp and the stage ends. After that, the final stage is just a climactic lift ride to the final boss, where small robots shoot at you every so often which ends with a Portal-esque end at a spike wall which I am embarrassed to say killed me a few more times than I'd like to admit. Eventually, I realized you just jump down off the lift. Then comes the Wily Machine, which of course leads into a Wily Capsule which this time takes heavy inspiration from Megaman 7's. While an overall challenging fight, it doesn't make up for having essentially only 2 full Wily stages.\n\nOverall, despite the lackluster final stages, I still really appreciate the direction the series has taken.

TLDR version is \"It's awesome and accessible. Likeable and will be satisfying for both newcomers and pros alike\" \n\nOk, Here we go. \n\nI have to say that I was not at all a Megaman fan/player. I mean. I grew up during the boom of X series. I have heard and I have seen my older cousins got teir asses kicked playing classic series. But I never actually enjoyed plaing it myself. Why? Because it was frantically tough! That's why! And when the time passed. Video games evolved. As things got flashier, edgier and more complex, the blue hero started to fade out from my memory and it never really piqued any of my imterests at all despite several attempts to emulate it and play it on my PC. Same goes for X series.\n\nBut this changes everything! This is the first time I really enjoyed playing Megaman. I don't feel like a dumbass dying to bosses or failing to jump onto platforms. This game is amazingly accesscible for an adult me with a full-time job who gets to play games only on weekends. \n\nHere's why;\n\n-Nice, clean and beautiful 2.5D style graphics! Superbly megaman!\n\nI mean, I like the old 8 bit looks but i think we  can agree that it is time for an upgrade. And I have to say that this conversion from 2D to 3D or 2.5D is amazing. It really captures the essence of Megaman in a way that it's not too bland despite generous amount of flat colors used. The character designs are so great that the basic coloration and lighting bacome complimentary to the overall visual. As I said, It's very clean looking which I think a lot of fans and newcomers can appreciate.\n\n-The difficulty options in abundant! You can now choose your poison!\n\nI am not sure about the \"new\" new ones like 7-9 but from my memories when I was younger, 1-6 got nothing. You started the game. You kumped right into the actions. The somewhat difficulty choices might be the boss order that you go through because some are vulnerable to the weapons you get from the other bosses and if ou figure out where to start and where to go next, things might be slightly forgiving for you. I said slightly because the enemies along the way until boss battle will plough you hard no matter what. \n\nAs for this iteration, you get to choose before you start the game which difficulties you want. You want easy? Go get it! You're a masochist? Who am I to judge? You can choose whatever you want which will affect the damage you take during the stages and also in boss fights.\n\n-In game Shops! You get an item! You get item! Everyone gets an item! \n\nDuring the game, you collect bolts(?) which act as in-game currency for you to buy stuffs. And the stuffs are so damn good! Bored of sliding uncontrollably on ice platform? Here's a pair of spike boots! Running out of weapons power constantly? Here's weapon power tanks! Died from spikes much? Here's a save for dummies from spikes! and so much more that you can buy to make it easier or more accessible for you. I understand that the hardcore fans will be like \"Heck! This is an insult! We don't need this at all! It's a disgrace\". But hey! it's all optional. While it's there and the newbies like myself can buy some to alter our first time experiencing the game to suit our needs, the hardcore playing can totally avoid them all and play with none of theses upgrades or items with NO PENALTIES AT ALL FROM THE GAME DESIGN PERSPECTIVE. \n\n-New element in gameplay with double gears system!   \n\nOk. We all know by now that the game comes with double gears system. It's nice. I wouldn't say that it's something that will blow your mind but it can and will spice things up for you. To sum it up, Megaman now has 2 gear modes to activate at any given time. The power gear and the speed gear perform like the name suggests, one gives you attack boost and the other the speed. The stage was designed with this system in mind and you will be wise to utilise it. However, from my playthough, if your good enough, you don't really need them. The fact that it's there but quite optional makes me appreciate it a little bit more, to be honest. I mean, It means they're not forcing this down your throats which will definitely be frustrating for the old fans. \n\nThe game is still the same. It still follows the same formula of 8 master robots gone rogue. Megaman is the only one to stop them and save the world from doctor Wily. You jump in. You fight 8 bosses. You go through Wily fortresses, fight extra bosses, go through boss rush and kick Wily's behind. Then the game ends. Credits roll. \n\nAnd that's that! It is new. It is exciting. It is highly accessible. I won't talk about the challenge mode or extra modes because those are not for me and it is very likely that I will not play them at all. But for those of you who looks for extra value out this game, I heard that you won't be disappointed.\n\nFor 30 USD or your regional equivalent, if you like what you read and you like what you see in the trailer, buy it.

Most of it comes from the Screw Catcher item which makes screws drop from nearly every enemy, and the fact that Doctor Light seemed to always be dropping the price of E-Tanks and lives, meaning that I always had a full stock.

And ONE GLARING OMISSION that I won't spoil.\n\n\nAlso, the game is TOO easy (for vets) if you allow it to be. Collecting parts allows you to cash in with Auto, Roll and Dr. Right in-between levels for upgrades and tanks (much like MM9 and 10). Want a challenge? Don't buy anything from the shops. Planning on doing that for my master run.\n\nOverall? Glad it's not a $60 game. Short like a retro MM should be. Though they have challenges in optional modes - there is not much more to dive into.

On classic MegaMan games I could jump and use my regular shot to hit anything every time.  The timing seems just a hair off with the old arm cannon especially during the jump animation.  I've been able to deal with it, but it doesn't feel 100% on the mark.\n\nOne other small thing that doesn't feel right is the animation and stun that goes on after being hit.  You get knocked back an amount that I would consider to be the width of a 'block' in this game.  This would be similar to a single block graphic in the original that was repeated to create the level.  I feel that after this slight immediate knockback I am more frozen in place and for slightly longer than usual.  This creates an unfamiliar feeling compared to the classics and it causes some deaths that the old series in a similar situation would not create especially when converyor belts are involved.\n\nAlso, as others have stated the music I have encountered so far isn't of the caliber of MegaMan 1-3 (my golden video game years), but it isn't bad by any means.\n\nThe game is indeed hard and my instinct as a classic MegaMan gamer is to not use the gear system to 'nerf' my way through it, but I am definitely being tested for not doing so.  Just on BlockMan's stage alone the miniboss which I just got to a second time is tough to predict soon enough to get out of the way without using the Speed Gear especially the second time around when the game throws a conveyor belt into the fight which seems like a cheap shot in my opinion.\n\nWould I recommend it this early on?

If you like Mega Man, or Shovel Knight, or A.R.E.S. or any other good platformer then this is a game you need to play. If you are still sceptical, grab it on sale, but its worth full price i.m.o..\n\n[h1]Slightly more detailed[/h1]\nI love the original Mega Man series. I love the X series, the Zero series, the Legends series and so on. I've been a fan since we got 2 on the NES back in 1990. You may think me a fan boy, but the truth is I'm especially critical of any additions to my fav platforming series. Mega Man 11's announcement therefore filled me with both hope and dread, would it hearken back to what made the series great? Would it simply be another cashgrab after the appallingly poor X collections? The answer is a bit more grey than a simple yes or no. But personally, I think its worth it on weighing pros and cons. Lets get into the details.\n\n[b]The Good[/b]\n11 is a new game under a new team, with an interesting new gimmick in the form of the dual gear system. The robot masters are interesting and more challenging than average since they too use gear systems. \n\nMany of the stages are beautifully designed, despite my reservations about the 3D form of the game. I especially love the designs in Torchman, Blockman, Blastman and Bounceman's stages. Most stages offer a good, interesting challenge as well, with unique mechanics. \n\nThe weapon designs are good too, for the most part. That's one of the innovations in the game as well, each weapon alters the look of Mega Man more than in previous games, though Blastman's weapon turns you into Axl from MMX7-8-CM.\n\n[b]The Meh[/b]\nThe music. Its not bad, but... unlike previous entries, its damn immemorable. No standout themes, bar maybe Fuse Man's, all fairly muted too and some  a bit... reminiscent of earlier themes. Some stages are also underwhelming in design. There's challenges too, but... not particularly impressive ones.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nFrankly, there's some less than optimal level design here and there. Acidman, Impactman, Tundraman and the Wily stages have segments that troll players. Such as instant-death spikes in a forced movement area, a gruelling trek before a mid-boss and a slippery segment with blizzard storm to name a few. Yes, you can try, try and try anew and there are items to help you, but these segments and others feel less natural than hazards or challenging areas in previous games. \n\nThe voice-acting is to put it mildly quite bad on the English side, ranging from reading aloud while bored to being on crack like Bounceman. Seriously, I'd rather turn them off tbh.\n\nThen there's the Wily stages. All two actual stages and two more walk to the boss ones. Frankly, they are underwhelming in extremis. The first one is the most challenging, but not in a good way. You need to use your gear gimmick a lot, with upgrades just to pass some trolling segments. And then the MK3 Yellow Devil is the boss. IT ISN'T FUN HERE! You need to use your speed gear to avoid his segment-rush and miniversion-rush (he has speed gear too) and then you just HAVE 1-2 seconds to hit his eye before the damn thing goes blue AGAIN and trolls you for having better speed gears.\n\nFrankly, the second boss in the Wily stages is a pushover if you have a W-tank, as are the Wily Machine and capsule-esque.

Some examples include Mega Man getting the knockback from damage right away instead of being gradually pushed back for the duration of the stun, or how Mega Man's hitbox is a bit larger, so you can lean further off ledges, but as a result you'll also bump your head on low ceilings easier too.\n\nI didn't like the Double Gear system at first, but as I played the game and got more used to it, I actually started to really like it.

I had no issues with the gameplay experince. Controls are tighter than my ass. The game's engine finds a way to make the controls as close to their classic counterpart as possible; yet has many modren tweaks that make some stages play better than they ever have before with similar concepts. \n\nTHE GOOD: \n-Tundraman's stage is my #1 favorite, I love it! You go fast, and shoot stuff, wonderful!\n-Rush Coil and Jet being on the top and far right button of your joypad makes perfect sense, and feels great.\n-Right-Stick to change weapons on the fly, and click in the right stick to switch back to the buster is a clutch/time saver.\n-Sliding feels a bit stiff when constantly dashing, however! Being able to now slide back and forth, while keeping your sliding height feels awesome, and helps out a lot with dodging. \n-Gear System, I found myself loving the speed gear (although not using it too awful much, it makes quick work of mid-bosses and some platforming areas.)\n-The graphics are great, and I think they'll age well over time. Game comes in japanese and english, a great perk if you're bilingual, or find megaman's english voice to be to manly. (sorry Ben.)\n-My rig is old, like REALLY old. So I found it some-what suprising that I could run the game with all the (few) settings they allow, and had v-sync on without any frame drops. I'd recommend keeping vsync on to be honest; game can get fast at times and if the screen were to tear, I think it might take away from the exp.\n\n\nNeutral (eh): \n-Main game's pretty short, but solid, and well crafted.\n-Music, nothing outstanding (apart from the stage select theme imo) But nothing bad, it's all is fitting to the stage/boss.\n-No Protoman or Bass in this title. Maybe they'll be added at a later date, or in the next game. \n-English V/O(Voice over) Isn't great. The acting is totally fine, but the inflection sounds wrong. Stick with included Japanese Voice. \n-Rush Jet is kinda useless. I pray for the day they go back to Megaman 3's style of rushjet, but then I guess it'd be too strong.\n-Rush Coil and Jet use the same energy bar; not a huge deal, but something to consider while playing. \n\nCons: \n-Bounceman stage is annoying, but it's not a deal breaker at all. (Think somewhere between Springman from Megaman7 and Clownman from Megaman 8) \n\nKeep up the good work!!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1538901713, "timestamp_updated": 1538901713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604745030403137207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45153031": {"recommendationid": "45153031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282088832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 502, "last_played": 1561829185}, "language": "english", "review": "The majority of megaman games (except 7 which was 16 bit and 8 which was 32 bit) were 8 bit affairs.  This game is 2.5D with stylized 3D models and I actually like it a lot. It's about time this franchise modernized. \n\nLike most of the Megaman series this is a difficult platformer. However, unlike the rest of the series it has a lot of mechanics that make the platforming pretty fun. The Gear system really compliments Megamans jump and shoot gameplay and all of the levels and the bosses seem to be designed to compliment it. \n\nIf you are not used to playing Megaman games or old school platformers Capcom has thankfully added lower difficulty settings which is pretty neat. In addition if you keep losing you can also go back to the in game shop and power Megaman up which in a way lets \"grind\" out an easy difficulty. \n\nI thought the music was pretty good though at times the synthesized sounds get repetitive. It's not Megaman 2 or 3 music good but, its fine and has few catchy tunes.\n\nOnly thing I don't really like about the game is the lack of extras after you beat it. No extra characters (Roll, Protoman, and Bass) and only the challenge mode for replay value. \n\nI got it for about $23 discount deal I think that is the right price for this game.

As you play it more, you get better at using the new tools like the gear system to your advantage. \n+ The gear system and special weapons feel FUN to use. These weapons are a useful bunch in comparison to other classic series entries.\n+ UI and Character Design is very clean. The Robot Master designs are some of the best in the series, and the fights are very fun.\n+ The story cutscenes are better overall compared to other Mega Man games, which should be applauded. Most of the voice acting is also pretty good!\n+ Challenge Mode and Time Trials add a lot for experienced players to play the levels in new ways.\n\nCons:\n- Some levels (Block Man, Impact Man, Wily 1) are just too long or needlessly frustrating, especially for newcomers. The scarcity of checkpoints on \"Normal\" difficulty is a little ridiculous. You can add checkpoints and take less damage / no instant-deaths, but the level layouts are the same on all difficulties, so it doesn't really help new players adjust very well.\n- The end-game isn't very satisfying as there are only 2 real WIly Stages and then 3 and 4 are just boss fights. Maybe this was because the main levels are longer than usual, they thought we wanted less of them? In any case, it feels less satisying to complete because of this.\n- The entirety of Wily 1 including the boss. This level is a mess of half-finished ideas and enemy spam. Also, returning boss fight from hell that no one likes.\n- The knockback is really frustrating because it added extra time where the player cannot act and this feels TERRIBLE. Getting hit feels really frustrating at ANY point in this game.\n\n\nOverall, my annoyances are very minor and the positives outweight the negatives. This Mega Man game has slid up the ranks in my favorites and lands squarely in my top 5, as it does enough new things and has some quality boss fights and weapons to make up for the greivances.

I played using the Switch Pro Controller and it worked flawlessly. \n\nHowever, the difficulty is all over the place, which was my largest complaint. Sure, you have the various actual difficulty settings, but I'm just talking about Normal mode. If you start running through the stages like you would in the NES era, you're going to get stomped and trolled hard by the stages.\n\nYou quickly realize that the way to beat the game and make it feel like classic Mega Man is to get bolts and buy upgrade items, including lives and tanks. However, it's so incredibly easy to grind for bolts  that you can easily destroy any trace of difficulty that the game has, as many of the upgrades are overpowered. Sure, it can be fun to get that RPG level-up sensation, but you don't want to get bored. And Mega Man puts too much of that responsibility in the hands of the player isntead of designing the game to have balance.\n\nUpgrades are not, some of the stages simply have too many spikes  and frustrating mechanics (don't get my started on Bounce Man's stage), as well as sometimes being too long. When you die and get sent back, sometimes it's a long, long way and it's simply discouraging rather than being a slight annoyance like back in the NES days. \n\nOn the other hand, the special weapons this time around are a blast, and the game's signature double gear system adds much needed variety, if not further muddying the waters of difficulty. You can use the trigger buttons to either slow down the action or boost/change your special abilites to a stronger version. The abilites feel more useful than usual, and experimenting with them is fun. \n\nYou have access to both English and Japanese voice acting, with Japanese being the better option in my opinion. The story is simple, but gives some extra depth to the Wily and Light relationship, and even makes Wily feel like more of a sympathetic character. But don't worry, it's not too text heavy or over-complicated. \n\nI expect I might enjoy this game more on a replay than on my initial run, now that I have a better feel for the upgrades and how they affect gameplay. And replay value is high, for certain. \n\nYou probably already know whether you're going to buy this, but I'll just say that I think the game is worth it, but really could have used some more fine tuning before release.", "timestamp_created": 1538862262, "timestamp_updated": 1538862301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45145958": {"recommendationid": "45145958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018898899", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 537, "last_played": 1539710157}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the one Mega Man fans have been waiting for.\n\n[b] What You\u2019re in For\t[/b]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Fully-customizable controls.\n\n    [*]4 difficulties catering to everyone from newbie to the hardest of the hardcore.\n\n    [*]New Double Gear system has allowed the designers to create much more challenging and interesting levels overall where players can choose to take the purist approach or make use of the slow-mo and buster power-ups it grants to fine-tune the difficulty on the fly.\n\n    [*]Each level is thematically distinct with its own compelling twist on the Mega Man formula.\n\n    [*]Boss battles are more dynamic than ever, each with unique phases that dramatically alter the flow of the fight.\n\n    [*]Particle effects like hit sparks and explosions have been rendered in a cartoon-like, hand-drawn style, which really helps to sell the moment-to-moment action\n\n    [*]Top-notch animation really breathes life into the cast.

Jesus H. Christ...[/b]\n\n[h1]Mehga Mehn[/h1]\n\nYeah header says it all... the ELEVENTH FUCKING ENTRY to a basically dead franchise / series that seems to never want to WRAP IT UP B!, WRAP UP THAT GAVEL B! and tie the two best entries in the franchise together... Not sure when Crapcom is going to tie the plot lines from Mega Man to Mega Man X but it won't be in my lifetime that's for certain.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nYeah it's Mega Man... now with extra frames of animation even worse than the likes of Mega Man 8, the knock back is unreal in this game as well, you can buy a power up in the shop that reduces the knock back by 50% but that only brings it back down to standard Mega Man levels of knock back... so they purposefully make bumping in to any enemies a death sentance if you're near the edge of a pit until you buy this power up.\n\nSo there's this \"new\" Double Gear System, how does it work? Well it's simple... you hit the RB on your controller to slow down time, and again, there's a power up that enhances this broken ability so you move at normal speed during the slow down, otherwise you move only about 20% faster than most enemies initially. \n\nWhen you hit the LB Mega Man goes in to a power fueled rage and does double damage with his Mega Buster, can fire a red energy shot or an ultimate shot that pretty much decimates anything it touches but over heats you, I dunno I barely ever used it. Slowing down time is a lot more beneficial to you over all, especially after the first boss you kill, right after Googling the boss weakness order that is...\n\nYou only have a finite amount of time in each of these modes, you have a bar, it fills red, when you shut off the over clocking it will reduce the bar but if you stay in overclock mode you'll over heat. If the bar fills completely it will put you in a weakened state... So basically what I'm saying is, don't let the bar fill, like ever. Firing off Mega Mans Ultimate shot will instantly put you in that weakened state as well but it pretty much kills any normal enemy / mini boss in a single hit and will take off about 30% of a bosses life bar... again, not sure, never really used it much... no need.\n\nThe game difficulty is spiked against you on Superhero mode, like it's pretty tough. It's about Mega Man 9 tough, let's just put it that way. Normal mode is a good place to be generally, it's difficulty is around Mega Man 4 or 5... fairly balanced... anything lower and you're going in to Mega Man 2 and 3 territory for difficulty... really easy.\n\nAuto is back, so the shop is back, bolts are back, so you know, go hack your bolts with cheat engine and start buying up the shop... you can hold 9 E tanks, 9 W tanks and 1 M tank... this is literally overkill, the game isn't this hard. Beat can rescue you from pits, Eddie can deliver a random crap item and you can get spike guards if you die 5 times to spikes.\n\nOn Superhero mode, you'll take tons of damage from normal enemies so be careful. Mega Man 4's Mega Buster is back again, which means if you're charging a shot and get hit... yup, you guessed it... gotta charge that shot again.\n\nThe Boss weapons are actually really well done though, I will give this game some credit for that, they are all generally useful at one point or another. The only weapon I found rather pointless was the block dropper for the most part, it's rather situational... same with Blast Man's weapon... it's meh. Other than that, at least 6 of 8 weapons have great utility.\n\nAlso, no Protoman, no Bass... why? I have a good idea. They seemed to be utilizing those extra characters well but I guess they wanted to go back to basics and make this strictly a Mega Man only title... Which I'm fine with honestly because I was starting to get the impression that Mega Man is a total basic bitch. Bass is far superior to play with and a lot more fun and that was kind of ruining it for me... this is Mega Man, not Bass Man... you want that shit go play Mega Maker.\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\n\nNothing new... literally. Wily drudges up an old grudge that he just seemingly forgot about this entire time. Wily has a nightmare about this old grudge and wakes up wanting to make life miserable for Dr. Light.... surprise, surprise.\n\nAgain Mega Man 1 style, Wily kidnaps Dr. Lights Robots and reprograms them with his overclocking system he developed so as to finally stop Mega Man... but of course, you can't stop Mega Man so Dr. Light takes a chance, AGAIN, and installs Wily's experimental overclock system in to Mega Man. Dr. Light trusts that Mega Man will do the right thing with his new found abilities...AGAIN, and go out and put an end to Dr. Wily's madness....AGAIN...zZzzzzZZZzzzzZzzzzzzzzzzzz....\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\n\nNon-existant... literally. Can't even remember a single track from this game, and I beat it about 3 times in less than 6 hours... not even sure if there was music really, a complete shame really. Mega Man is known for it's rockin' soundtracks and somewhere in there, they just forgot to include one in this game... not kidding, I can't remember a single song, it just felt like background noise... nothing memorable.\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\n\nShameless cash grab, nothing more, we fell for it. They wanted to stick it to Inafune for betraying them with Mighty No. 9... well I can honestly say, nothing will ever replace Mega Man, which is something Inafune should have realized... Mega Man 11 is far superior to Mno.9 but it's still just a mediocre title at best.\n\nHot garbage really... the art design was cool, I enjoyed the weapons and creativity they put forth in designing said weapons but the rest was just meh. The slow down gimmick was just that, a total gimmick, I didn't enjoy that double gear / overclock system one bit, felt tacked on and the game could have been fine without it.\n\nRush has his own hot keys now which makes for some flashy jump maneuvers for speed running the game, Coil and Jet though... they decided to keep it basic this time around... Rush Marine was still the best 3rd utility Rush could have ever had and I would like to see its return, but that would mean they'd have to make another MM game and I think this game just tapped me out completely... I'm just over Mega Man.\n\n6.5 / 10... it's alright. There are much better MM games out there that make you feel better about playing them... This game is just a souless, shameless entry to get back at Keiji Inafune and honestly, if Keiji was involved, it probably wouldn't have been much better because that guy's ideas are out to fucking lunch.\n\nMM is dead... just deal with it. \n\nBuy it on sale... don't pay full.\n\nI never want to see another MM game as long as I live... not unless they intend to do something drastic like introduce Zero in to it...", "timestamp_created": 1538805859, "timestamp_updated": 1539035717, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.266278505325317383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45130979": {"recommendationid": "45130979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060140640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1866, "last_played": 1688276746}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll admit I'm a bit biased when it comes to Mega Man but oh my DAYS is Mega Man 11 so fun.

Levels feel much longer compared to earlier entries. The stages are enjoyable, and the challenge is tough but fair. The new double gear system is a nice edition to the formula without feeling too foreign to the traditional gameplay: granting the player either enhanced power or to slow down time for better mobility.  This system is heavily encouraged through gameplay, which may make Mega Man purests a little uneasy, but it is not impossible to play without.\n You have access to an item shop inbetween levels where you can buy consumable items (extra lives, energy tanks, weapon refills etc.) and parts, which act as permanent upgrades. These upgrades help alleviate some minor stresses of playing such as not having to hold the button to charge your shots, or having weapon ammo refill all your weapons instead of just one. The parts are a nice reward without taking away from the game's overall challenge.\n Special bonus features such as gallery mode and additional challenges with leaderboards are there for those looking for more which is a nice bonus.\n\nThe Cons: The music is a little uninspired, which is disappointing considering the history of great music in the Mega Man series. If you have access to the arranged soundtrack DLC, I highly recomend replacing the standard soundtrack with the special instrumental track, as those are much nicer to listen too. The art style may be a matter of preferance to some players, as the colors are not quite as bold as the days of sprite-art.\n\nOverall, it's a welcome revival of the Mega Man series, and a refreshingly tough one at that.\n", "timestamp_created": 1538775421, "timestamp_updated": 1538775421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45125436": {"recommendationid": "45125436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050495484", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 277, "last_played": 1538850904}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty good game, all things considered.\nseriously. we don't want this franchise from going into hibernation again. support it as much as possible!", "timestamp_created": 1538774765, "timestamp_updated": 1538774765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504354476928710938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45124971": {"recommendationid": "45124971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065514168", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1540850931}, "language": "english", "review": "As a life long Mega Man fan, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.

I can now say with relief that Capcom absolutely nailed it. I love the gameplay and the aesthetics of MM11. The controls are solid, the stages are unique, and the bosses are show stealers.\n\nGone is MM8-10's idiotic habit of removing fundamental mechanics for no good reason. You have the full and iconic Mega Man arsenal at your disposal. E-Tanks, Rush Coil, Rush Jet, sliding, charge shots, etc... These are joined by the largest shop in the series, with plenty of  old and new items. The game is properly designed around a fully powered Mega Man so that none of these abilities and goodies feel over-powered or under-utilized.\n\nStages are tough, but feature a fair learning curve. Some tend to be a touch on the long side. The only complaint I have so far is that the length can make backtracking after dying to a mid-boss or boss frustrating. Plenty of bolts for E-Tanks and 1-ups helps to mitigate that problem, thankfully. The stages themselves are reasonably attractive. What really stands out are the wonderful background details. Scenes such as Metools sitting around a bonfire or Block Man's adorable hieroglyphics give a great deal of charm to the stages.  \n\nThe boss fights are some of the more imaginitive in the series. They are very much on the difficult side, but none of them feel like you won't be able to master them with practice. Added to that, each boss is given a fully-formed personality to shape their fights and make each one memorable. (<3 Tundra Man.)\n\nThe mechanics are solid, and the new double gear system is a worthy addition. It's simple, useful, and unobtrusive. You'll never feel annoyed at having to use it, and learning to complete harder sections without it is quite satisfying. Two small control problems did arise. First, Mega Man's ladder climbing speed is glacial. It feels slower than Mega Man 1&2's painfully slow ladder climbing, and that is quite an accomplishment. Also Mega Man seems to bonk his head occasionally trying to jump through narrow gaps. This is particularly a problem with Torch Man's stage. These are minor gripes on what is otherwise a game that matches or surpasses the earlier games' controls. \n\nIn short-- This is the game I've been waiting for.

And man it doesn't dissapoint. \n\nPresentation:\n\nThe graphics are colorful and nice. I am not one of those people who hate the idea of this game being 8 bit or modern graphics. To me the 8 bit sprties will always look great and age better in the end but that being said this game looks really good. They also took advantage of the higher quality graphics by making stages have a lot of unique nods. I love Blast man's stage for example thanks to all those billboards in the background.\n\nThe music is nice but I need to give it a few more listen to it. With megaman 9 and 10  (and all the other megaman games except 5 maybe)  every track stuck to my head in my first playthrough but not so much with this one. It also has to dow ith how loud everything can be so I will play around with configurations and do a second run (well more like 50 more runs , I am a big megaman nut)\n\nThe voice acting I really love. All of the voices are fitting especially Willy's . Infact this is my fav voice for him. I especially love how the actor gets into his lines during the final battle. It actually kinda made me emotional and feel bad for Willy.\n\nThe stages:\n\nThey are all fun imo. Everyone mentions how anoying Bounce Man's stage is but I don't know I never had any problems. I just hold the jump button and no directional movement and boom I am done. Now the stages do have a few \"gotcha\" moments which annoyed me. I mean 9 and 10 were pretty good with this but this game not so much. Its only a problem during your first playthrough though and if you are like me only a few moments will get you.\n\nMy fav stage is probably Tundra Man's stage so far. I love how fast it can be. Reminds me of Commando Man's stage from megaman 10 which is always a good thing.\n\n\nThe weapons:\nA lot of people usually say that the weapons in megaman games are not that good but I HIGHLY disagree with that. 1 , 2 ,4 ,7 , 9 and 10 are filled with amazing weapons (especially 4 and 9 ). And honestly this game has some great weapons. There are a lot of moments during stages where the weapons are super useful. It might be an enemy that is hard to reach or the weapon might just destroy a mini boss combined with the power gear. If I had to rank the weapons in this game , well , I would put them on par with the ones in 4 but not quite as 9. To be fair though the weapons in 9 are just godly. It might be the only game where the effs of the weapons can be combined too now that I think about it.\n\n\nThe gear system:\nOur new toy for this game and how do I feel about it? Well most people say that the speed gear is good but the power gear is useless but honestly I am the opposite. I LOVE the power gear. I always combine it with certain weapons and it just DESTROYS the minibosses when combined with the right weapon. The speed gear is good for dodgin certain boss attacks but I never felt like I had to use it to dodge an attack which I like. My fav thing about this system is that it is not MANDATORY. A lot of people say that there should have been more sections in stages to make these things useful but honestly I prefer it this way. Its all about your creativity to make them useful. The potential for this thing is pretty great and I can't wait to try it out more in my future runs. \n\nIronic considering how I was not a fan of this sytem from the beginning but now I love it.\n\nThe charge and slide:\n.....I never liked these. Why? Well not so much the slide but the charge shot means one thing. The devs want to make this thing feel useful so they make a lot of the enemies take more hits than they need to and the bosses have more eye frames. Meaning you NEED to use it if you wanna have a good time during bosses. 9 and 10 fixed this problem by making the eye frames shorter meaning a normal buster shot was enough to beat a boss with ease AND if you were playing as Protoman you had the CHOICE the OPTION to use it. It was never needed to have a good time. That beeing said there is an auto-charge upgrade in this game meaning I can just equip that during boss fights and not have to worry about holding my thumb on that cursed fire button.\n\nAnd the slide killed me more than it helped me.\n\n\nFew things in general:\nThis game kinda does away with a lot of the things that 9 and 10 perfected. The slide is kinda like megaman 8 slide which is bad, the latter climbing speed is slow just like in 1 and 2 and the movement is not as fluent as it was in 9 and 10 (still good but not as good). Also the knockback , this is the only megaman game where it bothers me. Sure there is an item that you can buy but whats the point. Just give me the normal knockback from 9 and 10. Also where are Proto man and Bass? Those 2 were great in 9 and 10 and increased replayability. \n\nSo overall my opinion on this game is that it is great. It is probably my 3rd fav in the series (9 and 10 taking the first 2 spots). This is a great game and I can't wait to replay it.

Wow. Just saying the name blows my mind. Where do I start with this masterpiece?\n\nThe best way to sum this game up is \"damn\".\nDamn this game is pretty\nDamn this game is fun\nDamn this game is addictive\nDamn this game is a throwback\nDamn this game was worth the wait\nDamn this game is well-made\nDamn this game is slick\nJust.... Damn.\n\nNow there are flaws of course, I mean really there is no such thing as a truly flawless game. Although these flaws are few and far between.\nFor starters, the main controversy is that you don't get to jump through the door to the boss as a transition (I personally don't care about this but I have to add it as a \"flaw\" because I might get hunted down if I don't). The game has a pretty dumb plot but then again it is the 11th installment in the core series so I can let it pass. Each stage works the same way as the original 6 as well as 9 and 10: pick a stage and beat it, BUT THERE'S A CATCH!\nYou  now don't have to just jump and shoot to progress through the level. There are new mechanics like the Slow-Down powerup and of course the Boost powerup. Also the Rush Coil has its own button which is amazing. I found myself using the Slow-Down and Boost barely ever yet I used the Rush Coil A LOT to get to hard to reach places or even just for convenience. The 2 new game mechanics can be combined although it drains your power meter in seconds so it's pretty much not worth doing unless you got a really good reason to.\n\nThere are new parts in the puzzle section of each stage, keeping you on your toes.\nThe voice acting is decent, although when you go to Dr. Light's Lab for items and whatnot, Roll and Dr. Light call you Mega and honestly I find that uncomfourting since no one calls him Mega. Really gives me some Jack Torrance-style cabin fever hahaha.\n\nThe game is the length of an average Mega Man game but constantly throws new things at you and it is really fantastic for doing that. During every Game Over screen or completion of a stage, you have the ability to save your progress which is also really fantastic. The game is extremely addictive already but with the save slots added it makes it way more fun to progress and then play again once you beat it. It feels like a true Mega Man game, one that goes back to the style of the old games but also keeps things fresh and original.\n\nThe robot masters you face now are Block Man, Fuse Man, Blast Man, Torch Man, Impact Man, Bounce Man, Tundra Man and Acid Man respectively.\nAcid Man is the stage I started out with on my first playthrough and it is honestly one of the most fun stages in the whole game as well as a great music loop to accompany it.\nI don't want to spoil much about the stages but yea they're really good.\n\nOverall, Mega Man 11 is an excellent sequel.

Speaking of, the Double Gear System - the game's selling point - is a fun, unique, and interesting new mechanic that adds a fresh twist to the already fresh and fluid gameplay Mega Man 11 has to offer.

It's either a bad game, a mediocre game or a decent game. The more you use the shops, the more you use the bolts, the more you scum sections with rush and the more you take advantage of the gear system, the more you think about the fact that most enemies are paper; The worse it is.

You'll get your jollies if you like Jump N' Shoot Man. You've probably already bought it if you like Mega Man, but if you haven't, give it a go. Give it a fair chance, and you'll like it.

I've played lots and lots of megaman games and was so sad to hear that they weren't going to produce any more megaman games.\n\nBut then [b]WHAM[/b] they fucking hit me in the face with a suprise attack game that I didn't even see coming.\n\nSo how is it?\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\n[b]This game looks awesome![/b] The levels look really well done and have beautiful views, amazing parallaxing, and they still feel true to the old megaman style. I love it!\n\nAs for the fx, things such as the boss attack effects, mega buster charges, and explosions look [i]cool[/i]! It's both stylistic with a more 'realistic' look to it at the same time.\n\n[h1]Music:[/h1]\n\nThe music is awesome! I really enjoy the soundtrack, it feels just as modern as the graphics. Toight!\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\n\nNo spoilers here. I just want to say that the story mostly follows the same sort of format as earlier megaman classic games, which is a good thing! I enjoy the story itself, though, I feel like it really develops the characters of Dr. Light and Dr. Wily a lot, which makes them even more interesting!\n\n[h1]Voice acting:[/h1]\n\nThey got this one right. Ooooh they did a good job on voice acting in this game! No childish megaman, no DOKTOR WAHWEE AND DE ENERGEE WESOURCES, no WHAAAAT AM I FIGHTTTINNNGG FORRRRR (Even though they were fuckin' golden). I enjoyed every voice in this, they really connect with how the characters look.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nOkay, here's where Megaman 11 gets [i]really[/i] good. You've got your classic megaman moveset: Move left/right, jump, shoot, charge (2 levels normally, same as old school charging), and special weapons. However, this game introduces an amazing mechanic: The double gear system. Feel free to look at the spoiler if you want to know more about it instead of finding out yourself (It's really cool to find out how everything works and looks yourself!)\n\n[spoiler]\n\nSo the double gear system gives you two main 'modes' you can swap between: [i]Speed gear[/i] and [b]Power gear[/b].\nEach uses a shared energy gauge which does NOT work like special weapon energy. Instead, it's a seperate cooldown bar that slowly overheats as you use each gear, and slowly cools down when you're not using any gears.\n\nSpeed gear allows you to slow down time, which allows for easier dodging, platforming, spam shots, and really just breather time. It's a very nice mechanic that makes the game more accessable for players that find megaman to be too tough normally, or who just want a smoother experience with the game. I enjoy it a lot.\n\nPower gear increases your damage output. Your uncharged/level 1 charge shots will be doubled (Meaning two shots for one button press), plus you will have TWO extra charge levels (One that charges up at a good speed after the normal max charge, and one that charges up for the whole duration of power gear (Meaning you'll have to spend your entire power gear time charging it up) for a massive blast that destroys enemies.), however the max charge level can be lost if you get hit during it, making it a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. \n\nAny special weapons used with power gear will be extra powerful, as if they were charged. You cannot charge special weapons.\n\nLastly, at roughly 4-5 health left you can press both gear buttons at once to [b]DOUBLE UP[/b], activating both gears until they're both overheated (You cannot cancel out of this process). Your max charge level will charge quicker in this state, meaning you can usually get 2 max charged shots before it runs out.\n\nThis is meant as a last resort attack, as once it is over you can only fire 1 buster shot at a time and cannot charge your shots until the overheated gear charge meter slowly goes back to 0%. VERY high-risk high-reward play, which is my kinda thing!\n\nAlso, while gears are overheated, they cannot be used again until they are fully cooled down.\n\nAlso also, bosses have access to the gear system as well :)\n[/spoiler]\n\nThis game also uses the part system from megaman 8 (And I'm sure other megaman games), which I enjoy quite a bit. I didn't enjoy it as much as how megaman 8 did it, but it still is a very good system.\n\nThe bosses are very fun and feel a lot like megaman x bosses, I won't spoil much about them. Their personalities and voice acting is awesome, and they feel like well developed characters in my mind.\n\nThe powers themselves are also very fun to use, it still stays true to the old megaman format.\n\nSo, the main question:\n\n[h1]Is it worth 30$?[/h1]\n\nIf you're a die-hard megaman fan, this is definitely the game for you. It is VERY fun for a megaman game and the new gear mechanic adds a lot of spice to the already fun gameplay. This game follows the old megaman format heavily, so you'll get a LOT of nostalgia from seeing some familiar faces!\n\nIf you're playing megaman for the first time, it can also be a lot of fun. This can be a great first megaman game, as the speed gear really lets you adjust the difficulty to how you see fit, while not being overpowered.\n\nI payed 30$ for this game and I did not regret it one bit. I thoroughly enjoyed every last bit of this game and I hope you do as well if you're thinking of picking it up!

Graphics, music, and  charm are amazing too, and the challenges and extra content are great too.

The stages and bosses are generally speaking well designed and the Double Gear system feels more like optional training wheels rather than an absolute necessity, which is great for newcomers and casuals alike.\n\nWhile Rock's runcycle is a bit iffy, the overall art direction is pleasing to the eyes and nothing feels out-of-place; It definitely is what I imagined a modern Mega Man game would look like, graphically. Soundtrack however is a bit forgettable, with only a very few tracks standing out, though the instrumental tracks improves nearly every stage theme, I found. Shame though that it seems to be pre-order exclusive only, at least as of this review's posting.\n\nIn conclusion, MM11 is a very good start for what I'm hoping to be a new Mega Man revival, and one that won't be over after just two games.

(Although it doesn't focus much, not only it explained why Light and Wily are like oil and water, but also strengthen the connection between Classic and X series)\n + The best voice acting in the whole series. (Again, for obvious reason)\n + The best level design I've ever seen. (You guessed it, for obvious reason)\n + The best-looking Mega Man Classic game today. (although it's so obivous, I hate to see Mega Man 11 or later will be in 8-bit, which may hurt its presentation)\n + The control is as tight as it used to be.\n + This game isn't easy, but no cheap death and bullsh*t pixel perfect timing requirement.(look at YOU: Quick Man's stage, First-run Heat Man's stage, Boobeam Trap boss fight, etc.)\n + The weapons are obviously powerful and easily the best, but not as overpowered as the famous Metal Blade, which is a good thing because none of them break the game. They use for what they should be in the first place: covering the attack that Mega Buster can't normally reach.\n + Double Gear system is a welcome addition to the series and it's related to the storyline. No-Double-Gear-System playthrough is possible. Again, Double Gear doesn't break the game.\n + High replay value.\n + OMG, they added a new method to kill Mettaur (charge shot him will make him reveal his weakness)? So Mettaur is finally dethroned? F&&& YEAH!\n + Holy sh*t, you can stop during slide??? Am I f&&&ing dreaming???\n\nBad:\n - Rush Jet got nerfed ... again (cost 2 bars instead of 1 unlike previous games. Wait, Rush Jet is in MM8?)\n - System requirements (at minimum) demand higher than it should.\n - Keyboard doesn't have a complete control configuration. (I can't change the menu button?)\n - Extra Life, E-Tanks, and W-Tanks won't respawn after collected ... permanently.\n - There is no indicator of how to unlock all parts even though all conditions make sense (you still have to \"buy\" them after unlocked)\n - The soundtrack is good, but very forgettable. (isn't Mega Man well-known for amazing and memorable soundtrack?)\n - Dr.Light's Lab (A.K.A the shop) can tone down the difficulty, so ignore it forever if you want a maximum challenge.\n\nIf you're new to the series, this (or Mega Man 2) is your best starter kit. If you're looking for an old-school platformer challenge, it's worth $30. However, if you just want to play the game in 1 playthrough only, I recommend you to wait for the sale.\n\n(Final words as a Mega Man fan) After all those years that Capcom thought Mega Man franchise was no longer relevant, and we all know it's their fault for releasing way, WAY too much Mega Man games in 2000s. I'm so glad that my old friend back after 8 years of \"retirement\", and THIS is the Mega Man Classic game that I've ALWAYS looked forward to. I'm grateful to see MM11's presentation step up with the modern era, not stay in 8-bit for the sake of nostalgia and low budget as possible. This showed how much effort Capcom dev team put into it. And now, the only thing I can do right now is wait and see if the game sell well or not because I really want to see the series continue.\n\nAnyway, Welcome back, old friend! ;w\\)\n\n[spoiler]Update: I sense something similiar to Double Gear System, and they were already introduced before ... hmmm ...

I didn't know if Capcom could pull off a successful entry in the series after it's been so long. What if they lost touch? Would they take an entirely different style that crossed a line that shouldn't be? Well, I'm happy to report that the game has exceeded [i]almost[/i] every expectation of mine. I'll explain in brief what the game does and doesn't do right.\n\n[h1]The Feel[/h1]\n\nWhen I saw the 2.D style, I was immediately concerned of the possibility of the game lacking the tight, snappy, and satisfying physics of the games of old. In particular, I was worried about the game turning out feeling clunky and slow like Mega Man 8. Thankfully, this game feels very close to the 8-bit games, with some minor nuances and differences. If you are familiar with the Classic Mega Man games, you should feel right at home.\n\n[h1]The Gears[/h1]\n\nBy now, you've likely seen the trailers, so you understand what the gears are. The Speed Gear is particularly very useful, adding a bullet-time mechanic that lets you platform and shoot more effectively while slowing the flow of time around you. On the other hand, the Power Gear is an incredibly awesome way to enhance your weapons almost in the vein of Mega Man X. You can use it to dump a hoard of bricks, a far-reaching air dash, and a literal screen nuke. They're great, once you get used to them. Best part? You can complete the entire game without touching them once. They are optional. If someone says otherwise, they simply have yet to stop relying on the gears to win. The mechanic is seemlessly incorporated into the core Mega Man experience, and I had a lot of fun with it.\n\n[h1]The Stages[/h1]\n\nI won't beat around the bush. The stages here in 11 are definitely the longest on average of the classic series. They feel about 25% longer than the ones in past games, but the good news is that despite this, they keep throwing new and interesting challenges at you that makes each stage memorable and fun. Just like in the past, the challenges are fair, but difficult, and you must keep a sharp eye out to learn how to bypass them safely. \n\n[h1]The Bosses[/h1]\n\nIn what probably benefits from the style shift the most, the bosses this time definitely have more life to them and their fights are executed in some of the best ways I've seen in the series. Each one not only sports an appealing design, but they all come with multiple phases utilizing the gears. Yet, if you're familiar with past Mega Man games, you should know what to expect for the most part. \n\n[h1]The Music[/h1]\n\nYeah, this is definitely the most controversial part of this game. The songs are definitely taking a more synthy EDM style here than in the past, but most of them are catchy and simple enough to remember. Ones I enjoy specifically being Fuse Man, Bounce Man, and Acid Man.\n\n[h1]The Content[/h1]\n\nOutside of the main game which is as replayable as past games in the series, depending on who you are, there are some challenge modes that are fun, but overall not that staggering. They're simple Time Attack, Score Attack, etc. type of modes with some neat ideas like Balloon Rush and Jump Saver. Fun, but only for a while. \n\nAlso. this may change with DLC, but the lack of Endless Attack and any appearance of Proto Man and Bass whatsoever leaves me disappointed in that regard. Especially the latter. I hope to see them in future updates. \n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nA great Mega Man game, with possibly the best and most versatile set of Special Weapons yet. Hopefully this is a sign for the series to make a full comeback at last.

I had been eagerly waiting for Mega Man 11 since the moment I watched the original trailer.  As excited as I was, I still held some concerns.  It has been 8 years since Capcom\u2019s long running series received a new entry.  I wondered how the game would be with a new graphical style.  After all, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time they tried to depart from the classic NES style with mixed results.  I\u2019m happy to say that Capcom did a great job with Mega Man 11.\n\nDeep story lines were never the draw of this series and that doesn\u2019t change here. To absolutely no one\u2019s surprise Dr. Wily is at it again and it\u2019s Mega Man\u2019s job to thwart his schemes.  There is a bit of information revealed about Dr.Wily and Dr. Light\u2019s past that is used to set up the new gear system mechanic.\n\nThere are two gears.  The speed gear allows the player to slow down time and the power gear increases Mega Man\u2019s damage output.  When I first learned about it I was worried that the entire game would be geared around it and the use of gears would be required.  I played through on normal and can confirm that at no point is it mandatory.  That said, the gears are very powerful and will make the game easier for the player if utilized.\n\nBeyond the gear system there have been a few quality of life upgrades.  Rush jet/coil now have dedicated buttons and weapons can be quickly swapped with the right analog stick.  There were a few times where I accidentally swapped weapons by tapping the analog stick.  It didn\u2019t bother me much, but it\u2019s worth mentioning that it\u2019s possible to turn the feature off in the options menu.  Other changes include ditching the classic boss door transition motion freeze as well as health pick up freeze.  I would have liked to keep the boss door transition but it\u2019s not a big enough issue to bother me much.\n\nAside from some minor changes it\u2019s still Mega Man.  There are eight robot masters followed by Wily stages. I wasn\u2019t hoping for anything more than that, though I must admit the Wily portion of the game felt shorter than usual.  In addition to the main game there are quite a few extra challenges, most of which feature leaderboards.  If you\u2019re new to the series it\u2019s probably a good place to start as Capcom has made the game especially accessible via the gear system, multiple difficulty options, and generous currency drops for the in game shop. But if you do start here I imagine it would be difficult to go back to some of the older games after playing this one. The game is what I hoped it would be and I\u2019d recommend it to veterans of the series without hesitation.", "timestamp_created": 1538623637, "timestamp_updated": 1538624305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521276593208312988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45093828": {"recommendationid": "45093828", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978674491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 1483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1078, "last_played": 1552403847}, "language": "english", "review": "Summary: They got it right!\n\nMega Man 11 is a revival of the 30 (or 31 if you're from Japan) year old series, and it seriously seems like they listened to fan input along the way. Mega Man regains all of his core moves: running and jumping, but also sliding and charge shot. In addition, if you wish to use the gears, you absolutely can. They enhance your speed and your weapons, but overall they make the game easier. You can actually beat the full game buster only, and that's one of the areas in which they were clearly listening to the fans.\n\nThe controls are tight as ever, though bear in mind that using a wireless controller or analog stick will not effectively replicate the feel of the classic series in its prime. Thankfully, there is generic gamepad support, even though it uses Xbox button icons to represent said gamepad's buttons and can get confusing. Want to play on an SNES controller? No problem -- I finished the game doing so! You'll need a couple more buttons to use everything, however.\n\nOf note, Mega Man's jump distance has been increased by around 25%, likely to facilitate the switch to widescreen. Aside from that, however, it'll feel more like playing Mega Man 4 or 5 than any other title.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, though the perspectives used in cutscenes are a bit limited. Obviously core gameplay should lock it as is done, but cutscenes don't need to be beholden to these limitations. The audio is catchy as ever, though default settings really drown out its wonderful soundtrack. I'd recommend adjusting the voices and SFX down a bit before beginning.\n\nIf you're worried about replayability, challenges have you covered. The developers made good use of the fairly short roster of maps to design some clever, if not incredibly evil challenges. Getting gold on them will keep you busy for quite some time.\n\nA few people have mentioned slowdown issues similar to those experienced in the Legacy Collections. Luckily, I didn't experience this, in spite of having slowdown in LC2 and XLC1. It seems to be fairly rare.\n\nThat aside, with the difficulty vets expect and the easier difficulty settings making it accessible to newcomers, this is a fantastic run-and-gun for anyone.\n(also, I will throw my money at any Bass DLC Capcom shoves at me)", "timestamp_created": 1538622379, "timestamp_updated": 1538688428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.813784897327423096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45093557": {"recommendationid": "45093557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019001636", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1672563810}, "language": "spanish", "review": "De alguna forma capcom logro hacer que megaman 11 se sienta mas como megaman que megaman 9 y 10!\n", "timestamp_created": 1538620751, "timestamp_updated": 1538620751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45093317": {"recommendationid": "45093317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217245159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1551749583}, "language": "spanish", "review": "que se puede decir del MEGAMAN que no se sepa mas que es un JUEGAZO", "timestamp_created": 1538619366, "timestamp_updated": 1538619366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45093044": {"recommendationid": "45093044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031121795", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1538640407}, "language": "english", "review": "cant play it freezes on the loading screen it reminded me of playing on the original nintendo but at least you pull out the game and blow on it here you just look on your screen wondering what can you do to play it fustrating \n", "timestamp_created": 1538617796, "timestamp_updated": 1538617796, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.261706143617630005", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45093008": {"recommendationid": "45093008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034855465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1161, "last_played": 1691643464}, "language": "english", "review": "Double Gear System is the highlight of MM11, and I want to talk about it:\n\nWhat I like about the gear system is that the game does NOT force you to use the system to complete, even in Superhero mode. This means that designers can create levels that are difficult by default, and players can utilize the gear system to make challenges manageable. You can totally tackle any stages first by making good use of the gear system to overcome challenges before you get your first special weapon.\nI do think introducing power gear right at the start might not be a good idea; speed gear tends to do a better job anyway, not to mention when double shot could punish you with it's knockback. Power gear will shine once you obtain special weapons. Personally, I love the power gear over speed gear; in the past games, usually only 1 special weapon out of 8 has a powered up version, and now all 8 weapons can be powered up without charging! With proper usage of power geared special weapons, you will annihilate enemies and environments in no time!\n\nWe will have to see if Double Gear System will only be exclusive to MM11 like Jet Adapter in MM7, but even without it, sliding, charged buster, special weapons, Rush coil/jet, items are at your disposal, so you could totally set your own rules if you wish to play MM11 in classic style.\n\nAfter clearing the game, I can definitely say that Mega Man, being absent for 8 years, has made a triumph return, and more!\nI definitely recommend MM11 to fans of the action-platforming genre.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1538617556, "timestamp_updated": 1538617556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45092784": {"recommendationid": "45092784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040173478", "num_games_owned": 522, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1538615211}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me around 4 hours to complete this really fun Mega Man game with modern controls, probably the easiest too but has some tough areas.

The Dual Gears system was a good introduction, helping beginners enter the series and not bothering veterans looking for more challenges.\n\nThe game could have included more exploration elements, as in its previous games (Mega Man 7 for example), and would be welcome new functions for the Rush and Beat, the dog and bird companions of Megaman respectively, as attack mode and other assists. The soundtrack left a little to be desired, even more that this has always been a strong point in the classic series, not that it sucks, but nothing compared to before.\n\nAnyway, Mega Man is back and I hope he can attract new players and rescue the old ones.

A very forgettable entry, though.\n\nPros: Graphics are generally nice(albeit sometimes distracting to the point where you can't see yourself). Better than Mega Man 8 in that regard. \n\nCons: Seemingly no real use for Rush Jet other than to accidentally summon it. Too much of the gameplay seems like it requires using the gear system rather than just being optional. When they added the powered up buster MM4 it was great cause you did't *have* to use it to complete a stage. It seems like you absolutely have to use the gears for some parts. I don't think the gears really added anything fun to the game.\n\nBiggest con: The forgettable music. I don't know if it's the mixing or the synths they used for it, but most of the stage music sounds exactly the same and just blends into the background. None of it is memorable which is pretty sad for a game series that has many iconic tunes. \n\nOver all: They should have stuck with what made the 8-bit Mega Man great: challenges within a simplistic design.", "timestamp_created": 1538607953, "timestamp_updated": 1538607953, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.363699942827224731", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45091448": {"recommendationid": "45091448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023928362", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 277235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1686210755}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n-Good character development\n-Good atmosphere\nGreat 2.5D Artstyle\n-Animation was perfect\n-Game ran at smooth 60fps\n-Double Gear System greatly affects gameplay mechanic such as Powering up Mega Buster/Special Weapon or Control Flow of Time\n-Gameplay and level design feels classic Mega Man games \n-Game has several difficulty to choose: Newcomer, Casual, Normal, and Superhero\n-Music was excellent\n-Game renders with native DirectX 11 API Renderer to leverage CPU cores and threads\n-Comes with graphics option such as Resolution, V-Sync On/Off, Anti-Aliasing, Fullscreen, Windowed, Windowed (Borderless) Fullscreen Mode\n\nCons:\n-Capcom implemented Denuvo Anti-Tamper DRM which places great concern to consumers who want to keep their legit copy of their game, otherwise Denuvo Company may go out of business\n-Game consumes more than 1.5GB VRAM, so you'll need at least 2GB VRAM to prevent game hitching/stuttering, regardless game resolution.\n-Game may require decent CPU to avoid potential frame rate choppiness\n-Voice Acting was okay in English, though you can switch between English & Japanese. Not to mention, you can also set Voice Volume down to 0, though character voice dialogue may be bothersome to some audience.\n-Game may be hard for the first time, but once you get familiar with stage and boss fight pattern, you can beat the game in no time, especially speedrunners. \n\nVerdict: I was having a blast with Mega Man 11. Game felt very challenging and it was very fun too. Although it's been 8 years to release new Mega Man game since Mega Man 10, it was well worth it to buy &  play as Blue Bomber again and defeat new robot masters, and of course Dr. Wily. But one important question remains here, is it fun and better than Mighty No. 9? The answer is yes!  Input lag was responsive, game feels classic Mega Man, lots of replay value, outstanding character development, good atmosphere, music was good, good plot, and overall very entertaining and enjoyable. All in all, I highly recommend this game if you love 2.5D Side-Scrolling Action Game.With that being said, Capcom did good job delivering best 2.5D Mega Man game in 2018.

These levels aren't designed with classic Mega Man in mind at all the segments reek of this would actually be a fun challenge if I could wall jump or dash like in a certain other sequel spinoff, *COUGH* Mega Man X. The Gear System is less of a solution and more of a small bandage on top of a Gouged out eye ball. Also the levels are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long and has mini bosses, again fine for X since he can cover ground faster than a speeding bullet, but classic Mega Man is more slow paced by design so this really kills the flow and turns into artificial padding.

The gameplay has its moments, but these tiny gems of pleasure are overshadowed by a watered-down Mega Man experience.\n\nThe music is utterly forgettable. This is a capital sin for any Mega Man game. From the game intro to the individual stages, the music is about as generic as you can get.\n\nThe voice acting is a nightmare. I don't play Mega Man for the voice acting or the deep story, but good lord, it is just unpleasant on every level.\n\nThe item system (Dr. Light's Lab) completely changes the Mega Man formula, but not in a positive way. No longer do you need to weigh the risk vs reward of attempting to grab difficult-to-reach E Tanks and 1-Ups. You can just stock up on them in the lab. I'm not even sure why the permanent items, like the anti-ice part, have costs, as they are so inexpensive that you will own them all within the first 30 minutes of gameplay, and they actively diminish the gameplay elements of the game. Why have a \"slippery ice\" mechanic at all when I can just choose not to have to deal with it?\n\nThe boss fights look neat, but the bosses themselves and their abilities are underwhelming and confusing. A staple of Mega Man games is figuring out what weapons will be effective against what bosses. From my experience, no weapon is substantially better against bosses than the plain ol' Mega Buster. Heck, no weapon is better period. The cost of using the weapons is so great and their value so little that you will never really find yourself in a situation where you need to switch from the Mega Buster, except just for the sake of mixing up the jump-and-shoot gameplay.\n\nWhen it comes to the boss fights, they really just boil down to pew-pew-pew-E-Tank-repeat. Since you can stock up on E-Tanks, it's basically impossible to lose a boss fight. If a player wants to challenge themselves then sure, you can choose not to use Dr. Light's lab, but when you have to ignore an entire aspect of the game's design in order to find it enjoyable, then that is bad design.\n\nThe 2-gear system is just an all-around oddity. There is no point in using the power gear except to access your special weapons' secondary fire. But since you'll almost always be using the basic Mega Buster, this never really comes into play, leaving 99% of the gear system being used to slow down the innumerable death walls that pop up in almost every stage. Why use the power gear when I can just slow down time and get in twice as many regular shots?\n\nFinally, there is an issue with the Steam version of the game's audio. At least on my system, I am unable to adjust the game's audio via the volume keys on my keyboard. If my computer falls asleep while I have the game paused, the game will be muted until I completely exit and restart. Due to the terrible voice acting and bland soundtrack, I'm actually not sure if this can be considered a negative...\n\nSo overall, it is with a heavy heart that I rate this game as Not Recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1538602992, "timestamp_updated": 1538760429, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.394695520401000977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45080712": {"recommendationid": "45080712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017426654", "num_games_owned": 700, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1237, "last_played": 1666536659}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot understate the masterpiece this is for a die hard Mega Man 1-3 fan.

That's after 15hours of grinding so I have seen alot of the game already multiple times.\n\nFPS ISSUES\n-For completely unknown reasons(though I suspect it could be Denuvo), FPS drops to 45 from 60\n\nSOUNDTRACK CRITIQUE\n-The soundtrack feels lifeless and very anime.  If you turn on instrumental version, it gets worse.  The instrumental tracks sound like they were pulled from various visual novels.  I am not kidding.  Wily 1-4 all have the exact same track as well.  Even Mega Man 1 had two separate tracks for the Wily Stages.  Why are we going backward?\n\nVOICE ACTING\n-So, Mega Man has grown some balls.  That is nice.  However, the English VA is still pretty bad.  Not Mega Man 8 bad, but it comes close.  The Japanese VA sounds pretty good but again, it now feels like I am playing an anime platformer, not a Mega Man title.\n\nCONTROLS\n-So, it usually feels pretty solid, however, I have two issues: Sometimes my inputs are just eaten(usually a jump input).  I am using a mechanical keyboard that has no issues in other titles.\nThe second issue is global input prevention.  This game DOES NOT allow you to have keystrokes recorded in other applications.  I use WSplit for speedrunning(and yes, global input is turned on).  MM 11 refuses to allow inputs to any other application.  You have to mouse out of the game window.  You also cannot use PrintScreen...\n\nGRAPHICS\n-While the Saturday morning anime/cartoon feel is done very very well, it does not feel like we have progressed.  It could jsut be my \"old\" age, but I would have preferred a 3D art style closer to Mega Man 8(MM11 is very anime already) instead of a age 7-13 anime.  Preference, but doesn't detract from the experience, mostly anyway.\n\nSTORY(spoilers)\n-The plot device(double gear system) is a pretty shallow of a reason to have conflict.  ALso, this game in no way contributes to the overall plot of the entire Mega Man franchise.  It could have been called something completely different or made as a side title.  Bass, Protoman, hell, even the Rush Jetpack is missing.  No mention of the previous viruses.  No mention of Zero and reploids(such as prototype development of X).  Just feels completely out of place in the timeline.  Oh, and Wily actually jsut leaves at the end of the game.  No capture and in jail.  Just up up and away.  Thanks, Mega Man!\n\nOVERALL\n-It is a fun game.  Feels like it should have been priced 14.99 or maybe 19.99.  The boss designs are cool but nor original and all the fights are pretty boring...like, really boring.  All the bosses seem influenced by particular anime archtypes.  Burstman being an obvious doppleganger to Bakuga from Boku no Hero(not kidding at all).  Even some of the sound effects were taken from Boku no Hero(right before Mega Man warps out, you here a little pew pew jingle.  That is the EXACT same sound effect Boku no Hero used for commercial breaks in Season 1 for when the My Hero Academia logo fades in).\n\nIt is a nice game - just not a very Mega Man in audio or visuals if compared to others in the franchise.  Maybe this is the direction Capcom chooses to take from here on out.\n\nFor the record: my current any% speedrun is 57:37.

Effectively the best middleground I could have imagined.\n\nEach world, corridor, and boss is given special detail that tells a story and brings you closer into Mega Man's world more than ever. Let this be a lesson that even budgeted games can be immersive and breathtaking with the right art style to compensate limitations and direction. Just imagine what they can do with a Mega Man X game, or dare I say a new Ghosts 'n Goblins?\n\nRegarding gameplay, weapon switching is a much needed mechanic revitalizing the series, alongside Speed Gear that can actually teach you how to dodge attacks, and Double Gear technique that can save you in a pinch if used correctly (and doesn't feel too overpowered due to the more sophisticated bosses that counteract it) and of course the Gear shop from Mega Man 9 returns. Despite all of this, the game remains challenging (unless you farm for screws and max out E tanks) but never feels unfair. With practice, everything starts to make sense.\n\nThe Gear system might seem overwhelming at first, but you'll get used to it in due time, and interesting enough, you don't NEED the system either. There's no pattern that requires the Speed Gear for instance (except one attack in the final boss battle and Impact Man's giant Power Gear attack, I have no idea how to dodge that) and many of the attacks in this game I learned how to naturally bypass by studying their animations during slowdown, which helped me save Double Gear meter when I needed it.\n\nIt plays wonderfully, looks great, and feels fresh, but some issues that stood out are:\n\n-  The level design is MOSTLY solid. There's a few bizarre corridors in some worlds that feel pointless, if not redundant. Such as a room almost completely repeated except with an extra enemy or two, or a screen in the later half that features one insignificant enemy you need to climb towards. It just feels like padding, and the last boss battle is exceptionally strange in that regard because you're forced to ride a lengthy floating panel towards the location, with enemies attacking you, but it's actually almost impossible to die because of how few enemies exist on screen, and there's no pits or spikes to instakill you. It's a literal ride for no reason, you can just put your controller down and eventually reach the boss unless one of the minions knocks you off the platform and forces you to jump back on. But before reaching the final boss, there's full replenishes for health and energy, so even if you took slight damage, it didn't matter. The whole thing just felt like a waste of time, it could have just been a single room.\n\n- The music in this game is also... Kind of bad, they're opting for EDM-like tunes and most of the OST just comes off unmemorable, and grating at worse (Bounce Man stage)\n\nI haven't tried the instrumental playlist yet, perhaps it'll be better for a replay.", "timestamp_created": 1538592845, "timestamp_updated": 1538593395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578942418098449707", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45078722": {"recommendationid": "45078722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082438220", "num_games_owned": 996, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1690958079}, "language": "english", "review": "Best action platformer of 2018, nothing else this year even comes close to what Capcom delivered with Mega Man 11.

I love how bosses have a visual effect when you hit them with their weakness. And the 2d-3d is very fitting for a MM game, it was great in MMX8 already and is even better here. I like them a lot.\nThe difficulty is to the point of a MM game. There are spots you will hate - and that is a good thing, because you will master them just next time. And then there are items that help you with pesky stuff - anti-spike items for example, or a shock absorber. those are just what you need and bolt farming is easy enough.\n\nI hope for some marvelous DLCs like Forte and Protoman, and some new stages aswell.

The stages are a healthy mix of old and new, featuring several familiar enemies and obstacles as well as some creative new ones, which bring with them some new mechanics never before seen in [i]Mega Man[/i].\n\nThe game's key feature and largest innovation is the Double Gear System, which allows you to temporarily toggle on one of two special modes; Speed Gear slows the world around you, and Power Gear improves your attacks. Overusing the Double Gear will cause Mega Man to overheat, preventing you from using it again until it cools down, which both balances the system and adds a degree of extra tension to gameplay. The system is a perfect fit for [i]Mega Man[/i] and it's hard to imagine not having it in future titles.\n\nThere are about a dozen upgrade chips to unlock and purchase, which augment the rest of your arsenal in minor but appreciable ways, such as reducing the recoil of your High Power shot or allowing you to tweak what kinds of items drop most frequently,\n\nThe game's story is typical of the Classic series, fun and fairly low stakes, though it does delve into the history of Light and Wily, offering us a never before seen glimpse into their past. While it doesn't do a great deal to propel the narrative forward in the overall timeline, and a few fan favorite characters are missing in action, it does feel like it's laying a new foundation for future stories to be built on.\n\nThe art direction is, frankly, phenomenal. While the engine isn't pushing any boundaries, the scenery is gorgeous and resembles the hand-painted backgrounds for [i]Mega Man 8[/i], and the characters have solid models and textures, as well as exceptionally charming animations. And while you may not notice it in the heat of the moment, the attention to detail is extraordinary. The backgrounds are full of unique objects and easter eggs, and the stage enemies are endowed with a great deal of personality thanks to expressive faces and creative death animations.\n\nThe soundtrack most resembles that of [i]Mega Man 8[/i]. It's solid and suits the stages well, and there are a few memorable themes, though it unfortunately doesn't come close to the iconic soundtracks of the earliest titles in the franchise. The English voice acting is a marked improvement over nearly all past entries in the franchise, and is actually quite good, with the Robot Masters having enough dialogue to keep things sounding fresh each time you fight them. Japanese voice options are also available, or you can simply mute the voices entirely if you want a more traditional experience.\n\nOn Normal Mode the game's length and difficulty is about average for a [i]Mega Man[/i] title, with eight Robot Master stages and four levels set in Wily's Castle. Some post-game unlocks allow you to replay any stage in the game with enhanced abilities, and completing the game also unlocks a large number of challenges with online leaderboards, including time trials, a score attack mode, boss rush, and several minigames, to name a few.\n\nThe PC port seems to be solid. It's fairly low spec and runs extremely well. There aren't many video options to toggle (resolution, anti-aliasing, vsync), though it doesn't really seem to need any. It supports xinput controllers (I played using x360ce and a Dual Shock 2) and is [i]almost[/i] fully rebindable.\n\nAll told, it's an excellent return to form for the series after being gone for so many years, and for a budget title you can't ask for much more. Though no DLC has been announced as of yet, there are already some systems in place that would support special events or holidays, and I'm sure fans would love for those missing characters to show back up in playable form in the future.\n\nAs a longtime [i]Mega Man[/i] fan, I really couldn't recommend it more, and sincerly hope that it performs well enough to get more content and/or a [i]Mega Man 12[/i] headed up by the same team.", "timestamp_created": 1538581548, "timestamp_updated": 1538582058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680474162101745605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45075924": {"recommendationid": "45075924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088541148", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 580, "last_played": 1552241192}, "language": "english", "review": "Waited decades for this game, it's worth every cent I paid.", "timestamp_created": 1538581487, "timestamp_updated": 1538581487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45075851": {"recommendationid": "45075851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052796863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1627169875}, "language": "english", "review": "its mega man as you know it with better graphics the music was better like the old mega man ....but still a great game and challenging as usual....good job capcom staying close to the mega man roots.", "timestamp_created": 1538581205, "timestamp_updated": 1538581205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45075738": {"recommendationid": "45075738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050700735", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1540619880}, "language": "english", "review": "No. 11 is mightier than no. 9", "timestamp_created": 1538580754, "timestamp_updated": 1542825567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45075699": {"recommendationid": "45075699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054410153", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1604153218}, "language": "english", "review": "It keeps the original stuff and add a few good ideas!

"language": "english", "review": "This is arguably one of the more difficult Mega Man games.  You'll really need to rely on the double gear mechanic to get through some of the levels as it's nearly impossible to clear a stage without using it.  I just started playing the game but I suppose repeated farming for bolts will be required to get the E-Tanks and upgrades in order to make the game less frustrating to clear.\n\nApart from the new Double Gear System Mega Man 11 stuck to its roots and played things safe by retaining the traditional Mega Man tropes: 8 robot masters that recommends to be beaten in a certain order, weapons to obtain, upgrades and items to purchase, and of course the Dr. Wily castle at the end.  As for the storyline it's pretty straightforward where Dr. Wily is upfront in his schemes instead of manipulating someone.  Judging by the flashback scenes I suppose this game would be one step towards ending the Light-Wily feud, or at least move the plot towards the X series.  Nah.\n\nGraphics are pretty beautiful, using 2.5D cel-shaded graphics but overall this is just your traditional NES Mega Man with beefed up graphics.  The best thing I liked is that the game requires less than 2GB of space to download and it runs well on my GTX 750, making it well-optimized even for a potato PC.\n\nIf there's a gripe I would have on this game that would be the lack of secrets and branching paths.  There are no collectible letters or armor parts to find, so once you clear a level there's pretty mucn no reason to redux it other than getting the Steam achievements.\n\nIf you're a Mega Man fan or a fan of platforming games this is a sure buy.

If you haven't played Mega Man before, or aren't certain if you will enjoy it, the selectable difficulty modes really open up the game to first-timers so you can continuously retry without running out of chances, so don't fret.\n\n[h1](Length)[/h1]\nThe stages are heavily based on the NES styled titles, with large rooms and unique gimmicks. There are 8 Main Stages, 2 Wily Stages, a simple Boss Capsule Refight Stage, and a short ride to the Final Battle. There is no intro stage in this game, which is a minor disappointment. The total amount of content is brisk, so if you know what you are doing, expect to complete the game in a few hours, tops.\n\nThe extra modes pad out the content a little, but the entire point of this game is to challenge yourself. You can get a lot of replay value out of trying to play the game without using special weapons or the gear system, essentially replaying the same content with restrictions to unlock achievements or self improvement.\n\n[h1](Balance)[/h1]\nThere are only two areas I can recall where you get trapped into taking a hit, one in Blastman's stage, and one in Impact Man's. Unless you have foresight, you will likely take a hit there. Thankfully, there is no such forced hit involving instant death. All falling blocks and spikes are clearly telegraphed, and any player skillful enough can feasibly avoid such obstacles without unfair deaths.\n\nE-Tank Spam trivializes a lot of the difficulty on all modes, but especially the easier ones, due to the sheer amount of bolts that drop. E-Tanks only cost 100 bolts a pop, and you can walk out of a stage with 1000+ if you pick up every drop. You simply never run out of these things, which means most of the game can be beaten by standing on top of bosses and tanking the damage while you burn the bosses down, chugging E-Tanks every so often. This is only a problem if you choose to use this form of recovery, though.\n\nEverything felt great playing Buster Only, so if you are interested in a playthrough without powers or special weapons, look forward to an excellent challenge.\n\n[h1](Weapons)[/h1]\nThe special weapons in this game are easily among the most powerful in a long line of games. They have very generous hitboxes and have enormous utility, making almost all of them a pure upgrade over your default buster. Power Gear toggling just to wipe the screen with overwhelming special weapons feels extremely nice.\n\nIn addition, there is a new option to change your special weapons with the right control stick. It has never been easier to utilize these things.\n\n\n[h1](Soundtrack)[/h1]\nAlthough music is a very subjective thing, I have to say that I found the vast majority of the soundtrack to be utterly forgettable. This is very much a soundtrack made for a newer age, and felt much more modernized than ever before. You won't find the same level of catchy melodies as any of the past Mega Man titles. None of the music is outright bad, but it pains you much moreso when the series is known for such well made music and you end the experience without any of the tunes stuck in your head.\n\n\n[h1](Final Notes)[/h1]\nThe game is short and sweet. There are really just 10 meaty stages with a few extra short walks to the final bosses. You will get your money's worth if you decide to try the higher difficulties or want to play the side modes, but they are more of the same. If you enjoy challenging yourself, grab this for sure. If you are more of a \"variety\" gamer and will only play this once, you might only get 3-5 hours out of it, so do keep that in mind.\n\nIf you want to see this series prosper, you really owe it to yourself to support the Blue Bomber so that his games may continue. The sales are essentially votes, so vote with your wallet! \n\n[b]Welcome back, buddy.

I'm going to post what i saw.\n\nWhat i enjoy is the Story, just because it seems soo cheese but something about that seem to fit to me. The models aren't bad either. now to what i didn't like\n\n1. To me the animations are just bad. Walking is strange and MM doesn't even seem to interacte with the ground'. What i mean he seem more like he's flouting then running. Then in a modern't game he doesn't make any sounds when he walks which just adds to my point. Yes in the older game he didn't make sounds but they did in the PS2 games. \n2. The levels kinda suck. I played almost all the games before mega man 9 but for the 4 levles i played all had a active mini boss. This part wasn't what i had a problem with. What i had the problem was with the check point system. All of these levels have no check points before these battles so if you die you will have to go back to the beginning.", "timestamp_created": 1538546453, "timestamp_updated": 1538546453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45068470": {"recommendationid": "45068470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120315138", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1604983560}, "language": "english", "review": "This is what Mighty No.9 should have been.\nI've only beaten 2 of the 8 robot masters so far, and I've loved every minute of it.", "timestamp_created": 1538545925, "timestamp_updated": 1538545925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544072985649108887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45068386": {"recommendationid": "45068386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235407144", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1629119651}, "language": "english", "review": "This takes me back to a place where the games are great, challenging, had great music, and excellent controls.

Also, when finish climbing stair, it takes a bit longer than before to climb up. It's a little annoying. You can use the right analog to change weapons quickly and that is a BIG plus. The double gear system is fun but Speed Gear (kinda of like Slow Down in Viewtiful Joe) is WAY TOO GOOD. It makes the game easy. I also like the new weapons. They are mostly fun to use and some of the less useful weapons are pretty strong during Power Gear. The levels are longer than previous games. They are mostly well designed, but I am not a fan of the Torch Man stage and Bounce Man stage. All in all, I think MM11 is a good game, but not great. I feel the game is a bit short and the music is really average. Hope Capcom is willing to take more risk making the next game and bring back Proto Man and Bass!", "timestamp_created": 1538544007, "timestamp_updated": 1538884588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45068057": {"recommendationid": "45068057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378341465", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1538, "last_played": 1592411456}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes Yes Yes Yes\nBuy this game", "timestamp_created": 1538543335, "timestamp_updated": 1538543335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45068041": {"recommendationid": "45068041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071565116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1620960330}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Simplemente FANTASTICO.
