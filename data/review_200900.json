The gameplay is really engaging, and the story is awesome. It's a standard challenge progression until the end if you're going for the best ending. I wouldn't have known how to get the best ending without walkthroughs because the steps to get the ending would take a few run-throughs of the game to figure out on my own. The last part of getting the best ending entails the game going balls to the wall hard with one of the difficult segments of a platformer I've played in awhile. I was so happy when I finally beat it and got the best possible conclusion to the story. The music was fantastic, too. I played with the original graphics and music, mind you, but the new graphics and music aren't bad.

Should you disagree, download the freeware verson)\n\nCave Story is an indie classic and for good reason. It's not about its impressive graphics or insanely outlandish gameplay. It's the grandfather of indie games for having a good idea, executing it very well and being developed by a small studio (in this case, one guy). Cave Story is a 2D platformer run'n'gun with a very neat story, soundtrack, gameplay, ambience and overall feel. It's just a game that feels good to play. Everything about its main game is charming and I can't recommend it enough.\n\nI only have one small issue with the game with the game (mild spoilers ahead): \n[spoiler] The entirety of the good ending route. [/spoiler] \n\n\n[spoiler] Everything from the game's normal and bad ending are super cohesive. Gameplay is balanced, story is well paced and well laid out in your path. Nothing feels out of place. But the good ending requirements ask you to do some asenine weird logic for its completion, it undermines the well written main villain with a bigger out of nowhere bad guy and the balancing of the last act is hellish. The neutral ending was super memorable, emotional and narratively relevant, but the good ending, while it's nice the idea of having a happy ending, comes at the cost of narrative coherence and frustrating gameplay. [/spoiler] \n\nEven with the previous issue about it, I can easily say it's one of the best games I have played and I don't regret playing it at all.

The diversity of weapons is also neat as it allows for multiple playstyles according to the player, and it rewards skillful playing by letting you upgrade your weapons and keep them powered up. And sure, some of the bosses and what not could have been better/more balanced, including the final spoiler boss which has no saves on your way to him. But honestly, most of what I'd say about how I play or what I struggle with is all in my honest opinion.\n\nEdit: After getting the true ending with Curly, I can safely say that I've improved quite a lot as I first tried the spoiler boss at the end.

Probably 1/4 of the time playing the game was spent on the last 'road to the best ending' segment, which made me a bit angrier and my opinion a bit lower\n\nJumped into this game mostly blindly. Kind of a weird one, featuring many flaws of the past era games. \nMinuses:\n- Bad placement of savepoints - repeating progress could feel painful\n- Random difficulty spikes\n- Unskippable dialogue\\cutscenes (annoying at bosses and probs at game reruns)\n- Traversing long locations in different directions was not  fun.\n- Losing weapon EXP when taking damage is a horrible mechanic, imo.\n- Story that starts in a \"Random bullsh*t go!\" style and is only getting explained much later on\n- Story in general lacks depth. Its not too bad, but is told kinda fast... slow moments and 'juicy details' would be appreciated\n- Best ending and some characters lives being decided by a very unpredictable and stupid player choice in the mid-game (almost impossible to make unknowingly)\n- Best ending is additionally locked by an extremely hard sequence of levels near the end. And then its story ends up being not that special or satisfying >.<\n\nPluses:\n+ Interesting\\charming, at times.\n+ Dynamic platforming gameplay (haven't expected it)\n+ Difficulty is satisfying, at times. (delete Bloodstained sanctuary pls)\n+ A bunch of weapons and all are useful in some way, wow\n+ While many music tracks were kind of \"ok but forgettable\", some were really cool (Labyrinth Fight, Meltdown 2, Scorching Back, Moonsong, Pressure)\n\nOverall... I probably got forked into this one from Undertale recommendations. They are somewhat similar in terms of story, both being fantasy tales. Imo - Undertale overrides this game in almost all aspects, specifically so at story and characters, all of which were much deeper. But, in terms of gameplay, Undertale fights also felt more memorable. Mhm. Anyway, Cave story is a nice platformer, and, given its date of creation (2004), its pretty damn great.

You will Probably Die many times, at least for your first run, Or if you go for the best ending, then...Good luck...\n\nI love this game and everything about it...well I'd say that if It weren't for Nicalis.\n\nThey Cheated Pixel of his well deserved, Hard earned money. Keep in mind, Pixel had been working on the OG game, for 5 YEARS. and then He released it for FREE. \n\nSo, I'd say...Go buy Kero Blaster, Along with this game. Even if you don't play Kero Blaster, You'lle be paying the guy who really made this game. I also say, Don't buy more than one copy unless you have to. (Or in my situation, someone else bought the Switch version on the main one, so I can't download it on my Switch Lite.) \n\nIf you Buy a copy, Buy the Switch. Even though it's 15 Dollars more, You're getting:\n\n- The Jukebox, Right out the Bat\n- 2 Player (They should have Done this a Long time ago) [Not online only Local (WHY NICALIS WHY)]\n- Every Version of the soundtrack (+ Two Extras)\n- Animated Talksprites and Cleaner Water (Remastered Graphics Only)\n- And Dynamic Lighting.\n\nIf you can't buy the Switch version though, Definitely buy this. Like seriously, You'll miss out on the best indie game.

The decisions to be made, and the constant arsenal of weapons allowing no play-through to be truly the same. All, with music written by the brilliant Amaya-San.

The art style is cute and adorable. The soundtrack is an 8/10, personally every OST, whether it's the original, remastered or PC version, has great remixes.

Does this game hold up? Yes. Is it worth buying Cave Story+ instead of just playing the original freeware version?... Well, read on for a more in-depth review of this particular version (port?) of Cave story.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\nStudio Pixel\u2019s art style is very endearing, and honestly just strikes my personal preferences in the right way; it\u2019s both cute and abstract, it leaves room for interpretation and imagination while being immediately clear what everything is at the same time. Unlike so many other indie games that merely try to copy the style of other games, Studio Pixel manages to cut his own style in the medium that is both appealing and immediately identifiable as his work.\nBeyond just the quality of his pixel art, Studio Pixel is a pretty great artist/character designer in a general sense.\n\nOf course one of the things Cave Story is most famous for is its music; it\u2019s great. There is very little to say besides that.\n\n[b]Cave Story +[/b]\nCave story+\u2019s visuals are updated, all the sprites and art have been redrawn to 16-bit. The music too has both, been remastered AND remade for this release.\n\nDon\u2019t like Cave Story+\u2019s Art or Music, and prefer the original\u2019s? Just go into the options and change them back. It respects the original\u2019s presentation while offering a different look.\n\n[h1]Writing[/h1]\nOne of the things I adore about Studio Pixel\u2019s work is his mix of Mature & Immature; The whimsical Fairytale Adventure like Plot, with Cutesy characters (the Immature); with the dark background elements and Death scenes of said Cutesy characters (the Mature). In fact there are some surprisingly \u201cAdult\u201d things in this game that give the characters so much more\u2026 character, such as picking up a female character\u2019s underwear as an item, or finding another character\u2019s lipstick in your inventory. It\u2019s suggestive, but in a way that goes over a child\u2019s head.\n\nAnyway, Cave Story is a story of a young mute boy who wakes up in a cave with no memories, thus begins his \u201cCave Story\u201d if you will\u2026 Along the way you\u2019ll meet a village of rabbit people who are under siege by a powerful being called \u201cThe Doctor\u201d and his lackeys. The game does a great job of revealing its plot and answering its mysteries piece by piece. \n\nThe world building is great too, with great little background details that say a lot for example: [spoiler]The hero Arthur, the strongest of the rabbit people, inside his house we see the red flowers in the basement, the red flowers being a source of rage inducing power for the rabbit people; the implication is that Arthur used the red flowers to gain his strength but retained control of himself. This is never outright stated, nor even touched upon.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Cave Story+[/b]\nNothing really changed here, HOWEVER, the translations are different from the original translations.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nHonestly the gameplay is the area that has aged the most poorly, in that Cavestory once had a fairly unique gameplay style that has now become somewhat bog standard for indie games; however it was still Cavestory that set that standard.\n\nWith that said, Cavestory still feels quite great to play, with very simple controls, large weighty jumps, and a simple combat loop. \n\n[b]Cave Story +[/b]\nCave Story+ is essentially the same, though it does offer some neat extra challenge modes, as well as a \u201cCurly Mode\u201d, and a piece of cut content called \u201cThe Wind Fortress\u201d.\nThere is also a Hard Mode for the masochistic, and an Easy Mode for babies.\n\n[h1]Criticisms[/h1]\n[b]Presentation[/b]\n\nWhile I have no criticisms for the Original\u2019s presentation, I do have some thought on +\u2019s:\n[list]\n[*]The remade Art for the most part looks nice, but giving Quote a mouth, or any other character for that matter, was foolish. The Original\u2019s art allowed for interpretation as to how the character may feel during any given scene, but +\u2019s art makes it look like Quote is smiling at all times, even during the more harrowing scenes. It\u2019s really kills the mood\n[*]What\u2019s the point of allowing us to change our preferred art style back to the original, if you\u2019re not going to allow it for the Extra Modes?\n[*]Some of the character art changes are just bad\n[/list]\n\n[b]Writing[/b]\n\nOne criticism I can give to the original work is that it SCREAMS for a sequel. Ordinarily leaving the audience wanting more is a good thing, and there is no lingering plot thread that needed to be answered within this game, and yet there is something about it that leaves you unfulfilled (despite being so good).\n\nThere\u2019s also just this certain feeling of elements being underutilised, for example; was there any need or reason for Toroko to be The Hero Arthur\u2019s little sister? But this is likely nitpicking an Indie game made as a hobby.\n\nAs +\u2019s handling of the writing\u2026 As I hinted at earlier, I\u2019m not impressed by their translations, unless I\u2019m misremembering, it appears they made certain plot reveals far more obvious and took some strong liberties with the dialogue. Nothing seemingly too egregious, but it is frustrating when everyone is saying \u201cHey aren\u2019t you that [spoiler]solider[/spoiler]\u2026 never mind\u201d, only for them to reveal later that you were part of the [spoiler]war[/spoiler]\u2026 Hardly a plot twist at that point. It also feels more juvenile, though maybe that\u2019s just a personal preference thing.\n\nAlso, the writing for \u201cCurly Mode\u201d, or rather her dialogue, comes across as extraordinarily superfluous. Essentially just pointing out the obvious or repeating what others had said, to the point of being obnoxious and annoying rather than as a fun extra mode.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nHonestly, there\u2019s not too much to criticise here:\n[list]\n[*] Some bosses feel like you have to tank your way through to some extent, this is particularly exacerbated by the weighty jumps that can make it hard to dodge are weave through projectiles\n[*] The backtracking (particularly in Sandzone and Grasslands) is a bit much \n[/list]\n\nAs for Cave Story+:\n[list]\n[*]All the challenges are focused around time-trials rather than being gameplay challenges. This is good if you like speedrunning, but that\u2019s a niche and would be boring for most.\n[*]While the addition of a hardmode is great, some bosses almost HAVE to be tanked, and hardmode is solely about ensuring you can\u2019t pick up health upgrades, so this makes some bosses go from slightly-challenging normally to nigh-impossible.\n[*]I like collecting the achievements for games I love, but half of the achievements for this game are behind not just the time trials, but differing speeds of the time trials, from C tier to S tier. This is a game I\u2019d heavily dissuade anyone from trying to get all the achievements for.\n[*]Remember the secret underwear or lipstick I mentioned earlier? Those give achievements now, and make me roll my eyes. Some things should not have achievements.\n[*] This game is almost abandon ware. Nicalis are not updating it. The game will crash every time you beat the challenge modes.\n[*]As a paid product, the extra modes aren\u2019t enough to boost the rather paltry play time, which will be around 2-4 hours, depending on your play speed.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is one of the most beloved indie games of all time for a reason, there\u2019s a personal feeling to it \u2013 it\u2019s something no one else but Studio Pixel (a single man) could have made; it oozes personality. Even now it still feels unique and fresh, despite the imitators.\n\nHowever, Nicalis\u2019 Cave Story+ feels a little half-hearted, like they saw some easy money by re-releasing a beloved property and have now forgotten about it. Get it on special.\n\nOtherwise, I highly recommend everyone play the freeware version at least. It\u2019s a piece of gaming history at the very least.\n", "timestamp_created": 1674903395, "timestamp_updated": 1674903606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131513461": {"recommendationid": "131513461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158453533", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3848, "last_played": 1692954096}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun and challanging game that I would recoment anyone to play.", "timestamp_created": 1674637437, "timestamp_updated": 1674637437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131451010": {"recommendationid": "131451010", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999862235", "num_games_owned": 1510, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 494, "last_played": 1674549086}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember my days of playing this back in 2004, the golden age of video games in my life.

It has aged incredibly well considering this release came out over ten years prior to this review and the original over half a decade before that.\n\nIt has a simple yet compelling story with a pretty good remastered soundtrack and neat 2D sprite designs. The game also features the original soundtrack and graphics as options in the settings although I didn't give those a try.\n\nIt has a unique weapons system that I cannot immediately think of any other games which share it. Basically, you level up weapons from enemy XP drops (identical to item drops) and taking damage brings down weapon XP (potentially reducing your weapon to the previous level if you lose enough). I found it to be a very interesting system, and I would love to see new iterations of it in modern games (maybe there are and I just am not aware of or recalling them).\n\nI played on normal difficulty despite the game encouraging easy difficulty on the first playthrough for whatever reason. I did not have much trouble going through the main game up until the end (I don't think I died more than 2-3 times in any given area or boss fight before the last cave that precedes the various final bosses). That said, the final gauntlets provide a good challenge while feeling fair. Well mostly (looking at you RNG falling blocks room in the bloodstained sanctuary)... You have to go through 3-4 bosses and/or platforming sections without any saves in between. They feel daunting but are very doable once you learn the platform and boss patterns.\n\nThere is unfortunately no option to skip dialogue entirely that I could find (which you really want to do when you are re-running a section multiple times like the endgame areas). However, you can at least fast forward previously played dialogue in that session by spamming the attack button.\n\nThere are a LOT of missables, including the best weapons and best ending requirements... I luckily looked through an achievement guide before locking myself out of the best ending and ultimate weapon. And even then there were some things I missed earlier in the game because I had not looked at a guide yet.\n\nOverall, I can definitely see why it has a reputation as a classic indie game, and I am glad to have finally experienced it!", "timestamp_created": 1664184338, "timestamp_updated": 1664184768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122833155": {"recommendationid": "122833155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302498481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1682625133}, "language": "english", "review": "Pleasant graphics, nice soundtrack, fun gameplay, creative bosses, all around great game.\n\nBut why so CRYPTIC?!

The game also has a serious habit of making seemingly harmless decisions permanently punish you, for example a character will ask you \"Let me look at X items\" and if you say yes, you just lost two of your five weapons permanently, or if you don't do a specific chain of secrets before some random boss a major character dies, or if you try to SAVE YOUR FRIEND he dies and you don't get a jetpack, but if you decide not to (there's no hint at all for you to not save him) he LIVES and you get a cool jetpack, what the hell.\n\nAll in all, cool game, but impossible to enjoy to the fullest in a blind playthrough because of the game actively punishing you for not having precognition.", "timestamp_created": 1664137712, "timestamp_updated": 1681081241, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550579071044921875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122398788": {"recommendationid": "122398788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055039481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 276, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1663450324}, "language": "english", "review": "THE indie metroidvania you know what it is. i honestly expected more but it was pretty fun all in all", "timestamp_created": 1663450991, "timestamp_updated": 1663450991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122381292": {"recommendationid": "122381292", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014283011", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 131, "playtime_at_review": 1417, "last_played": 1700754496}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, worth the 15 bucks.

This game deserves a lot of props for helping to ignite the retro indie game craze, but as one of the pioneers it does have some dated aspects as well.\n\nAs a whole, the game's presentation is really nice, with charming graphics and a memorable soundtrack. The combat is also pretty unique, having you wield weapons that you power up with shards, but that go down in level when you take damage. It rewards good game play and helps heighten the tension. Cave Story pays clear homage to Metroid in various aspects, but also brings its own unique personality.\n\nWhere the game takes a bit of a hit is how obtuse getting the true ending is. In this version of the game, the steps you have to take to successfully access the secret final area and the game's hidden bosses are so counterintuitive that you probably won't be able to figure it out without checking a walkthrough. Also, this version of the game has some lingering bugs, like the fact that it crashes any time you go through one of the optional challenge modes.\n\nThe frustrating thing is that a further improved version of this game came out on the Switch a couple years back that has improved graphics, the ability to play with a second person, and an extra challenge mode. And yet for whatever reason, those improvements have not been added into this version. That lack of developer support combined with the game's aforementioned unclear path to the full ending does make this game a bit frustrating now in hindsight. However, I still enjoy it enough to overlook those aspects and recommend it, especially for fans of indie games.\n\nCave Story is a fun time that also has a really challenging end game if you decide to go for its secret path. It's also a short enough game to replay multiple times and try out different weapons.

Admittedly the gameplay is pretty good early on, when you're exploring and finding upgrades, but the clunky and slippery platforming was noticeable right from the very beginning, and doesn't improve much even after a double jump upgrade.\nThe story was building up to something interesting but dropped the ball. I no longer cared about the story after a certain boss fight and what investment I had in this story and possibly interesting setting was now spent.\nI kept going because I had put the effort in up to that point, but the lack of save points towards the latter parts of the game is ridiculous. I gave up when the final boss was in fact a boss rush with no saving. The game's upgrade system constantly punishes you by making your weapons ineffective mid combat if you get hit, which you will considering the clunky movement I already mentioned.\nMaybe if this was free or back in 2005 when it was first released it was a good game. I could forgive the clunky movement and the lack of save points to a degree. But that doesn't excuse the story dropping the ball, nor forcing a boss rush at the end.\nOnly buy this game if you like difficult platformers, and even then when it's on sale.

This is the OG non-linear indie sidescroller. You may think it was Super Meat Boy or Spelunky or whatever else that proved a beloved cult classic can still be made by one person in a post-Y2K world, but it was actually Cave Story, way back in 2004. I won't even bother reviewing the game as a whole, because if you're here, then chances are you already know or at least heard how good (and hard) it is. Let's just focus on the things that justify the \"+\" in the title.\n\nUpgraded graphics are definitely the biggest improvement. They shift the game from an 8-bit aesthetic to a 16-bit aesthetic, and with the amount of colors and background layers the upgrade actually makes more sense. The details added by 2x upscaled pixel art are probably a bit controversial (like giving Balrog an anime blush, changing the Doctor's dialogue expression, or completely reworking Toroko's portrait), but overall, they're really good and focus on what's cool about the characters and the world of Cave Story. There's an option to revert to the original graphics, which is cool, but not once did I feel like it.\n\nAudio is... fifty-fifty. There's 3 soundtrack options: original, new and remastered. The \"new\" soundtrack sucks. It's still remixed from the original songs, but completely misses the feel of the songs and it makes the game feel like a throwaway Google Play Store download. Remastered soundtrack is decent, pretty cool sometimes, but it also loses the impact of the original in other moments. OG OST is still the best one and is filled to the brim with bangers. Final boss theme remains one of the best final boss themes in gaming, period.\n\nAnother point of controversy is the new translation. I have to say, most of the time it felt better to me. More professional, avoids typical problems with JP-EN translation and just feels natural all around. However, sometimes there's these small bits that just sounded way cooler in the old translation, like \"heavens, that felt good\" or \"until the day you die, you WILL be my puppet\". Also, two fun easter eggs were completely removed in the translation for unknown reasons. Sadly, there's no option to switch to the old translation.\n\nThe last new thing are challenges and achievements - more or less the same thing. If you think the base game is hard (counting the best ending of course), then wait 'til you try them. The machine gun challenge is the easiest of the bunch and it's no wonder there's no achievements tied to it, but the rest is crazy. Wind Fortress, the holy grail of Cave Story cut content finally makes an official appearance, and while it hasn't been tied into the story & game map in any way, it doesn't change the fact that it'll really test your skill with Booster 2.0, Spur, Blade, and mercy invincibility abuse. Getting an S rank is insane, as are all of them actually (though I did it, so you can too!) Did you play the original version? Do you remember the title screen change bonus? Now it's an achievement, too! And you can play just the Sacred Grounds straight from the challenges menu, though you get no rockets there! But you'll find that rockets don't really matter that much this far into the game!! And once you've done all these challenges, be prepared for the beast that is hard mode and beating the entire the game without ANY health upgrades, essentially making it a no-hit run past the third boss or so. Yep, it's clear that a lot of what Cave Story+ offers is aimed at the hardened veterans who know this game like the back of their hand. I know I beat the good ending way back when it was still fresh and learning how to get it was something like an urban legend at the time, and I still needed to pump over 36 hours into this version just so I could hone my skill to perfection to obtain the sweet 100% completion. It's hard as steel but the game is so well done, it's never unfair - every mistake is on you alone.\n\nWhether you've been a fan of Cave Story for 18 years or are learning about it just now, this remaster is worth getting. However, given the controversy surrounding Nicalis, I'd recommend getting it on a big sale, maybe even getting it in a less-than-legal way.

The game has a simple, but fun story and characters, which I loved. I enjoyed the majority of my time with it, but every once in a while, the game would throw something at you that felt a little unfair or cheap. I'm fine with hard games, but they should feel fair, and this game doesn't feel fair at times. For example, reducing all of your weapons to their weakest state right as you go into the final area is so incredibly unfair and mean-spirited, and is ultimately what made me quit after countless deaths in that area. I did managed to beat the game by not picking up the booster, as that results in the platforming for the final area being made less brutal, which I did appreciate (I even kept the Mimiga mask on, lol). The booster's controls in general aren't the most responsive, which I could have lived with, as normally it's pretty fun to use, if the final area's platforming didn't have so little room for error. It's a good game, but its has a lot of cracks. Sometimes I can't help but feel like its age is showing, since some of its game design is pretty archaic. This game feels like a NES game, for better and for worse.

There is a point where you need to fight four bosses without a single save point where all the previous levels had reasonable save locations as levels went on. Each boss has a different pattern, so you could be doing great with the 1st and 2nd boss but you need to keep doing them over and over again just so you can get to the final boss to learn his pattern. This is deliberate gameplay padding: Not fun and and goes against the rhythm set by the game until this point. I'd change the difficulty to 'easy' (you take 50% less damage), but that's not possible and you need to start the game from scratch - something I'd rather not do considering how much backtracking this game has.\n\nIt's a shame since the game looks nice, has nice music (I like the one where you are climbing the tower outside upwards), and fun weapon play. I also don't like is how floaty the character feels which takes me out of the game sometimes since I need to be super careful that my inertia doesn't make me fly off an edge after I land.

Couple this with a greatly immersive narrative, with great and memorable characters and you've got yourself one of my favourite games ever made.

Here was what I wrote to explain why:\n\n\n\nCave Story is another game I'd heard about for a long time before I played it, but I didn't know very much about it...other than one important thing.  With the boom in indie gaming in the 10s - and this isn't close to the last indie game on the list, so I certainly got in on that boom - people called Cave Story \"the grandfather of indie gaming,\" a simple but great game made by one person.  I also heard its gameplay described as \"sort of a mix of Metroid and Contra,\" and that sounded good to me, so at some point earlier in the decade I finally picked up Cave Story+ and went to find out why everyone was still talking about Cave Story, let alone why they were talking about how great it was.\n\nIt started out fun: Good platforming and shooting, catchy music, colorful and pretty graphics, and a lot of cute critters (plus one cute gynoid*).  Then, early on, I got stumped in one area and I was too stubborn (or stupid) to look up what I was supposed to do.  I abandoned it for years.\n\nThen, feeling emboldened by overcoming another personal gaming challenge, I picked it up again and swallowed enough of my pride to look up a guide.  I'm glad I did because once I got past that part, everything good about the game kept getting better, and even when I failed, I was having a blast.  It says a lot about the quality of a game when, even if it's giving you a beating, you're still loving it.  Getting the best ending...that was an accomplishment.\n\nI recommend this for anyone who wants to play a milestone in indie gaming and in gaming period.  But also, don't feel ashamed to look up a guide here and there; some of the things in this game are hard to find, especially when it comes to getting the best ending.\n\n* That's as in, an android that appears female.

This is not a good game, and the drawbacks are present so early I don't fully understand how it became such a beloved classic except that it is/was free.\n\nFirstly, little in this game feels rewarding. The concept of gaining little exp triangles to level up your guns like a shoot-'em-up is kind of interesting, as is losing said exp. on taking damage. However, with your minuscule health bar and the amount of damage enemies do, you're more likely to die and restart with full exp than have to scramble to make up the loss. Enemies are dropping SCADS of these little things, so it's trivial to go to max level with your weapons a quarter of the way into your travels to the next destination. Very early on you get an alternate weapon; a missile. It has limited ammo instead of a level system and feels like a slower, less-accurate version of the max level pistol. Why would I bother using this weapon? It doesn't seem to be better at killing certain enemies. I could conceive of losing all my gun levels and switching to the missile temporarily to farm exp, but I never actually lose my gun levels so what's the point?\n\nSecondly, the \"difficulty\" is largely overinflated by the drunken camera sway. It's like calling Super Mario a precision platformer because you only play it while your friend is sitting next to you shaking your entire body. In more tense portions I would lose projectile-shooting enemies off-screen because what should be my typical screen real estate had suddenly shifted wobbily off-center. I would not mind the many enemies that can one-hit kill me if the screen would stay focused on my character.\n\nThe third and fourth issues are smaller gripes, but it's annoying to have to talk to every rabbit in rabbitville multiple times until I find the right rabbit to tell me I'm allowed to advance the plot when the game already bothered to give me the tools to intuit what to do next. I also had a harder time than expected discerning background objects from foreground platforms. At a glance I would not think this to be a problem, because the background objects are usually darker. I think perhaps there were some darker patches of earth that were foreground platforms in the rabbit village that messed with my ability to discern, but to find out for sure I'd have to turn the game back on and that's not happening.\n\nThis game had been described to me as Mega Man meets Kirby's Great Cave Offensive, and it is violently neither of those things.

I do agree that Nicalis has done (and is doing) scummy and questionable things, but claiming that they \"scammed Pixel out of his money\" or \"scammed him into giving away all rights to the game\" is just so dumb.\n\nI want to make it very clear that Pixel DOES still earn from every single copy of this game. Every single time you purchase this game on Steam, Pixel gets revenue from it. And for those who doubt it, here's a tweet from Pixel himself, claiming that he still earns from Nicalis sales: https://twitter.com/oxizn/status/394822911824896000 (the tweet he replied to is gone now, so you'll have to take my word for it).\n\nSo no, don't pirate the game.

Likable characters, fun to control and play, the weapon variety is pretty nice (though by the end of the game you'll mostly only be using one or two of them) and there's plenty to collect. My biggest gripe is the rather questionable game design at certain points. Instant death spikes are used sparingly, though part of me wish they weren't used at all [spoiler] (with an exception at the Blood-Stained Sanctuary, since there they're essential for the platforming of the first part) [/spoiler]. I'm also a pretty big fan of the trading mechanic, with you being able to [spoiler] save the Polar Star instead of trading it right away for the Machine Gun in favor of the stronger Snake or Spur. [/spoiler] The final dungeon of the game, [spoiler] the Blood-Stained Sanctuary [/spoiler], is only available if you're aiming for the Best Ending and is also a pretty big difficulty spike. Took me about 2 hours straight of blindly playing through it to beat it, including the final boss. It was, however, very satisfying to finally beat.\n\nOverall, I'd probably give the game a solid 9/10. Generally speaking it's a very well made and charming game that set the scene for indies and will forever be in the \"Mt. Rushmore\" of indie games, together with Yume Nikki and the like.

It's historical significance can't be denied.

I can't really put my finger on why this is. I don't necessarily mind the old style graphics and music. I found the movement to be a bit awkward, although I would say the same about many older console games that I grew up on. So I can't fully explain it.\n\nThose interested in replay-ability and challenge have plenty to like. The \"best\" ending is a grueling challenge. I wish there was a way to pursue both the \"best\" and \"good\" endings on a single run - without spoiling anything, I got to a place where I saved and didn't realize there was no turning back until it was too late. Since I wasn't enraptured by the game, I don't have the motivation to replay it to get the different achievements, endings, weapons, etc.\n\nThat said, I would recommend the game.

Along the way, you can do everything from harvest jellyfish juice, find a bunch of dogs, and even talk to (and fight) a sentient mushroom. No other game I know of can make those promises. The game has three endings and piles of secrets that keep you coming back for more. But that's just regular Cave Story.

Cave Story has a phenomenal soundtrack with a track for every situation. A calm theme for a hub area? Mimiga Village has it. An intense boss battle theme? Look no further than Eyes of Flame.\n\nThe option for remastered or classic style in terms of both graphics and soundtrack is excellent; and the fact that they are separate is even better! Wanna play with new visuals but the classic retro OST? You can do that.\n\nAs for the remastered graphics, they provide a fresh new look for the game while still keeping to the original\u2019s charm. Also as stated previously, you can switch back to the old visuals if desired.\n\nOverall, Cave Story+ is a great take on a classic platformer that is still going strong and hopefully does for years to come.", "timestamp_created": 1632351981, "timestamp_updated": 1632351981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99735680": {"recommendationid": "99735680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131916026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1672429159}, "language": "english", "review": "A Beautiful piece of art", "timestamp_created": 1632231378, "timestamp_updated": 1632231378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99684519": {"recommendationid": "99684519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029124312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1632148407}, "language": "english", "review": "The steam download for this game does not work.

Much of it might be seen as outdated by today's standards. It has little puzzle solving and a few interesting combat mechanics and platforming speedrunners might focus on. And quite a few guide-dang-it moments if you're trying to accomplish a particular goal on a given playthrough.\n\nNone of these reasons are the reason you might fall in love with Cave Story. And I can't really tell you any details about why you'd fall in love with Cave Story. It is a game with a world that feels truly alive and deep, at least to me. It is imaginative, and while it has few really fleshed out characters, they're all fairly well written.\n\nIt is important to note that other than some extras and improved graphics, Cave Story+ doesn't offer all that much more than the default Cave Story, which is free. So if you're still on the fence, and you're not sure if you'd like this game, I invite you to Google it, and try out the free version. If, by the end of the Egg Chamber, you're certain that you don't really like it, then ah well. But if you do like the original game, you'll probably like Cave Story+.

It was then released free of charge online in Japanese. eventually English speaking audiences noticed how well designed cave story was, considering everything from the engine, sound, story and graphics were made by one person, this eventually resulted in a relatively well known fan translation group that often translates Japanese-only titles Aeon Genesis to fully translate the game into English, which was followed by many translations for different languages, allowing everyone to experience the game fully. A tribute site was made for discussion and even modding and boom, instant cult classic and the stepping stone for good non triple A games was created.\n\nCave story plays out in a blend of metroidvania and run and gun type attributes, while exploring the mysterious island our mute protagonist has found himself in you'll find many secrets, such as new and unique weapons, capsules that increase your total health, upgrades to existing weapons, funny yet useless items and even 3 different endings. Your weapons (for the most part) are based off a level system, when you kill an enemy they may drop shards that when picked up; get enough of these and your weapon will level up, increasing it's damage and sometimes overall playstyle. Platforming is a secondary, as you may come across arrays of spikes or other hazards that must be outright avoided with you gaining a new form of mobility later on. The game definitely has a learning curve, and the final areas and bosses can be quite difficult, but the learning curve is relatively friendly.\n\nOverall, with an endearing story, lovable characters, great gameplay and amazing music, i cannot recommend this game enough, but do pixel a favor and don't buy it. download the aeon genesis translation here: https://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php", "timestamp_created": 1629389505, "timestamp_updated": 1629389505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820168554782867432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97805341": {"recommendationid": "97805341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155600100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1300, "last_played": 1677194847}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1629299139, "timestamp_updated": 1629299139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97782478": {"recommendationid": "97782478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053505065", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 999, "last_played": 1618977998}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyed this game and the atmosphere.

That's not the biggest flaw of it though, it's the fact that it resets all dialog and all switches and everything, making it really tidious and demotivating when that happens. Then there are points where the save point is far away from the boss, like one boss that kills you in like 4 hits. There's also a collectable on the way that resets every time you die unless you get it and go all the way back to save. Then the bosses. Some of the bosses feel really all over the place and messy with their projectile spam. I understand that they can probably be good on replays, but on the first go you're basically forced to half-tank those bosses. Then there's unneccessarily convolluted parts, like having to get jelly to go through a fireplace for no reason and it's easily missable, if you skip dialog and then you'll be stuck having to go over everything or watching a walkthrough. I haven't finished the game yet, but these are my problems with the game so far. The good parts are the ost, and how charming the characters are and I suppose the gameplay and uniqueness. But I don't really get the same enjoyment from this as some other game with more polished gameplay.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nAnd 4 diffrent bosses in a row in the end WITH the weapon downgrade system AND there's random almost chaotic projectiles in the last phase....? ugh I hate this game so much no matter how many chances I give it. Difficulty for me is fine. But redoing easy things or things you fully know how to do already because you fail is just garbage. I honestly want to give this game something like 5/10.

Enough to keep me hooked to play toward a mediocre ending. However, I cannot in my heart recommend it.\n\nLet me start with the positives. The world is open and scattered aspects of it seem to build a likable and distinctive world. A race of cute bunny people, some names and a little bit of history, outsiders staying on, some drama and conflict with valid concerns on part of a grumpy rabbit, and why lie: Some of the female characters shown are, as far as simplified pixel-women go, fairly attractive. Can't deny I had a thing for Misty, Curly Brace, and the transmogrified rabbit-human-girl.\n\nGameplay, I remember, is navigable, and can be occasionally outright fun. That being said, other times I remember it can be quite awkward. Often enough, I say, that it can make clearing some sections that should feel epic more like a chore. If 2D shooter combat is what you're after, I recommend looking elsewhere, such as at Ian Campbell's Bleed games, or at the Cally's Caves franchise.\n\nThe biggest appeal for gameplay in my opinion is the exploration and the progression. Getting a new weapon is satisfying, as is testing it out. Moreover, when you finally find doors, gates, objects, and characters of interest in the world, it can feel satisfying. Each of those, though, are relatively sparsely populated; the middling combat experience is more common and stands between each.\n\n--\n\nThe Story is arguably the biggest deal-breaker for me. It starts out interesting, and increasingly so. Characters and rules of the world are introduced that seem like they could be important, and create a web of intrigue that could truly feel rich and deep.\n\nThat is not the case. Many characters and rules I met that are interesting and set a potent first impression, enough to commit them to memory for later in the experience, play a role only once or twice later in the game and then they just disappear or outright die off. Like a kid at his very first story-circle experience in the school's creative writing club, shooting off items back to back while it's still his turn, Cave Story's, well, story, is just a bunch of factors tacked on of which almost none- I honestly want to say, none outright- of the characters or places we meet actually get fleshed out enough to matter. \n\n--\n\nThis makes two general elements of Cave Story that would be good, not so much:\n\n=I have heard that Cave Story has more than one ending. Well, for me, multiple endings only matter if the story elements and the world itself are memorable, likable, and interconnected; the multiple endings can give a chance to learn how different choices can affect the same characters we care about differently.\n\nWith too little to go on to care about these characters, and with the story being all over the place, this would-be boon that could bring me back is downgraded to a neutral.\n\n-Cave Story's story, dialogue, sequence of events, world, and imagery are very dark. I would like very strongly to consider this to be a positive. Sincerely dark stories with cartoonish imagery and non-human characters, frankly, are extremely rare. Especially in games. I've wanted to find one for quite a while.\n\nHowever, with the characters being fleeting after their first impressions, the darkness of Cave Story is just unsettling. It seems like the writers are just out to freak the audience out as much as possible by throwing whatever creepy or tragic thing they can at you, and there's an uncanny valley disparity between how much the characters are supposed to matter and how much they actually do- and in turn how much it matters that these dark things happen to them. In fact like the character themselves, the dark stuff just gets piled on one after the other without any apparent structure or reverence.\n\n--\n\nClearly there's an audience out there that is keen on Cave Story. Enough for it to have the following it does. However, I for one cannot mentally put myself in their shoes. Cave Story offers a good promise, but it falls short on too much. I must recommend against it.

In the beginning part, you\u2019ll be introduced to your first weapon of the story, the Polar Star. Throughout your journey you\u2019ll meet the mimiga, a race of small goat looking creatures. You\u2019ll get to know about them more as the story goes on. \n\nI would say more but I highly suggest you go check it out for yourself, game\u2019s fun as hell and I\u2019m honestly surprised this game hasn\u2019t gotten a lot of attention recently (or at all tbh). I will leave you with one more thing, there\u2019s exactly three endings to this game, one of which being the true ending.

I have played the first hour a few times but never committed to finishing it, even though I knew it would 100% be my type of game.\n\nI've finally finished it and what a journey. It has that fantastic feel of a classic retro platformer but with the greatly needed polish. The pixel art is charming and creative. The soundtrack is fantastic and most importantly it carves out its own style as some form of platformer, shooter, 'metroidvania-lite' hybrid. I played on the normal difficulty and some parts were very challenging which I really appreciate.\n\nFrom what I've gathered, I got one of a few endings.

Some are quite entertaining (IMO the Sand Zone was the best) while others are either bland or really frustrating.\n\nWhile the bosses do have a smooth difficulty curve I've never been a fan of them being balanced around spawning minions that you can kill for resources, a type of boss of which this game has plenty of, specially in its later stages. The final boss can also be quite frustrating since dying in that battle means you have to rebattle 3 bosses before you get to them again.\n\nOverall, it is a game that progresses the way you'd imagine a very short metroidvania would, but some of its mechanics haven't aged well for me.", "timestamp_created": 1624206210, "timestamp_updated": 1624206210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93961106": {"recommendationid": "93961106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392281177", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "playtime_at_review": 1453, "last_played": 1699769494}, "language": "english", "review": "[strike] Play the freeware version honestly [/strike]\n\n[b] October 2022: [/b]Keep this data on hand and use it in tandem with Doukutsu-RS, by far the best way to play this game on PC (Windows, Linux, Mac)", "timestamp_created": 1624035562, "timestamp_updated": 1666821744, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602300703525543213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93916551": {"recommendationid": "93916551", "author": {"steamid": "76561199062890372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 489, "last_played": 1624642192}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game well worth it's reputation.

What started out as a Flash-based, platformer shooter, got eventually remastered for release on PC and other platforms.\n\nYou play as a soldier robot, Quote, who wakes up without memories in an underground world inhabited by dangerous and cute creatures (even both). You'll also find Mimiga, the sentient species who play the major role in your story progress. Pieces of the story background will fall into place as you find new locations and characters, which have lead into this current state of environment the game is based on. The characters - good and bad - are quite memorable, in spite of my subdued awareness of what's going on in the first place but it got easier to grasp when I came back and started over to finish Cave Story. There are multiple endings to it and then there's the true ending that is even more satisfying but oh, so extreme to enable. If you're like me, you'd stick to a walkthrough guide strictly to not miss any minor criterias necessary and even then, you'll have a long final stage to clear your way on while staying alive. I'm sure the satisfaction level there is on par with Dark Souls but personally, I called quits and resorted to watching a playthrough on Youtube instead. For shame, oh me... ^_^\n\nThe action gameplay gets slippery at times, as my character maneuvres a little faster than necessary for platforming scenes but it's bearable enough for me to reach the standard ending. The choices you make affect what arsenal you'll have along the way but all in all, most of them are quite practical for ground and mid-air combat, situationally.\n\nThe remastered version not only improves the visuals but also presents overhauled soundtrack, which in itself is mostly catchy and memorable. You're also free to switch to older versions of the soundtrack for some lo-fi experience but the new ones are relatively meaty and livelier.\n\nI can understand why Cave Story is a cult classic of its time, considering its fragmented yet cohesive story, adorable cast and a varied world to explore. If you can bear the twitchy nature of platforming, saving habits, optionally even dare undertake the punishing means for the true ending, Cave Story+ is worth playing through.\n\nPersonal favorite soundtrack: Meltdown.", "timestamp_created": 1621712689, "timestamp_updated": 1621734148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92423082": {"recommendationid": "92423082", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994665129", "num_games_owned": 1077, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 845, "last_played": 1622637384}, "language": "english", "review": "It was good until the end bosses.", "timestamp_created": 1621705157, "timestamp_updated": 1646260436, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455837994813919067", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92418313": {"recommendationid": "92418313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136211586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 5474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1561, "last_played": 1688322206}, "language": "english", "review": "fun (HELP)", "timestamp_created": 1621699697, "timestamp_updated": 1688322878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46268656849861145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92415222": {"recommendationid": "92415222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289183924", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1636135049}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1621696009, "timestamp_updated": 1621696009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46268656849861145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92158332": {"recommendationid": "92158332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870992865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1621715669}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolute masterpiece.

It has incredible gameplay, great pixel art, legendary music and a great story with lots of lore.  This game can be acquired for free (legally), but its worth buying here for the HD graphics update, remastered soundtrack, new rush modes, difficulty settings and achievements. \n\nCave Story feels great to play and the game does a good job at pushing players to slowly mastering the game. The gameplay is based around using a jet pack that lets the player move in any direction and make complicated maneuvers with a limited energy bar. The game has ten different kinds of guns that encourage different styles of fighting that are all viable. All the guns can be upgraded and are all worth using. The game is pretty complicated and becomes really challenging, but this happens over the course of the game so its not overwhelming. Cave Story game only demands some level of mastery near the end of a playthrough, and only demands mastery for the true ending (which should be done on a second playthrough).  This version of the game adds an easy setting, but even that difficulty is challenging as it just means a few extra hearts. \n\nCave story has great pixel art for both its gameplay and cutscenes. The in-game art is very functional as its easy to tell what is happening on screen despite there being tons of enemies and bullets on the screen. The story plays out in-game with text, but it does the job of showing what is happening while allowing the imagination to fill in the details.  The character portraits for even minor characters are great and the few cutscenes in the game are very memorable. \n\nThe Cave Story soundtrack is legendary. The game has a diverse soundtrack of 8-bit music that reflects the moods of places in the game and moments in the story very well. The soundtrack holds up on its own as music and songs do not get old even on stages that demand lots of repeats. \n\nThe story of Cave Story has multiple endings that justify multiple playthroughs, but the way these endings are handled is very strange. It would better to not spoil the story, but it is one of heroes, corrupting evil and sacrifice. Its very memorable and there is a lot of lore to uncover so its worth paying attention to. The way the multiple endings are handled is very strange, and a guide is required to get them. The way that the true ending is reached is very arbitrary and convoluted. There are multiple triggers for alternative endings that can be easily missed, but for a first playthrough the game can be played blind just fine. \n\nCave Story is a masterpiece, and its amazing that the game was made by a single developer in their spare time. This version of the game in particular is very much worth getting. \n", "timestamp_created": 1615351527, "timestamp_updated": 1615351527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630127787590026855", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87973520": {"recommendationid": "87973520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836170471", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1680012365}, "language": "english", "review": "While the original is free, this is still worth the money.

The most important is that the controls are tricky like Super Mario and are designed to make the platforming difficult. Imagine you are always moving over slippery surfaces, so you struggle to gain traction as you start to run and you slide forward a bit when you stop running or when you land after jumping. It is designed to make you fall off platforms which can be frustrating. Beware there is a boss rush at the end of the game - I gave up at the last boss because it was a hassle having to re-fight the bosses before the last boss. Don't expect the game to always allow you save right before boss fights.

It was created in 2004, after 5 years in continuous development, and it was released for free. That's right, there's a freeware version online. After the gigantic interest from the media and the great reviews, which claimed it even rivaled paid games such as GBA games Metroid and Castlevania, it was ported for free to Xbox, and in 2011 Cave Story+ arrived in Steam; re-translated, with a revamped soundtrack, improved graphics, and extra modes, making it a commercial success on PC. It was also released on the Nintendo shop.\n\nThe age doesn't matter, it still is an amazing metroidvania experience, with one of the best soundtracks created. There are some interesting mechanics that haven't been picked up in other games. For example, the leveling system of the weapons; Basically, you have 4 levels per weapon. You receive exp by killing enemies with them, and that improves the weapon. And here's the catch: if you get hit, you'll lose exp. This makes for an interesting mechanic, forcing the players to try their best to not get hurt, not only because of the HP, but also for the experience points, handicapping you even further.\n\nThe game is not extremely long, you can beat it in 12-18 hours, and there aren't boring sequences. The story goes straight ahead, revealing itself step by step, without the cutscenes/texts being tiring or time consuming.\n\nI recommend it completely to any fan of the genre, and if you're feeling extra cheap, get the freeware version.

The game looks decent, its done its best to match the 2004 pixel art version with updated looks that don't lose the charm of the original. The game play is pretty tight with a good amount of control that I did feel like it was my fault if I messed up... To an extent, but I'll get into that in a sec. And the story and characters are well done enough that I did want to keep going to see more of them and what would happen. HOWEVER\n\nFUCKKKKKKK The difficulty spikes in this game! Oh holy shit! I cannot tell you just how awful going for the true ending is. I do want to complain a bit about that but the game makes you go out of your way to go after it (and I only knew about it from word of mouth so I only have myself to blame) like not going to help someone after they look to fall to their near death, which you could only possibly know on a second play through. But if you do know about it and try to go for it... First of all have a walk through open because there is shit that you will need to know ahead of time or you'll miss it. Secondly Good Fucking Luck. Because I consider myself decent at platformers but the last cave (hidden) was nearly a 3 hour affair for me. And then I got to the last area, the blood stained sanctuary and imagine the hardest bullet hell platformer you've ever seen. And stretch that to 9 minutes with 4 bosses in it. AND NO SAVE POINTS! No thanks. I'm not dedicating 12 hours of my life to that.\nBut my real complaint about Cave Story 17 years later is that there just isn't enough checkpoints. The game is already frustratingly difficult without having to backtrack miles to get to where you just were. The final boss coming to mind which has a 4 part gauntlet with very little health drops during. But on the other hand if this game did get more liberal with the checkpoints the game would lose all its difficulty and you'd be done with it in about 4 hours. Which fair enough if you're looking for that level of challenge. I thought I was but ended up biting off more then I could really chew.\nCave Story is a very important game for the indi scene but at the same time I don't know that I could call it worth playing now. If you're into the history of gaming I do think its a notable game that you should try, but I don't think you should be required to finish it.

The story is passable with a rather interesting plot about slavery, robots, and magic, but when you start thinking about it harder it starts to really show it's holes.

(Also Nicalis is trying to take down the original works and fan translations which is even worse)\n\nSo if not the bad translation and you giving your money to a false company who only worked on the free ware versions of the game and didn't actually make Cave Story? What else do I have an issue with?\n\nWell, first off, my massive issue with the resolution. I run 1920 x 1080. Cave Story has a Fullscreen mode and Windowed mode, with no inbetween. There is Fill (which looks awful as sin) and Sharp, which scales the game down to fit your screen (often with black space). But for my monitor, it doesn't even fit the whole game screen! There's ALWAYS a bottom part of the screen I can't see with no workarounds to it. You CAN try to resize the window, but that might end up stretching the game screen in a way you really don't want it to. \n\nI'd like to talk about the Nicalis translation for this game. I personally really hate this translation. Characters often have less personality to them (notably Kazuma at the start of the game when messaging Sue) and it really bothers me.\n\nHonestly, I'm probably rambling too much about stuff that doesn't matter but that's because I really care about this game. \nIf you'd like to play Cave Story, play the original on the fan site. There's translations for all languages, (use the pre-patched English version) and I _believe_ you can get +'s graphics in the original, including widescreen and more.\n\n+ is pretty, yes, but I'm not a fan of the new music and all,  and that's just personal preference.\nPlay the original with the fan translation.", "timestamp_created": 1606996624, "timestamp_updated": 1606996624, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799079537391662598", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81502838": {"recommendationid": "81502838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038372484", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3746, "last_played": 1691859651}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool story and surprisingly deep gameplay.

Play this game if you can, it's wonderful, just don't buy it. Cave Story was originally published for free online, and hopefully it's still available as such, either in its original form or in fan remakes. Note the phrasing \"hopefully\". We'll get to that later. For now, I'll just proceed like this is a normal review.\n\nCave Story is a true indie game in the spirit that game like Super Meat Boy, Spelunky, and even small-studio games like Supergiant's Hades are carrying on, made by a single talented (and somewhat reclusive) japanese dev known online as 'Pixel'.\n\nGameplay-wise, Cave Story is a light metroidvania with a heavy emphasis on shooting, with a variety of weapons available to choose from, although not all of them are available in every run. The game's relatively unique weapon experience system rewards with experience shards for killing enemies, which upgrade your individual weapon if you collect enough to fill up its experience bar, but you lose that experience if you take damage, rewarding high-performance gameplay simply and effectively. Most weapons have three levels of experience, and will gain additional effects as they increase in level, like firing several more projectiles, or firing in a different pattern. \n\nThe game is also pretty short (beatable in around two hours for a player who's reasonably familiar with it), highly replayable (there are a few choices early on in the game that have effects later on, changing which weapons you get at certain points or determining your elegibility for the best ending), and can be extremely difficult near the end, especially on the route to the best ending. It's a great way to burn a few hours on a fun, but fairly simple game experience, it's a reasonable challenge for players interested in being challenged, it's a good game all around, just... *don't buy it.*\n\nSo, that all sounds great, right? Cave Story + is a wonderful game, so why shouldn't you buy it?\nNicalis, the publisher, are awful people.\nPixel originally published Cave Story for free online, similarly to other cult-classic japanese indie titles like Yume Nikki, and Cave Story + is an enhanced remake created for sale, which is now published by Nicalis. Reportedly, under the contract Pixel signed with Nicalis, they get 0% of the money from Nicalis's sales of Cave Story +, because Pixel was lied to about the contents of the contract.\nFurthermore, Nicalis are now undergoing an aggressive DMCA-takedown campaign against every freeware version of Cave Story they can find online, whether it uses the source code they actually own or not, which is in direct conflict with the spirit in which Pixel originally developed the game.\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg too. There are all sorts of reports about Nicalis management being horrible human beings and not just a predatory publisher, and furthermore reports of them mistreating other indie devs they've published for.\n\nSo, in summary: Cave Story + is a wonderful game, but Nicalis don't deserve your money.

There are a few too many weapons to discover which makes swapping between them mid-boss infeasible, but the ability to exchange your starting weapon for one of multiple weapons throughout the game is neat and affords fair replayability.\n\nIn a peculiar design decision, an optional late-game upgrade fundamentally changes movement mechanisms which unlocks a series of end-game challenges that are awesome to behold.\n\nIts story delivers, by the bye.

After having dropped a good amount of time into it, I can see why it pioneered the indie space in the way it did.\n\nThe gameplay has tight controls, though the player feels like it has a lot of weight to it (I got used to it pretty quick). The story was a lot more compelling than I expected it to be and took a lot of interesting turns; it didn't feel like it fell into many tropey narratives. The lore is also pretty deep and there's a lot of backstory to just about everything you come across, and for the most part you actually have to go digging for it which I really like.\n\nThere is a good deal of replay value based on certain decisions you make over the course of any playthrough, which can affect what items you can obtain and a couple of mutually-exclusive outcomes and endings.\n\nThe secret challenge area at the end of the game is incredibly difficult and I have not completed it as of yet. It pushes the game's mechanics and level design as well as your abilities to their limits in such a brutal way; expect to die a lot in the process of working your way deeper each time.\n\nThere are a couple of areas I thought could have been done better (there are a couple of [i]very[/i] specific things you need to do to save certain characters that were not outlined anywhere I could find except online in guides or wikis), but given that this was basically the first game of its type I can hardly fault it. In some ways it's a throwback to classic games from the 80's and 90's that explained little and forced people to collaborate with each other to figure it out. I have mixed feelings on this method of design but it does get people talking and brainstorming, which I love the detective aspect of.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy Cave Story and all it has to offer.

Right at the beginning, you realize that it is a game with a lot of personalities, the style is very particular, interesting, with a very good soundtrack.

While it was short, it was simple and sweet, too, and there's a ton of replayability this game will present to you.\n\nYou play as Quote, an amnesiac robot soldier sent in from the surface to the underground caverns of a floating island who is mistakenly believed to be on a mission to slaughter all the Mimiga, the species of rabbit-dog like creatures who are forced to carry out orders under the control of the Doctor, who is using the power of the Demon Crown to his own will. He's planning to feed the Mimiga red flowers so they can transform into monstrous creatures so the Doctor can lead an army of them on the surface to take over it. But worry not, you will meet characters along the way who will aid you in your perilous journey to interfere with the Doctor's nefarious plans and to save the Mimiga and the rest of the world. Such characters include: \n\u2022 Curly Brace; another amnesiac robot soldier who is very emotional and shows a soft spot for the Mimiga\n\u2022 Sue Sakamoto; a human turned into a Mimiga who is hiding from the Doctor's capture\n\u2022 Kazuma Sakamoto; Sue's brother, who was one of the scientists who arrived on the island along with his family and the Doctor\n\u2022 Momorin Sakamoto; Sue and Kazuma's mother, who was an aid to the Doctor before he betrayed her\n\u2022 Professor Booster; another one of the research team's scientists who specializes in rocket jetpacks\nand more!\n\nYou'll also meet many enemies and bosses who will stand in your way, such as Misery, a haughty and arrogant servant to the Doctor who possesses witch powers, Balrog, who works alongside Misery to crush any soldier who gets in the Crown Holder's way, and Ballos, who, without spoiling, will ultimately become one of the biggest threats in the game.\n\nAnd now for the pros and cons for this game - \n\nPros: \n\u2022 Allows switching between original and remastered graphics, as well as old and new music\n\u2022 As noted above, the game contains many memorable characters who will work with or defy you, and none feel cheesy or poorly written\n\u2022 The game can be really humorous at times, while serious at other points, providing a balance that makes for a grabbing and attentive experience\n\u2022 Loads of weapon choices and upgrades, including your trusty and reliable Polar Star, the Machine Gun that allows you to hover in mid-air by firing, and the Missile Launcher that blast foes and deals tons of damage. You can also trade your weapon in (the Polar Star) to get other powerful choices as well!\n\u2022 Soundtrack is one of the best things you'll ever hear in a video game, from emotional pieces to uplifting songs that will send you blasting your way throughout the underground caverns\n\u2022 Secrets and item upgrades await to make you an even more stronger soldier\n\u2022 Challenging and hectic boss fights that will send you scrambling on the edge of your seat\n\u2022 Additional bonuses, such as Curly Story, where you play from Curly's point of view, and several challenge modes\n\u2022 Tons of achievements to collect for the nifty achievement hunter\n\u2022 One of the neatest little aspects is if you alt-tab out of the game, the game's currently playing music will play in the background but in a lower volume\n\nCons:\n\u2022 Enemies damage you frequently and can overwhelm you if you're not careful enough where you're stepping\n\u2022 No proper fullscreen ratio, but the original ratio will add a classic flair to the game\n\u2022 There are no objective reminders, so you really need to focus on NPC dialogue as well as look through computer terminals to know where you're going\n\nA classic and one of the most iconic indie games of all time, Cave Story, or Doukutsu Monogatari, is simply one of the best games you can get on Steam. It was developed, composed, and drawn by a lone developer, Pixel, and his work shines through, comparatively better than what other teams of developers can even put out today. It's also available for free at https://www.cavestory.org/ as a free download, so if you wish to support him there as well, I highly support that notion. Now, get on and save the fate of the Mimiga already, their lives as well as many others are depending on you!", "timestamp_created": 1597165938, "timestamp_updated": 1597165938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611021041870117188", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74136221": {"recommendationid": "74136221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069271439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1598106112}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't buy this game.

It manages to always be engaging and so much fun because you arent bored that its too easy but you certainly embrace the challenge- especially those who dare to seek the True Ending. \nAnd yknow whats funny? I NEVER got the True Ending yet and a decade later, I strive to overcome and prevail.\nEverything you do feels satisfying: exploring and finding a secret weapon, boss fights, backtracking- oh, did I mention the music? I'd love to explain how the music is the best in its genre but you'll have to play to know ;) (or youtube it ya lazy butt :p)\nEither way, words still fail me to this day how such a masterful game could exist. Don't got $15? Go to the official tribute site and play it for FREE!!! That'd right, the original was a passion project which Pixel, the developer, made the programs to make the music and sprites from scratch and then used those programs to make the game AND release it for free.\nThis game deserves all your love, whether you want to experience the hella nice 16-bit sprites or dont got any money, its there for everyone to enjoy.\nConclusion: PLAY IT ALREADY!!!

Hace tiempo que no tengo la urgencia de escribir un an\u00e1lisis sobre un producto que consumo, tal vez la \u00faltima vez que tuve esta sensaci\u00f3n con Steins;Gate, el cual sigue siendo el an\u00e1lisis m\u00e1s largo que he escrito hasta la fecha, exponiendo en no s\u00e9 cu\u00e1ntos p\u00e1rrafos lo superlativamente mala que me pareci\u00f3. No he tenido tanto asco por un videojuego desde hace mucho tiempo, cuya racha ha sido cortada por Cave Story.\n\nSe me hace un poco dif\u00edcil ordenar mis pensamientos, pero hablar\u00e9 en primer lugar sobre su jugabilidad. El juego en s\u00ed es un indie shooter plataformero en el que tendremos que abrirnos camino a golpe de un arsenal de armas relativamente amplio acorde a su duraci\u00f3n. La realidad es que, en mi caso, acab\u00e9 usando s\u00f3lo el lanzacohetes y la machine gun, y en ocasiones contadas la bola de fuego, por lo que no dir\u00eda que la implementaci\u00f3n de todas ellas sea correcta. En s\u00ed, aparte de las armas, el juego es de lo m\u00e1s gen\u00e9rico que pueda existir en cuanto a jugabilidad. Pegas saltos, disparas, coges el drop del enemigo, el cual proporciona experiencia para subir niveles a las armas (lo cual lo considero un acierto, ya que nos hace ser m\u00e1s cuidadosos a la hora de recibir da\u00f1o puesto que el arma que llevamos equipada baja de nivel), salud o cohetes para el lanzacohetes. \n\nEn cuanto al apartado art\u00edstico, el juego luce fatal para m\u00ed. Es decir, me mostraba reluctante hacia la adquisici\u00f3n del t\u00edtulo porque se ve\u00eda ins\u00edpido de cojones, pero bueno, quiz\u00e1s s\u00f3lo fuese ese aspecto, \u00bfverdad?  Spoiler: no.\n\nReferente a la historia, aqu\u00ed es donde est\u00e1 el punto de inflexi\u00f3n. Cuando llevaba 2 horas de juego, me dec\u00eda: \"Bueno, pese a que el juego se note cl\u00f3nico en cuanto a mec\u00e1nicas, se vea soso de cojones y los personajes parezcan de pl\u00e1stico, quiz\u00e1s sea porque a\u00fan no le ha dado tiempo a desarrollarse\" Qu\u00e9 equivocado estaba. La premisa en s\u00ed no est\u00e1 mal. Si alguien viene y me dice que ha jugado a un juego que trata sobre unas criaturas que viven en una isla flotante, las cuales al tomar unas flores rojas se ponen hasta las cejas de speed y que son controladas por un malo maloso que se aprovecha de ellas y utiliza a estos espec\u00edmenes para conquistar la superficie terrestre, podr\u00eda considerarlo ligeramente interesante. O sea, el argumento es el tipiqu\u00edsimo personaje tirano que se aprovecha de los m\u00e1s d\u00e9biles para ejercer su poder, pero t\u00fa tomas el rol del h\u00e9roe y junto al poder de la amistad y de tus cojines, ser\u00e1s capaz de derrotarlo y hacer que la paz reine. No obstante, se puede moldear lo suficientemente como para que pueda llegar a atraerme. Pero... \u00bfadivin\u00e1is qu\u00e9? No es el caso. \n\nLa historia se desarrolla sac\u00e1ndose personajes de los cojones de los cuales ni siquiera se vuelve a saber nada, no importa cu\u00e1l de los tres finales escojas. Creo que la relaci\u00f3n que se establece entre algunos es antinatural y sin sentido (excepto con Sue, que entiendo que se llegue hasta tal punto porque desde el primer momento te presentan su actitud y personalidad). Lo mejor, sin duda, son los tres finales. A cual peor, por el amor de Jes\u00fas de Nazaret. O sea, me parecen tan tan tan tan rid\u00edculos que no s\u00e9 si tom\u00e1rmelos como humor involuntario. O sea, lo poco que construye el juego en cuanto a v\u00ednculos en personajes, se lo pasan por las axilas. Lo mejor es que los personajes de la historia se lo pasan a\u00fan m\u00e1s por las axilas y el nivel de sudapollismo que alcanzan por no saber la situaci\u00f3n del resto de compa\u00f1eros me resulta a\u00fan m\u00e1s jocoso. S\u00f3lo me viene a la cabeza el final de The Departed, pero lo mejor es que Cave Story lo hace elevado al cubo. Maravilloso.\n\nPor si fuera poco, tengo que hablar (sin spoilers) del final y de su dificultad. He de decir que lo jugu\u00e9 en modo normal. El grueso del transcurso del videojuego se me hizo correcto. Es decir, hay bosses que me mataron una o dos veces, pero que al pillarle el truco son asequibles, pero cuando llegamos al final, el juego coge la curva de dificultad y le pega un subid\u00f3n que parece el pico de tensi\u00f3n que alcanza un coraz\u00f3n a 400 bpm.

This game has multiple different endings I think 3 in total so that's an interesting addition to the game and it doesn't really hinder anything. \n\nI'd give this game a 7/10 it's been out since 2011 and this release could be tweaked with 4k support but overall if you can get it cheap it can be a fun 4-5 hour long game depending upon how many platformers you've played and how you find the controls. \n\nSo yeah pretty good for being made entirely by 1 man.", "timestamp_created": 1594588034, "timestamp_updated": 1594588034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72548994": {"recommendationid": "72548994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061098687", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1619710703}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una gran aventura con diferentes dificultades y finales.

Yes, I definitely recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1593644530, "timestamp_updated": 1593644530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71780450": {"recommendationid": "71780450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013931636", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6995, "last_played": 1643340456}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my absolute FAVOURITE game of all time and always will be. Here's why:\n\nFirst off, for a game witch the word \"story\" in it's title, it conveys a great tale. The game begins with you -- an amnesic robot -- waking up in a mysterious cave. From then on, more is slowly revealed about the character you play as. Without spoiling anything: this is truly an amnesia tale done right as you connect with the protagonist when discovering all the secrets of this world with him. Anyway, Throughout your journey you will be encountering all sorts of characters with varied personalities and their own reasons to be on the floating island that you explore. Even all the bosses have motives and are distinctive in their own way.\n\nNext up, I want to touch on the graphic and audio design of the game. This game released back in 2004 as a freeware game but it's oldness is NOT the reason for it's charming pixel graphics. I believe that the graphics were intended to look like old console games to make the game different or fill the player with nostalgia. This was an interesting choice since postmodernism was very rare amongst videogames at the time and it made Cave Story -- again -- unique. And the spritework is very well-made and natural anyway. Okay, now for the soundtrack... IT'S SUPER BRILLIANT! It adds so much atmosphere and fits super well wherever you are. There's heaps of bops and great tunes that are just a pleasure to listen to in free time as well.\n\nAlright, now to address what the game plays like. I'd say the genre for the general gameplay is Metroidvania but then again, the game is pretty linear. There's also heaps of platforming challenges and enemies to face and-- Oh, right, the platforming! I just can't get over how good it feels to even JUMP in this game. It perfectly strikes the balance between floatyness and tightness. Aside from jumping, your other main move is shooting your wide arsenal of guns! Every weapon feels unique and different, and you'll always find yourself switching from one to another as a way of adapting to your surroundings.\n\nTo conclude: This game is an absolute MASTERPIECE and even replay value in the forms of multiple endings, unlockable challenges, and Steam achievements. But above all, I decided to review this game as it has the defining characteristic of what I believe to be an outstanding game: replay value from a game's sheer quality.\n\n[h1] TL;DR/RANKING: [/h1]\n[b] Personal Ranking: [/b] [i] Favourite (10/10) [/i]\n[b] Recommendation: [/b] [i] Stop reading reviews and buy it already!

After scouring the internet for any concrete evidence, this appears to be complete conjecture, and Pixel even confirmed on his Twitter that he receives royalties from Cave Story + .  I\u2019m not saying this publisher is innocent or anything, but I couldn\u2019t find any evidence in the case of Cave Story.  I did buy Pixel\u2019s other game, Kero Blaster (different publisher), to make sure I was supporting the dev just in case.\n\nSecond, I was worried that, this being the iconic grandpa of the indie platformer/metroidvania/faux 16-bit movement that I love so much, I was worried that it wouldn\u2019t live up to the hype.  Old games can often feel more like museum exhibits than anything else (looking at you KOTOR)\u2026  \n\nWell, luckily none of that was founded in anything but my own doubts and I was completely spellbound by everything Cave Story through at me.  The setting, the narrative, the secrets, the OST, the charm, the boss battles\u2026 it all just screams of that quality and focus that only really comes with single dev projects.  There really is just something magical about the way it all comes together, and while it certainly is an homage to the 16-bit platformers of yore, it doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like a nostalgia trip.  If you like these kinds of games, this is definitely worth picking up.  My only real nit pick is the floaty controls, in that the whole game feels a bit like the ice levels from Donkey Kong Country.  So many of the times I died was coz I couldn\u2019t get used to the floaty jumping or the constant skidding.  \n\nAll in all, this really is a masterpiece and I\u2019m glad I eventually bit the bullet and got it.

Original freeware release ran on 50fps. All Nicalis releases run on 60fps. That means that game plays 20% faster than intended. Well, maybe intended, original indie dev said that game in development used to run at 60fps but he wasn't clear whether he recalculated physics math when it got changed to 50fps and if it was so early at a time when Cave Story was a nearly completely different game. But that's how humanity has been experiencing the game until 2011~, soooooo...\n\nOtherwise, New graphics don't appeal to me, the higher resolution not fitting to having same animation frames. Not too shabby tho. Now, both New and Remastered soundtrack seemed to not fit well, the first being not even good remixes and the latter being very \"arranged\" where it doesn't feel like it's coming from a game but out of nearby Sega CD. But you can still use old, original graphic and music.\n\nTranslation is different from original fan-translation, but it's all just wording. Fans prefer the 'original'. Seem to be flawed in different ways. You can mod in original however.\n\nNew gameplay stuff are just extra modes and extra bugs. Which is cool, I guess, but I am on a fence since I heard that Nicalis are literally indie EA.\nSure, difficulty select and three save slots tho. Easy is way too easy, I heard, Hard is CBT from what I read.\n\nWhat I want to say, is that it won't hurt you to just play freeware original. Which I will, using Cave Story Engine 2, where it has widescreen, can pick between 60 or 50 fps and has VSync and smooth scrolling which ought to help with jerkyness of 50fps on certain setups.\n\nEDIT: Actually, it seems like it has Wind Fortress that you can unlock as extra, which was scrapped zone that doesn't fit to current Cave Story line but maybe cool as a bonus? Uhhhh, this is now a harder decision. Ah well, will just YouTube it, still not wanting to support Nicalis right now.\n\nEDIT2: Removed rumor that Nicalis might have been unfair to Pixel, the original dev, cus research on facts brought nothing, it's probably just a fantazy. But Nicalis are still horrible to other devs. But if anything, Pixel is still making money, to my knowledge.\nUhhhh, if I start not buying games based on that, I will have to really rethink my purchase choices.

is a charming game, made by one person with a passion for games, the weapons are simple and pretty good sounding, the enemies are different in every zone and they never get boring, the 16-bit ish new

it you will never forget it, and now to the gampla- Yes movement is good its nothing out of the other world it works really good and if you get the booster 2.0 the levels are designed with the booster in mind like high places where you can unlock secrets! Oh yea the replayability! this game has 6 endings, thats already great, theres the bad one the normal one and the truly good one to name a few (fun fact the really good ending is hell on earth) but hey theres also weapons you can get like if they were sidequests, more characters to talk to and god the characters are for me unforgettable like and the dialog is pretty funny and sometimes serious, (if you've never played the freeware version and play this one theres minor translation changes that makes the experience for the people that played that version not the same as this one, im fine with it but I really missed the \"Huzzah!\" from Balrog) uh I went a little bit out of track.\nIn conclusion this games is one of the best Indie games to have existed and is the grandfather of indie games, 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1593046817, "timestamp_updated": 1598825880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71287897": {"recommendationid": "71287897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798946911", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 536, "last_played": 1644561045}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun as hell", "timestamp_created": 1593027268, "timestamp_updated": 1593027268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71259449": {"recommendationid": "71259449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309511270", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1594013728}, "language": "english", "review": "very mimiga\nmuch good", "timestamp_created": 1592980170, "timestamp_updated": 1592980170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71210782": {"recommendationid": "71210782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088029027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 513, "last_played": 1694557322}, "language": "english", "review": "Games good\n", "timestamp_created": 1592895471, "timestamp_updated": 1592895471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71193685": {"recommendationid": "71193685", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994506121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1348729200}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolute platforming classic to rival the original super metroid.

I'd consider myself pretty adept with video games in general but I've never dipped my feet extensively into platformers that much and would thus not claim to be an expert at them, but more slightly above average. There are three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard. I went through two full playthroughs on normal, and I will say that Cave Story gave me lots of trouble more than just a handful of times. And there are a few specific parts of the game which saw me replaying sections at least ten times, and one of those (optionally) over 50 times.\n\nWith that said, I never felt like I died due to some random bullshit. Although it is annoying to replay entire sections and segments before boss battles and having to go through sequences and dialogue multiple times instead of skipping to where I was before I died (what a game like Celeste handles perfectly), I would say that it's still not an entirely bad thing as it encourages me to play smartly and master a segment so I don't mess it up. Cave Story is very much a game that requires you to \"get good\" so to speak, but it's good to know that even the hardest sections aren't impossible.\n\nTwo of the greatest facets of this game are its soundtrack and its replayability. Have you ever played through a game and had its soundtrack stuck in your head for days? Cave Story for sure did that to me. With that in mind, the game gives you options to see original graphics, new graphics, the old OST, an one made for the Nintendo DSi version, and a new \"remastered\" version that was made when this game released for the Wii. In my opinion, the DSi version (titled \"New\") is objectively worse in every way, and I could not recommend it. The remastered version attempts to stay true to the tone of the original, opts for more-instrumental music instead of the chiptune-based original. While I would say that the \"Remastered\" one is quite good and some of the songs are excellent, I would honestly still recommend playing through with the original OST. This game did not release during the peak of 8-bit and 16-bit games where music from that time period was a result of the limitations of the systems they were on (albeit it was still great), but released later on and created this way to sound like that specifically. In my opinion, however, I still prefer the new graphics setting to the old, as it is more or less very similar to the original but with higher resolution sprites and textures. It's safe to say that the Original OST is far superior to the others and for a first playthrough, at least, would recommend the new graphics with the original OST. It's really hard to convey just how great the OST is but I'll say that it's really up there as one of my favorites of all time. \n\nThe last thing I'd wish to say about Cave Story is that I appreciate it's extremely-high replayability. It is quite possibly the only game I can recall instantly beginning a new playthrough of right after finishing it. Without spoiling anything, I'd like to offer a tip for a first playthrough. Read reviews to perhaps figure out if you want to buy this game, but try not to read any walkthroughs or spoilers. Most of the segments require you to master them, and their solutions aren't typically too out of the way, so it should not be too difficult. \n\nOnce a first playthrough is finished, read a walkthrough or perhaps look up what secrets you might have missed and begin a second playthrough. This might seem lame or like a cop-out but I genuinely recommend that as the best way to play this game and you'll be able to squeeze maximum enjoyment out of as much playtime as possible. You will be surprised as to how much a large portion of the game's gameplay is altered significantly based on specific choices you make that you'd perhaps have to do out of your way to do.\n\nOnce you do a third playthrough, perhaps scale the difficulty to Hard (or Normal if your first or second were on Easy) and begin again. I myself have not tried that yet, as it seems to be pretty masochistic, but I gladly hope to do so someday. There are also some cool challenge stages available which I enjoyed.\n\nTo reiterate, Cave Story is a fun game with great core gameplay, elevated up by some of its unique gameplay quirks and great replayability, as well as a fantastic score and I would not only recommend it but put it into a category of \"Must-Plays\" for anybody that is a fan of story-driven action platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1592328076, "timestamp_updated": 1592328099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70768484": {"recommendationid": "70768484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965402399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1617084081}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the game, i love the story line to this game.

And when you retry a platforming event four times in a row with this bland and awful music, you just want to uninstall it.\n\nLook, I don't want to bash anyone's hard work, but I paid for this game and I do not intend to return it. As such, I am entitled to criticise it harshly, but fair. So I have to recognise that it has ONE thing in its favour and that is, despite how BAD it is, you want to proceed and see how it ends.

You get a variety of unique weapons that are all upgradeable as you defeat enemies, but lose effectiveness as you take damage. This creates unique game play decisions, especially when confronting new enemies. I don't know how many times during a boss battle I would start with one gun which i preferred, got hit a few times, and then needed to switch guns due to leveling down after I take a hit. Fun mechanic that kept me on my toes! Finally, the graphics are very unique and the music is amazing. Each new zone has a catchy tune to it that really helps immerse you in the level.\n\nIn terms of downsides, I did get frustrated at times with the saves. An autosave feature could have helped relieve that issue, seeing as I would get pretty fall along in a level and then die and have to play it all over again.

There is a story, there are dozens of secrets, three endings and so on. More importantly, the fundamental gameplay of running, jumping and shooting just works very well. The weapon power-ups are implemented in a fun way, you can perform power jumps with the machine gun etc.\nMy main gripe with Cave Story is that the distribution of save points is just badly done. Sometimes there are three in a row but there's usually none before a boss fight. Which means that if you fail (and you will), you need to traverse several rooms full of enemies and tricky jumps, and then endure lots of dialog (which you can speed up, but not skip) to try again. Meh.\nPersonally, I also didn't like the \"skating\" of the main character. I know this is a thing in early console jump and runs, but I personally like games where the character stops moving when I release the key/button. Also, considering the different decisions you can make (willingly or not), some save game management would have been nice.\nAbout the secrets, different endings etc.: while it's great they are there, I still consider it bad design that the best ending requires you to omit certain unsuspicious actions without giving you _any_ hint.\nThere are also technical issues. Firstly, the (mandatory) scaling on widescreen monitors cuts of a good part of the upper and lower screen rendering the game unplayable since you can't see the tunnel at the bottom in the egg corridor. Forcing the game to run at 640x480 (through Win10 options) works, but stretches the display horizontally if your monitor can't compensate. For the original version, this might be discussable but for the reworked \"+\" version, this is just a No-Go. The game also crashed on me when I finished the machine gun challenge.\nLast but not least, there is the final boss fight (normal ending) which actually consists of three boss fights in three rooms without any possibility to save or restock. It's not totally surprising that only about 20% of players seem to have reached the normal or best ending of the game. Actually, I guess the percentage would be even much lower if this game attracted anybody else than people who actually like this kind of game. So 80% of players who like this kind of game failed to reach a proper ending. Hmm.\nSide note for the desperate: there's a file called profile.dat where the maximum and current life energy are stored at offsets 0x1C and 0x20 and the max/current rockets at offsets 0x58 and 0x5C.

Infused with humor, Cave Story perfectly balances platforming, exploration and (simple) combat -- with a great deal of variation in each aspect. That said, the difficulty curve can be a bit steep, and probably won't be very appealing to fans of more causal platformers. If you give Cave Story a chance, though, there's a lot to love here: it's one of those games you can return to again and again over the years and consistently discover something new or fresh about it that you'd never noticed before.\n\nNote: Also played don Nintendo 3DS.", "timestamp_created": 1585444442, "timestamp_updated": 1591416501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585026144981384277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66040274": {"recommendationid": "66040274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005991205", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 487, "last_played": 1531147591}, "language": "english", "review": "Played in original free version, came here to pay respect", "timestamp_created": 1585430111, "timestamp_updated": 1585430111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763910055160522461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66007100": {"recommendationid": "66007100", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988111637", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 449, "last_played": 1585395900}, "language": "english", "review": "Sort of like undertale only good", "timestamp_created": 1585398002, "timestamp_updated": 1585398002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492733180522918701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65969229": {"recommendationid": "65969229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302905501", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1578132725}, "language": "english", "review": "It's what happens when minecraft caves start to have a story", "timestamp_created": 1585350109, "timestamp_updated": 1585350109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488891720771789551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65802274": {"recommendationid": "65802274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066307391", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 155, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1700702601}, "language": "english", "review": "still running in hell to this day", "timestamp_created": 1585161177, "timestamp_updated": 1585161177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625676572322845459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65784316": {"recommendationid": "65784316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012620057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1541376864}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun brah, just get it.

You follow the adventures of a mysterious robot on his quest to save the rabbits from the evil Doctor. The story is fine, but not overly compelling, but the game play is great. You get a variety of unique weapons that are all upgradeable as you defeat enemies, but lose effectiveness as you take damage. This creates unique game play decisions, especially when confronting new enemies. I don't know how many times during a boss battle I would start with one gun which i preferred, got hit a few times, and then needed to switch guns due to leveling down after I take a hit. Fun mechanic that kept me on my toes! Finally, the graphics are very unique and the music is amazing.

Taking on the role of a bot suffering from amnesia, you explore a variety of small levels connected via the hub world. Within these levels, you utilize a handful of projectile weapons, which all feel great to use, and gun down, once again, a solid range of well-designed enemies.

Largely credited as the father of indie games because of it's massive success with a one-man dev team, Cave Story earned that title through its wondrous game design. It's incredibly replayable, enjoyable, and challenging, TLDR: Pick it up if you have the cash or scrounge for the freeware version. \nCave Story's gameplay is a combination of 2D-platforming and shooting, most easily comparable to the Metroid and Megaman series. The game offers roughly 10 different weapons to choose with, all of them changing drastically with every level up. Variety doesn't end with the guns because there are tons of distinct enemies and bosses to fight. Every fight in Cave Story is also a fair fight. If you die, it's your fault. Some of the maps are extremely challenging and satisfying to beat, like Hell, the Last Cave, and the boss gauntlet near the end of the game.  And those difficult levels aren't thrown at you immediately. Cave Story gives you plenty of time to learn the mechanics. Overall, it's best described as a difficult, yet satisfying 2D platformer/shooter.\nThe soundtrack is something to gush over. There are several marvelous chiptune songs to enjoy. The Balcony and Main Menu themes are some of my personal favorites. Just the joyous and upbeat nature of the soundtrack is enough to get me playing again. \nStory-wise, Cave Story's plot is simple while also complex enough to keep the player interested. I certainly wasn't expecting this cutesy pixelated game to have serious consequences and so many character deaths. You have to work your damn hardest to save one of the game's most iconic characters. There are numerous points where you can screw and get that character killed, but for the most part, it's something you can have the foresight to think about.\nMy only complaint about Cave Story involves the True Ending and an item called the 0.8 Booster. There's a point in the game where a character you know falls into a pit. 99% of players are going to jump in that pit to rescue him. If you decided to avoid the pit for some reason, the gap you have to jump over is massive, so it's still likely you'll fall in. If you fall in that pit and talk to that character, he dies and you lock yourself out of the true ending. What's even worse is that if you do that, you can't save a different character because an essential item just won't spawn. There is no connection to that item and the other character. You would have no idea the two were connected unless you looked it up. \nIn short, Cave Story was fantastic. With its phenomenal game design, an amazing soundtrack, and a decent story, it's certainly worth playing. Just keep in mind the stupid locks behind the True Ending.", "timestamp_created": 1579706229, "timestamp_updated": 1579706229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697495102882385254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62165942": {"recommendationid": "62165942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198966100856", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1615070814}, "language": "english", "review": "Looking back this was a strange choice for my middle school obsession, but almost a decade later this is still one of the very few platformers I like. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1579578807, "timestamp_updated": 1579578807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62165798": {"recommendationid": "62165798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192453933", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1587881541}, "language": "english", "review": "Great indie game with excellent platforming and diverse weaponry.

There is almost nothing that separates this version from the original which makes you wonder why it cost's a decent amount. You'd be better off downloading the original.

Lots of hidden upgrades, weapons, and upgrades for those weapons, and a unique levelling system for your guns that I can confidently say that I've never seen anywhere else.\n\nYou may be wondering why this review is negative, then. To answer that, I have one thing to say; Colourblindness.\n\nBeware if you buy this game and you have achromatopsia (Monochromatic Colourblindness) or any monochromatic variation of colourblindness. It will be unplayable. The Egg Corridor is alright; even if a few enemies do end up getting the jump on you or seemingly appear out of nowhere, you can still triumph with a bit of memorisation and random shooting. My main gripe comes from the aptly named \"Final Cave\". I've been told by a friend that it's all red enemies, with a black background and grey platforms. To me, and possibly to some of you, this cavern is a smudgy, blurry mess of platforms, some of which you can pass right through and more still that have deadly spikes attached to them.

The jumps, the travel time of your shots, and walking, all have an airy feeling to them that may make them feel as if they're lagging slightly. That being said, it barely impacts the experience, and by the end of the second level I was largely accustomed to the controls.

I don't really know why that is, but the characters never seem to acknowledge the main character's efforts at all, as if he never existed. So most of the time you just awkwardly stand there, as you watch the game play itself.  \n\nAnd now if I could describe the gameplay and platforming aspect in a sentence and you probably won't like the way I put it: I would call it a cheap version of Mega man and Metal Slug, with the floatiest controls I have ever experienced, I know it's dumb but Jesus, the way the main character jumps in this game, it's like he just floats upwards as if he's as light as a feather and then when he descends, he just flumps down extremely fast, as if he weighs as much as a school bus. In short, the controls are way too floaty, slippery and imprecise.\n\nI might have complained a lot in this review but all I wanted to do is point out that this game has flaws, but these flaws are just too prevalent to make this game an enjoyable one.

It's incredibly repetitive in that aspect, with the overly linear zones in the game (Most levels being almost completely horizontal. the second biggest problem is that It's not even a metroidvania, like everyone claims it is. What makes this NOT a metroidvania is that you gain abilities (as in weapons, powerups, etc that you can use to traverse, destroy, alter the environment or the enemies around you, or increase you agility in such a way that you can overcome obstacles, among other things.) the reason I can see that people say this is a metroidvania, is that you go back and forth in these incredibly linear levels, some of these levels being incredibly awkward to travel through, especially with your Zero-Gravity jump, which I feel like has an incredibly awkward Vertical-Horizontal distance ratio, feeling a bit unwieldy to use, especially during tight platforming sections, often with traps that instantly kill you.\n\nThis game's story and characters are really good though, especially the Mimigas and Curly, who are incredibly cute, I don't think the lore is deep but I do think that it is incredibly entertaining, if not a little generic. \n\nIf you're looking for a metroidvania, look elsewhere, this aint one. \nIf you're looking for a good story, look elsewhere as well.\nIf you're looking for a game where you can play as a cute robot.

There is always something new that you can find in the game to enhance your second, third, fourth playthrough and so on. The story is that of pure magic. There is no point in time that I wasn't submerged and there wasn't a time when my eyes were ever away from the screen. The story always found ways to throw you from your chair always being able to bring you back further into the gameplay than ever before. With items that change who you meet and who comes along with you.\n\n[h1] Gameplay\t[/h1]\nThe gameplay is also something to look at. There are different ways to use your weapons, and to upgrade them as the game goes on, and one of the best aspects of the game is that there are so many different weapons in the game. Even better there are other weapons hidden in all over the island that you are on. The enemies and the allies, all of them are fun to hang around, and try new strategies to getting around as the game progresses and as your hours grow.\n\n[h1] Bosses\t[/h1]\nThe bosses are sufficiently hard, and they will get you scratching your head at frustration at times, but beating them makes it all that more rewarding as the game goes on, and even better, you can find other ways to beat the bosses, which makes it really fun to play at multiple times. The bosses are fair in that remark and for the people that are saying it is a hard game to beat, I agree. But that\u2019s what makes it a fun game to sit down to and listen to something in the background.\n\n[h1] Art\t[/h1]\nThe art in the game is really comforting. Late at night it is easy on your eyes, and early in the morning, its also welcoming to a groggy person trying to one shot it in one day. The artistic-ness also leaves you wanting to get out your pc and make a game of your own. At some point I realized that you could screenshot it at any point in time you could screenshot it and make a really rememberable background, its that crisp with its pixels, and it doesn\u2019t leave you underwhelmed or anything of that sort.\n\n[h1] Closing thoughts\t[/h1]\nI highly recommend this came to anyone who sees past graphics being the spotlight for the game, as the atmosphere, and the gameplay brings new light to my eyes and always is a game that I end up buying on all the systems that it becomes available. At first it is something to put all your attention too, you will do some googling, and then you will find stuff that you may have never even knew existed before, and that makes it mysterious in a way. A good way that is.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Aspect[/th]\n        [th]Rating[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]10/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Art[/td]\n        [td]10/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Characters[/td]\n        [td]10/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]10/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Overall rating[/td]\n        [td]10/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1563308506, "timestamp_updated": 1563309640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54112032": {"recommendationid": "54112032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009528477", "num_games_owned": 1952, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1563125128}, "language": "english", "review": "Cave Story is a jump'n'run'n'gun in the sense of the \"Metroidvanias\" (albeit more linear) with Mario-like controls (your character does not instantly stop).

Glad we covered all the important parts!\n\nPROS: The story has a very 'lived in' feel to it.  Although you're important to the plot, you really drop in during the middle of things, leaving it to happen around you, rather than centered around you.  The metroidvania design of the game gives plenty of options for additional weapons and health, providing different ways to play, and the weapon level system gives more power and incentive to play without being hit to keep your weapons at their strongest.  The pixel art is very well designed, and charming to look at, and the soundtrack another wonderful touch, playing off the charming nature when needed, leaning to the creepy when used properly, and pumped up during the action pieces.\n\nCONS: The controls feel very floaty, leading to many untimely deaths while trying to get used to the particular platforming the game requires of you.  Some parts of the game can also feel a little disjointed, whether it be through the sudden and sharp dark twists in the story, or the puzzle aspects that can be a bit too out there for someone to just stumble across (looking at you, Machine Gun/Spur and Booster 0.8/2.0).  By far the worst is the jarring difficulty spike the game decides to fall into during it's last segment.  Yes, the final areas of the game should be the most difficult, but the way this game handles it borders over the extreme.  This is made even worse on the harder difficulties, where most enemies can kill you in a single hit.  The additional bonus stages don't feel like they add anything other than more difficulty for players, giving little desire to go for the best ending.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS: This is a mess.  Getting S Ranks on the extra stages is such a small and tight window, as is Hard Mode and the True Final Boss.  But, if you want to complete this list, you need to be able to go in and change the launcher's code, because it wasn't programmed properly.  Don't do this, and that Best Ending run becomes completely waste.\n\nFINAL: My feelings are quite mixed on this.  On the one hand, I love the game's design and story, but on the other, the odd decisions for better gear, sudden dark story turn, and ludicrous difficulty spike can leave a negative impact.

Even if you dislike platformers, if you like shooters (specially SHMUPS) you will love Cave Story. The powerup system, the boss fights and the bullet patterns you have to avoid, all of it screams SHOOTER all over the place\n\nYes, there is some \"rough edges\" on the level design every now and them (specially at the First Cave) and some of the weapons seem much more like an experimentation than something a \"professional\" dev would put in the final game. But this game was not made by a professional, it was made by a true amateur. And that's a good thing. Amateur, in French (from latin amator) means LOVER.\n\nYes, indeed... You can feel the love in each level and the love you feel playing seems to have been put there pixel by pixel by Pixel (pun intended). Cave Story was made by a passionate gamer, and it shows. This is one of the first games to pop my mind when I think about what \"indie\" means as aesthetics. \n\nBesides the fictional story, if you pay attention you can see a very true story, the story of how Cave Story came to be. There are some earlier enemies and traps that, in a \"normal\" game would be transformed in patterns that would permeate the entire game. That doesn't happen. Instead, a lot of stuff introduced on earlier stages are let there as if the author had decided that they were not such a good a idea. Again, in a \"normal\" game, this \"not that good\" ideas would be stripped off. Instead, they aquire meaning of its own. And that's really refreshing.\n\nIn game design, things are supposed to have meaning when considered as part of a whole. In Cave Story, many things are there on their own. But then again, that's good! Because they also get to have MEANING on their own (guardian of the graveyard, I'm looking at you).\n\nIt's pretty much like a large book where some character seems like will have an important part in the story, but them he somehow vanishes and you are let wondering if the writer had something planned and changed his mind. Afterwards, when you think about that great book, you always remember that character despite the fact that he wasn't so important to the story after all.\n\nThis collection of fragments comes together  so neatly that it could not be done by a group. Not like this. This is an authors game. The pieces inevitably come together because they come from the same mind. There's something that only happens when designer, programmer, writer and artist are the same person. An this something is what I like to call \"intent\". This game has intent. It craves to be a shooter and insists on being a platformer whilist being an RPG.

It is an enhanced edition (2011) of an old game, but looks even older than it really is. Although the original (Cave Story, without the +) was released in 2004 it looks like it is an original NES game. It currently sells at around 15 euro on Steam, which is quite a lot of money for such an old game, but I guess a lot of effort went into the remastered  2011 version. I think the game is worth the full price.\nThe game was created by just a single developer, which makes the quality of the game all the more remarkable. The graphics look great, the music is superb. The character controls very well which makes platforming a breeze. The level design, intricate storyline and nice atmosphere of the gamer are one of its best qualities. There are a variety of weapons, upgrades, enemies, and lots of good boss fights. But wait, there is more! The game features multiple play modes and a bunch of alternate endings.\nThe game is not perfect though. There is a little too much backtracking involved for my taste. And the English names of some characters don't go well with these characters and feel out of place with the Japanese names of most other charactersare, this issue is quite typical for Japanese games: for instance one of the bosses which looks like a fridge is called Balrog, and one of the bunnies is called King.

The Bushlands track was so bad with the \"new\" OST that I ended up turning the music off for the rest of the game.\nI don't like the art style, but that's personal opinion, obviously. I think it's a pretty ugly game, which I give slack to as it was made in 2004 by one person[?]. The remaster doesn't add much in that aspect though.\nThe gameplay really isn't anything to write home about. The whole game is rather easy on normal until the end, where the difficulty curve jumps like ten levels and makes you fight one of the most bullshit 4 phase bosses I've ever had the displeasure of battling, made EVEN WORSE on the true ending, where you have to complete a 3-5 minute obstacle course taking as little damage as possible and then battle a second, more bullshit 4 phase boss. And you have to redo the obstacle course every time you want another go at him. Every. Time.\nThe characters are bland and boring, most are just shitty little furries with nothing interesting to say. I saw that there was a better translation with more personality in another version of the game, but I didn't do any research into it, so I dunno more about it. You'd think a game named \"Cave Story\" would have a better story though.\n\nI know I've said nothing good about it, but I tentatively give this game a 4/10. It could definitely be worse than it is, and some parts are genuinely interesting and fun. You know, as long as you trade guns with Curly.

I'd like to preface this by making clear that I love playing games at the highest difficulties. It's the only way I can enjoy games at this point. Keep this in mind, because I played Cave Story at the highest difficulty. Also, I'd like to make clear that the gameplay itself wasn't annoying. It's the same reason why I loved They Bleed Pixels and other such games at their highest. It's difficult as hell, but I enjoy that. That's not where my complaints lie when it comes to Cave Story.\n\nWhat I've come to despise so greatly is the lack of proper game mechanics that would normally come as a prerequisite. Something that you'd usually take for granted; the ability to skip cutscenes. I hated this issue so damn much. I'm at the highest difficulty. I'm going to die countless times. So, why, for the love of all living things, must I have to physically keep mindlessly pressing buttons, for nearly a minute, mind you, before I can restart a boss fight? The only way I was able to make this remotely close to \"bearable\" was, by the supreme luck that I happened to own one, to use a gamepad with turbo functionality. Even then, every time you run the game anew, the game doesn't remember that you've watched this cutscene over twenty times already, and will default back to scrolling dialogue at a normal pace until you die for the \"first\" time, and only then, the scrolling is only marginally faster.\n\nAgain, I know I going to die countlessly. I understand this. I accept this. It's what makes it fun. Cave Story's dialogue sucked the fun right out of the room and left behind only tedium of demonic proportions. One of the things that makes something difficult, fun is the fact that once you fail, you have the option to get right back into the fight, right where you left off. Not Cave Story, though. It's like this; I own a kayak. I love kayaking. For a while, though, I didn't own a transportation rack for quick mounting to the roof of my car. I ended up just dropping this fun hobby until I bought one because of how much of a waste of time and energy it became to set it up. You had to bring this fifty-pound thing out to the car, put it on the roof, strap it down, double-check it's secure, drive to a lake, unstrap it, carry it off the car, put it in the water, tidy the straps and pack them in the car, then you're able to have fun in the kayak. Only except now you have to get back home. So, you have to drag the kayak back on top of your car, strap it down, drive off, unstrap it, pull it off the roof, pack the straps up, and drag it back up to the house. Wasn't that whole description just a pile of senseless monotony? Wouldn't it just be easier if you could just put it on the roof and go? That's this game. It doesn't have a roof rack. It's the definition of an inconvenience.\n\nAlso, you can't even restart in the same room you died in. You respawn at the save points. This normally wouldn't be such a problem, except for the fact that you die so often, and sometimes, the save location is a few screens away from your goal. Plus, for a game that uses bullet-hell mechanics, it uses pretty complex design. Your character will periodically bleed into the background and fall right out of your line of sight, especially if you're moving about quickly (otherwise known as the most inoportune time in the midst of a boss fight). Another funny quirk I've noticed is the lack of the ability to pause into settings. You have to exit the game you're playing first before you can access the main menu. It would also be pretty nice if you could lower the difficulty mid-game. You pick a difficulty, there's no going back. You gotta start a new game.\n\nI'm sure a lot of people will defend the developer in the way of mentioning that it was just a game quickly built as a hobby/passion project. You're absolutely right. At one point, this game sure was free, even. As it is now, though, it costs ~fifteen bucks, has developed a substantial fanbase, and is now over ten years old.. Update your god-damned game, pixel.\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n[BOTTOM LINE: tl;dr: hard game fun, un-skippable cutscenes bad. I'm sure these problems are all but superficial at lower difficulties, but this was my experience. Outside of all of that, though, it was a nice-looking game. I loved all of the character and world design. Somewhat of an interesting story, and certainly one I could become involved within. Sadly, though, I cannot bring myself to continue. I cannot bear to image how awful these problems become at later stages. Such a shame. I was really getting into it.]\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\n(Aside: I stopped playing at berserked Tokoro.

Mostly unlockable Game Challenges and Remastered music soundtrack, but you can also switch between different soundtracks(Original, New & Remastered) and graphics(Original & New) so you can choose the kind of mix that suits you while you play through the game and can be changed at any time in the main menu.\n\nI don't want to go much into the story to spoil anything for anyone who haven't played it at all, but all I can say it is very good overall, along with couple of fun secrets to discover when you least expect it.\n\nAs for the in-game achievements, there are the ones that are outragously difficult to obtain if you're achievement hunting(they are possible, but jeez!) also at the moment one achievment is broken and won't trigger, but can be fixed with help of a guide someone made in the community hub. Easy fix, but kinda silly this port of the game didn't get fixed with a simple fix like this. \n\nOverall, for this Steam port of Cave Story, it has greater(I even believe the best) amount of content you can get out of it. Certain things I feel could've gotten a proper polishing here and there(like the broken achievement I mentioned above), but nothing too serious that would make the game crash or anything like that(it doesn't).\nThe game can get REALLY difficult at certain parts, so make sure you really practice up your platform & shooting skills as you play!\n\nIf you've never played this indie platformer classic and looking for something that can pack some extra challenge and difficulty from time to time(especially as an achievement hunter) with a great story to follow with few multiple endings, then I can gladly recommend this one!", "timestamp_created": 1543248790, "timestamp_updated": 1543248790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584714651107788086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47039604": {"recommendationid": "47039604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058277587", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1543238196}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]Jump 'n Shoot Man+[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1543238169, "timestamp_updated": 1543238169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46898288": {"recommendationid": "46898288", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983225161", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 261, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1543139780}, "language": "english", "review": "The appaling saving ruins a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1543139911, "timestamp_updated": 1543139911, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.368387401103973389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46842716": {"recommendationid": "46842716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032006605", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 5152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1623202359}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best Indie games I have ever played.

To be fair, perhaps this was really good when it came out (2004). But now? It's just not that great.\n\nLet's start with the positives.\n\t\u2022 Fun/Strategic guns: The game has a lot of unique guns that are just flat out fun to use. Other guns are interesting simply because they are strategically useful in certain situations.\n\t\t\u25cb Bubbler: You hold the attack button to create a wall of bullets, useful for protecting yourself from weak enemies. Once you release the attack button, the bullets shoot out all at once, so it can be used like a shotgun for burst damage. I've never seen a gun like this before and it was really fun to use.\n\t\t\u25cb Fireball: This shoots tiny fireballs downwards and then the fireballs travel for a while before disappearing. The ability to shoot bullets downwards was useful in a lot of situations even right up until the end game.\n\t\t\u25cb Blade: This has very short range but if you hit an enemy it does a lot of damage and damages enemies in a decent radius for a lot of damage. This was useful for rooms where you couldn't snipe enemies from far away. It was also useful for enemies that had a lot of HP so it was dangerous to use the weaker guns while avoiding damage (since you would need to spend like 10 seconds avoiding the enemies' bullets while trying to kill them, whereas with this weapon they could die in like 2 seconds).\n\t\t\u25cb Machine Gun: This shoots a lot bullets that do decent damage. What's interesting about this weapon is that you can shoot downwards to allow you to hover for a long time (due to the \"recoil\" of the weapon). This is useful both for platforming and fighting enemies. \n\t\t\u25cb Spur: You can charge this weapon up to shoot a laser beam that does the most damage of any weapon, travels across the screen, and pierces enemies. This was fun to use simply because of how overpowered it was xD\n\t\u2022 Fun movement: Near the mid/end game, you get an ability to \"jetpack\" in any direction after you jump. This was surprisingly fun because you could go up, right, then up again. It's hard to explain, but the freedom of movement this ability provided was really awesome.\n\nNow onto the negatives:\n\t\u2022 Minimal exploration: This is a VERY barebones Metroid Vania. This is very much a stage based game that you follow in a linear format. Hell most of the stages are accessed from a computer in the \"Hub World\" that allows you to teleport to various places (i.e. the world isn't connected). The only reason it gets to be called a Metroid Vania is because there's some back-tracking near the end game in order to get the best weapon in the game. So wow you get to explore/backtrack ONCE.\n\t\u2022 EXP levels for guns: In this game, guns have EXP that you get from picking up EXP after killing enemies. Guns start at level 1 and max at 3. However, if you get damaged, guns lose EXP and they can de-level (i.e. you can go from 3-->2). What the hell was the point of this? I originally thought that the developer wanted to create difficulty by encouraging players to not get hit. However, at the mid/end game you get the Spur which can't be de-leveled. So in the most difficult part of the game, for all practical purposes the game throws this mechanic out the window. Therefore, it just creates an unnecessary grind to the early/mid game. If you get damaged, you need to waste time farming enemies for EXP to max out your gun again. It would've been so much better for these upgrades to be permanent and for them to be something players FIND (i.e. actually use the god-damn Metroid Vania tag). This would've been so much fun because when guns level up, it is VERY noticeable and makes a big difference. Ah well.\n\t\u2022 Endgame: The end game is so god damn bullshit. This game has 2 endings (well 3, but let's focus on the 2). In the first ending, the game ends at a certain point and everything is not all that hard and provides a fair level of challenge. However, in order to get the best ending, you need to go through a lot of bullshit. You need to go through a pain in the ass platforming section with a boss at the end (no checkpoints in between). Later on you need to fight 4 bosses in a row (no checkpoints in between). Lastly, you need to go through 3 platforming sections, the 2nd with enemies RANDOMLY spawning and pieces of the ceiling RANDOMLY falling on you, followed by a boss, followed by the last boss with 4 phases (no checkpoints in between). Noticing a pattern? The developer was incapable of creating an interesting boss that's difficult to beat, so instead he just decided to test the players' endurance by throwing as much as possible at you without giving you time to rest. Keep in mind that these platforming sections can take like 5-10 minutes to beat so you're waiting 5-10 minutes before facing the boss. This isn't a fun type of difficulty because when I beat the game, I wasn't going \"YES, I BEAT THAT SUNOFABICH\". I was going \"Phew, finally it's over\". \n\nThere's a story, but it's a classic good vs. evil type thing. Nothing special. I didn't care about any of the characters or what was going on or whatever.\n\nSo yea overall the game definitely had fun abilities and overall movement, so the game had a strong foundation. However, other areas such as exploration, annoying upgrade mechanic, and bullshit difficulty negatively impacted the experience. Like I said, above average game at best.

I've encountered a peculiar bug when playing this game, one that could potentially give this game a thumbs down. It's only happened to me on THIS game, never on any other game. I remapped my controls so that I could use the WASD keys to move and such, and for the first 5ish deaths or so, it seemed to be working just fine. However, I died on the Egg Corridor stage (or whatever it's called, the first area after you teleport into after you get out of the starting area) and when I died, my controls went back to arrow keys. Thinking this was weird, I tried remapping them back to WASD again. Turns out the game can remap your WASD and arrow keys and swap them. Your keys remain swapped until you unplug and replug your keyboard back in.\n\nI have not been able to recreate this so far, and I have not found out what causes this or what the solution is. I can only hope the devs that published the steam release of this game read this and fix it. It might be a minor inconvenience, but I think it really hurts this game, even though it could be a masterpiece. For now, I recommend just using a controller instead of trying to remap your keys, at least until this gets a patch.

En esencia hay que salir de esta cueva, pero muy temprano somos transportados a una aventura que crece y se desarrolla tanto como las cuevas que se descubren, encontrando nuevos enemigos, nuevos aliados, y un mont\u00f3n de secretos que descubrir, y donde todo al final vale la pena sin importar la dificultad y longevidad del juego.\n\nEsta versi\u00f3n es la segunda remasterizaci\u00f3n del t\u00edtulo indie del mismo nombre, en esta versi\u00f3n se incluye todo lo de la primera remasterizaci\u00f3n adem\u00e1s de un Nivel Extra para los que buscan la historia m\u00e1s completa (y M\u00c1S dif\u00edcil!), tambi\u00e9n incluye un modo especial para jugar con otro personaje, y varios desaf\u00edos adicionales con oportunidad de grabarlos para compartir el mejor tiempo con todos los jugadores del mundo.\n\nTodo lo que tiene este juego es grandioso! Los gr\u00e1ficos \"Pixel\" art tienen un mont\u00f3n de detalles muy bien dibujados, la m\u00fasica y sonido sacan todo su potencial (y para los jugadores de la primera versi\u00f3n: el Soundtrack original est\u00e1 incluido!), y la dificultad es desafiante sin ser demasiado injusta, con m\u00faltiples opciones para los diferentes tipos de jugador.\n\nPero el mejor punto para m\u00ed es la Historia, simplemente es la mejor parte del juego: aventura, comedia, drama, suspenso, algo de terror, todo se re\u00fane en la que puede ser una de las mejores historias, no solamente de los indies, sino de todos los videojuegos de todos los tiempos! Todo esto creado por una sola mente, y al igual que ZUN, Toby Fox, Studio MDHR, y otros tantos genios independientes que han dado sus historias a conocer con todo su esfuerzo, el mundo de los videojuegos del futuro ahora les pertenece a ellos!\n\nSin m\u00e1s que decir, recomiendo este juego para los amantes de los Metroidvania, de los juegos indie, de las buenas historias, de los plataformeros...Este juego no los decepcionar\u00e1 nunca, ni aunque caigan miles de veces!", "timestamp_created": 1536470818, "timestamp_updated": 1542863855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44590785": {"recommendationid": "44590785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043569762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 915, "last_played": 1358841600}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, the story of the original Cave Story's development and impact are even more so.", "timestamp_created": 1536187514, "timestamp_updated": 1536187514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44582597": {"recommendationid": "44582597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277785733", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 877, "last_played": 1570497292}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever.\nBest music.\nBest story.\nBest worlds.\nBest.", "timestamp_created": 1536154463, "timestamp_updated": 1536154463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.672735333442687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44452065": {"recommendationid": "44452065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066860699", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1638767007}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the third time ive bought this game and it still doesn't dissapoint. it been 6 years from when I first beat the game and im still finding out about this game. 20/10 My fav game", "timestamp_created": 1535578208, "timestamp_updated": 1535578208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44449095": {"recommendationid": "44449095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215337317", "num_games_owned": 534, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 475, "last_played": 1561729929}, "language": "english", "review": "The original one released in 2004 (CMIIW) for PC and it was free (you can get it for free in here https://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php)\n\nBefore you buy this game, make sure you already played the original one or you can buy this game BUT, think twice before you give thumbs down in the review section\n\nOk so, this version of Cave Story is the remake from the original one with HD Graphic of course.

Game #59\n\nIt has been well over a month since my last review. The reason for this is \u2026 that I\u2019ve become a father. Yeah, apparently, after you become a parent you have less time for games. Who would have thought? \n\n[h1] I can't believe I haven't played this game earlier [/h1]\n\nThe sad thing is that Cave Story isn\u2019t even that long of a game and it shouldn\u2019t have taken me more than a few days to beat. Finally, after a month not even turning on steam, turning on steam and running to the baby\u2019s room, actually booting \u201cCave Story\u201d but running to the baby\u2019s room because she was crying and, very rarely, actually playing \u201cCave Story\u201d, I was able to finish this little game.\n\nCave Story is a sweet little game. When it first came out, I remember it being called \u201cThe best Super Nintendo game never released\u201d. Cave Story certainly looks like a Super Nintendo game boasting a nice 2D platformer with 16 bit graphics as well as some 16 bit music. \n\nNow, when I heard the term Super Nintendo game, I thought about a platformer, not a particularly long one, with some nice music, creative enemies and a lot of jumping. Cave Story is all that and much more.\n\n[h1] Save the cute little bunnies from the evil doctor [/h1]\n\nCave Story takes place in a *GASP* cave\u2026 that\u2019s floating on an island??? Whatever, it\u2019s not really important. What is important is what is actually going inside this floating island cave. You arrive as a robot with a wiped out memory on to the island and immediately the bunny like creatures that inhabit this island start avoiding you. You quickly learn that the Bunny creatures, known as the Mimiga, have been slaughtered in the past by killer robots like the one you are playing as. Seeing how you don\u2019t feel the urge to slaughter the poor innocent bunnies, you decide to help them.\n\nWhat follows is a surprisingly well made and a bit dark story. The bunny people start getting kidnapped by a man known only as \u201cThe Doctor\u201d who wishes to use them in his evil experiments. He does this by making them eat red flowers which makes them go berserk. You, along with a few friendly NPCs must save the Mimiga race from the evil Doctor. While my description isn\u2019t doing the story any justice, it is surprisingly well written, especially for what appears to be a Super Nintendo game.\n\n[h1] Great controls [/h1]\n\nBut SNES games were never much about the story, right? What is the gameplay like? How is the jumping? How are the weapons? Well, I am happy to say that everything is just fine \u2018n\u2019 dandy.\n\nJumping and platforming feels responsive. It took me very little to get used to the momentum and the jumping and I generally didn\u2019t have too many problems moving my character around. There are quite a few death traps that can kill you instantly during your platforming endeavors, however, the game hosts a generous amount of save points so most deaths shouldn\u2019t lead to too much frustration.\n\n[h1] The weapon system is phenomenal [/h1]\n\nWhat\u2019s really awesome about this game are its weapons and the weapon progression system. Since you are an ex-killer-robot, you are able to use a variety of firearms. Each weapon you collect can be leveled up three times. The higher the level, the more damage you do (DUH!). At first it seemed really easy to level up weapons and I thought that the system was broken, but then I started getting hit by some enemies and I realized that my weapon was losing experience. While this seems frustrating, it\u2019s incredibly fun and challenging the level up your weapons and keep them from down-leveling. You start playing the game more carefully and carefully considering many upcoming moves that you make because not only does taking damage cost you precious hit points, but it might also cause your weapon to power down. Again, don\u2019t be intimidated by this weapon system. It works great and more importantly, it\u2019s a lot of fun. \n\nSpeaking of weapons, you will be using them to kill a bunch of enemies. There are quite a few types of enemies in this game. Most of them are cute creatures like frogs, slimes, bugs, skeletons, etc. Each zone in the game has its own enemies and its own boss. Boss fights can seem intimidating but they are all about picking the correct weapon and not getting hit. If you throw yourself at a boss you will be left with little health and downgraded weapons which will make the fight a lot harder than it needs to be. If you instead tread carefully and fire when the boss is exposed, you will be able to win easily most boss fights. Seriously, I cannot praise the weapon system enough.\n\n[h1] I guess it's a metroidvania but it's mostly just liner progression... and there is nothing wrong with that [/h1]\n\nCave Story, by definition, plays like a Metroidvania styled game, but I would disagree with that\u2026 at least a little bit. While you can go back to the zones you previously visited and while there are power ups (both weapon, health and missiles), backtracking in this game is kept to a minimum. Only once did I need to backtrack and only once did I get lost without knowing where to go next. Other than that, the game more or less plays like a linear 2D platformer, which is fine as well. What I am trying to say is: while this game is TECHNICALLY a Metroidvania game, you will play it in a very linear way.\n\n[h1] Really catchy music [/h1]\n\nThe music is just amazing. The title theme is very catchy and the rest of the music is just great. Not once during my entire play through did I find a level theme I didn\u2019t like and considering that the game uses 16 bit music, this is a very impressive feat.\n\n[h1] A great game [/h1]\n\nMy only regret is that I never was able to finish this game up until now because Cave Story is a fantastic game. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s short, it was made by just one guy and it\u2019s a lot of fun. If you enjoy 2D platformers or metroidvania games, you will have a great time with Cave Story.\n\nNow I wonder if it will take me another month to finish playing my next game.\n\nNext game: Chivalry: Medieval Warfare\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075061111/recommended/219640/\n\n[h3]If you liked my review, feel free to follow my curator group.

Unaware of the situation the robot begins to explore his surroundings and soon meets the Mimigas, a rabbit/bunny species, that are trying to stop the doctor and his minions from taking over the world with the power of the red flowers.\n\n\nCave Story is a platform-adventure that requires you to use the right weapon for the right occasion. Weapons can vary from a peashooter, a missile launcher or a bubble gun that seems silly but when it reaches level three then it can perform some good damage over time. By killing enemies and certain bosses they will drop these yellow triangles which are experience points to level up your guns. Just be careful, because if you get hit then your guns lose experience points. Enemies can also vary from different types, from the flying insects that swarm you or bouncing blobs that try to jump and\nbutt stomp you or shoot small projectiles.\n\nThroughout the game, you will find life upgrades and missiles upgrades to increase your survivability chance, these upgrades can be found tucked away in certain areas. It helps to explore the area and get everything you can get. Although experienced players don\u2019t necessarily need to get everything as the game can be relatively a smooth pass till end game. Newcomers are recommended to get every health and missile upgrade as the end game can be tough for casual players. Some enemies become speedy and hard to hit while dealing a substantial amount of damage. As well the extra obstacles that can be in the player\u2019s way. If you are having an issue with your guns losing a lot of experience points, then try to find the arms bearer as it halves the experience loss from your guns. \n\nIf you find the loss of health too much, then try replaying the game on an easier difficulty. Easy mode is great for newcomers to the platform-adventure genre, but experienced players should give normal mode a try as it is a good challenge. Hard mode is recommended for hardcore players as you go throughout the game with only three hit points and you lose access to the missile launcher; by end game, you can find a life upgrade to boost your health to a maximum of eight.\n\n\nMy first experience with Cave Story was back when homebrewing the Wii was popular and one of the games I got was Cave Story. I enjoyed every aspect of exploring and finding goodies, defeating enemies in pulse-racing battles, and the joyful and emotional music tracks. Each location is straightforward and simple that your path is mostly linear, you can get a map system early on which reveals the map of the area, but I never used it since the areas were so small and straightforward. I played on easy mode for the Steam achievements and switched to normal mood for a fun adventure. Hard mode was challenging since you take double damage and with not a lot of health, you are basically a one-hit-wonder. The game is also short even if you go for 100% but the game does offer different challenges and a chance to play as another character. With different things to do you can put in twelve to fourteen hours into this game if you are dedicated to doing everything.\n\n\nRating (out of 10) -\n[list]\n[*]Graphics: 8\n- If you played the original version of Cave Story, then these upgrades are an enhancement. Better lighting and more colors really make this game vivid.\n\n[*]Music: 7\n- I preached earlier about the music but it\u2019s nothing that I will hum or anything. It\u2019s nice on the ears but not memorable with exceptions of the soundtrack for that plays during the menu screen and the final boss theme.\n\n[*]Story: 4\n- The story felt vague, while simple, there was a lot of plot holes and things that we never got context about. It feels like Cave Story+ could have been a sequel that is filling in those plot holes, but since that\u2019s not the case then the story just feels vague.\n\n[*]Content: 8\n- The controls are simple with one button to shoot, one or two buttons to switch weapons, joystick or control pad to move, and the same joystick or control pad to interact with things. Shooting in any cardinal direction wasn\u2019t bad at all but your character\u2019s jump does feel floaty which could make some tight platforming difficult.\n\n[*]Gameplay: 9\n- I love games that make feel like I\u2019m in a tense situation with many do or die moments. Cave Story+ fulfills that and my sense of exploration. Strategies to defeat enemies, platforming challenge and challenging boss battles make this game fun!\n[/list]\n\n\nCave Story+ is a great game for those who are new to the platform-adventure genre. It will teach you things about exploring and strategizing in positioning your character with the right weapons to deal with any obstacle in your way. Despite the added features, I do feel the game could be better at $12 price tag for $14.99 it's not a bad deal.", "timestamp_created": 1533787311, "timestamp_updated": 1533787480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618461847305297852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44011367": {"recommendationid": "44011367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012774082", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 767, "last_played": 1380502633}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2665", "timestamp_created": 1533781554, "timestamp_updated": 1533781554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43990247": {"recommendationid": "43990247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410352975", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 519, "last_played": 1513477911}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bastante entretenido, gran banda sonora, buenas mecanicas, todo un clasico de los indies, recomendadisimo si te gustan los Metroidvania, si no es tu genero favorito pero te gusta un buen jugo para pasar el rato solo espera una oferta", "timestamp_created": 1533679234, "timestamp_updated": 1533679234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43930090": {"recommendationid": "43930090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004372851", "num_games_owned": 736, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 2382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1428, "last_played": 1691518937}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just phenominal.

Starting off, you have to go through a boss fight that is easily one of the two hardest in the game up to that point.  Afterwards, you have to fight two different forms of a different boss.  THEN, you have to fight another boss, while dealing with two different powerful enemies simultaneously.  This fight, in particular, is a nightmare of moving platforms and swarms of monsters.  It was as far as I got, and I only managed to chip off a little of the boss's health before dying.\n\n     None of these fights had a save point after them, which I consider inexcusable.   Up until this point, the game's difficulty had been pretty sensible, and as far as I can recall, you only ever fought one boss at a time before getting another save.  Even the final level before this boss gauntlet, which was obviously meant to be challenging, only took me an hour at most.  The subsequent fights, on the other hand, I've spent hours on, and made little progress in fully beating.  Cave Story absolutely does not prepare you, in any way, for the level of difficulty that comes with these final bosses.\n\n     The fights would absolutely be beatable for if there had been savepoints in between, which again, is how it works for the entirety of the game up to that point.  Giving the player multiple challenging boss fights, with no intervening chance to save, is the kind of offense not even a modern bastion of hard gaming like Dark Souls would commit,  and for most of its playtime, this game is not Dark Souls. \n\n     And on top of all that, I looked up the ending, and it turns out that after those four fights, there's ANOTHER challenge before the ending, still with no savepoint.  [b] In the ending of this game, it is possible to beat four different bosses, before getting hit on the head with a rock, and having to start all over. [/b]\n\n     I imagine to a certain stripe of gaming masochist out there, this all sounds just great, but again, THIS CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.  Most of the game is not like this.

This game will always be special to me. I've first discovered it over 10 years ago and played it day and night back in 2008 to figure out all the endings and how to get to the seceret final area...Hell. I was so young back then and I didn't think about looking it up on google lol, but eventually I figured it out. Playing this again was by far the most nostalgic experience I had in a long time, I'll never forget this game. Ok now time to focus on the game itsself: Cave Story was origianlly created by Studio Pixel back in 2004, later this remaster came out on steam in 2011. This remaster is pretty good, the graphic's are redone really well and looks great without ruinning the original style. The music is also redone in two ways: New or remastered. I prefer the original over the new ones however the remastered music is great and I prefer the remastered over the new and original. One other thing that's been changed in the remaster is the dialeuge and the naming, Balrog says \"Huzaah!\" in the original and not \"Oh Yeeah\" and also it's \"Grasstown\" not \"Bushlands\" etc... That's not all the remaster has to offer, It also has different modes and challenges like the Machinegun Challenge or the Boss Challenge wich are pretty alright I'd say. Then there is Curly Story that's kinda stupid; you basically play the whole story mode as Curly Brace, a girl you later on will meet in the normal story mode. There is a little bit extra dialouge in Curly Story but really not much, you're not missing out on anything by not playing that mode. The whole story takes place on a island floating in the sky. It starts with you waking up in a cave and you can't remember anything. You are a robot that was meant to fight a war on earth. [spoiler] Later you find yourself in a place called Mimiga Village where the creatures called Mimiga lives. Mimiga can be turned into raging killing machines if they eat a substance called \"Red Flowers\". The main antagonist wants to use the Red Flowers to create an army of Mimiga to attack the surface. [/spoiler] That's a very basic summary of the story I'm not telling the whole thing. Wheather you are completely new to the game or know it for a long time like me, I recommend it to anyone. I had lots of fun playing! The gameplay is great and the story is excellent! One more thing, you don't need to buy the remaster to get the full experience, you can also just download the original 2004 version from the site www.cavestory.org you'll have to download and install the English Translation patch too because the original game is in Japanese, but it's easy to do it and it still works perfectly with windows 10. Keep in mind that the original is only the story, you don't get all the new modes, challenges and of course the new graphics and soundtracks.", "timestamp_created": 1531086945, "timestamp_updated": 1531343023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43391626": {"recommendationid": "43391626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188783298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1497327522}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this game had a lot of potential, but I personally hit a wall pretty early on in the game.

The interesting thing about the story of this game is that you kind of walk into the middle of it in the game, and figure out what's going on as it's already well underway. Without spoiling anything, essentially an evil scientist is kidnapping people from a village of peaceful Mimigas(Cute little bunny people) with the help of an evil witch Mimiga, and a large box man, presumably for the purposes of some evil scheme.\nAs time goes on, the characters in the story talk about what's going on, and you find out more and more about what exactly is happening in this world, what the mad doctor's evil scheme is, and why you have to stop him.\nThe characters are endearing, and ultimately, the story really rides on the strength of the subtleties of these characters; pretty much all the principle players have something interesting about them to learn, which gives a greater context for the current events happening in the game.\n\nSo, you've got kick-ass platforming gameplay, a really charming story with a lot of depth of character to dig into, some awesome music, and the art is really great. This is already the makings of a classic, but there's more.\n\nThe thing about Cave Story is that when I first played it, there were a few small turns the story took in the second half that I didn't like much, and I thought could have been handled better. Then, I found out about the alternate ending. Essentially, if you don't get the jetpack, and then before fighting the boss immediately after the opportunity to get the jetpack, you go into the boss area, and pick up the \"Tow rope\" item, you trigger a sidequest you pick up on at a couple of points in the game, which ultimately leads to a small hut you walk past just after you've beaten the final boss being open. Inside this hut, you gain access to one final level, which is ridiculously hard, but if you can beat it, you see the alternate \"True ending\". It took me about a week and a half of solidly playing that and not doing anything else to get through it, but I don't regret a single second of it; it was a really cool final \"ridiculously hard gauntlet to prove you're worthy of the real ending\" section to send the game off with, and the ending it leads to is far more satisfying than the standard ending, which ties up all the loose ends, and leaves me with nothing really left to say against it...\n\nWell... Actually, there are a few things to say against it.\n\nFirst off, there's a boss in the Labyrinth where the last checkpoint before it is a good few minutes away from the boss himself, and it's one of the harder bosses in the game, so not only do you have to go all the way back to that checkpoint every time you die, but it's incredibly easy to get hit by enemies on the way, and face the boss while only at half health, or less.\n\nSecond, the secret area you have to beat at the end of the alternate ending has one element to it that carries it over from challenging to needlessly obtuse; any time you die in any of the 5 rooms it covers(Including a boss and a mini-boss), you start from the beginning of room 1, and if you happened to be hit by any boxes or anything on your way out to it from the final boss of the standard run, there's no hearts to restore your health until the end of room 2.\nI like the fact that the final level is so hard, and I enjoyed trying repeatedly to defeat it, but having to run the entire gauntlet over and over again from the start any time I made a mistake just barely big enough to get me killed(Which isn't hard in this gauntlet; there are a good few instant death pits, and both of the bosses are incredibly difficult) is just needlessly obtuse.\n\nAnd finally, the way you trigger the alternate ending initially is very obtuse, and I have no idea how anyone is supposed to figure it out without looking it up. There's a section where you see someone fall down a bit that appears to be an impossible jump, which it seems you're supposed to fail to cross and fall down. If you talk to the person who fell, they give you a jetpack, allowing you to get across. Thing is, the jump isn't impossible, and if you time your jump such that you jump just as your character is over a tiny little red marker that you'd never notice unless you randomly decided to wait around in that section for no reason and examine the floor, you can make it over. But, then you have to go into the boss area, walk all the way to the back of it, and pick up an item that's now there thanks to you not getting the jetpack. Then, after you've defeated the boss, you have to use the item, and make your way to a little hut, which is very easy to not get to, as it requires you to jump over a gap that's forcing you across and down into it. There's a couple of yes/no options during this process where effectively one choice can render the whole effort moot, while the other allows the thing to progress(If you're reading this as a guide on how to get the secret ending, and you want me to be a bit more specific, in order to get the secret ending, you have to not leave, and then take it with you). Unless you read an online guide, I have no idea how in the hell you're supposed to know how to do that.\n\nBut, that really is it. Three points of frustration I have with it are the only real criticisms I hold against it. I even give that third one some slack due to the fact it stops you from going for the secret ending your first time around(Which is a VERY bad idea. First time around, there's no way you'll be ready for the secret ending). And that's something in general that's pretty neat about the game; your first time around, you'll probably make some non-optimal choices that make the game more suited to the first play-through of a beginner, then the next time you play through, you'll probably do things a little better(For example: Don't get the machine gun, go for the secret ending, get a couple of the secret weapons like the Snake and the Nemesis), though don't feel bad if you can't beat the secret ending on your second, or even third, playthrough.\nIf you want my advice, on your third playthrough, try to find the secret that trades you the Spur weapon instead of the Polar Star, machine gun, or Snake, get the Whimsical Star secret upgrade for it that replaced the Snake weapon trade, seek out and get every health upgrade(Don't be ashamed of looking them up online if you missed one or two, but do give it the old college try before resorting to that), and don't get the Nemesis weapon. With that, you should be basically optimal. Aside from that, the only advice I can offer is to read the Steam guides on how to beat the secret ending, and watch some speedruns and such; you can find some rather helpful little tricks in those that you may not be able to figure out for yourself.\n\nBut anyway, ultimately, this is a really great game, and as you can tell from how much I've written about this while barely scratching the surface, there's a lot of depth to it. And despite the fact there are definitely things I will openly critcise about it, I love this game to bits, and consider it my favourite game of all time.\nSo, check this one out, you'll probably have a really fun time with it.", "timestamp_created": 1529730963, "timestamp_updated": 1529730963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736129343509674072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42940897": {"recommendationid": "42940897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271603537", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1547966960}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the original version and it's good.

This character in question is himself amnesic and does not remember his past. During his quest, he will meet mimigas (rabbits) and other humans, as well as a rather comical rival named Balrog. He later discovered that he was ultimately just a simple surface war robot that had been created by other humans.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nCave Story takes exactly all the possible bases of metroidevania: run, jump, shoot, fly, as its description indicates. The highlight of this game is the variety of weapon levels, and improvements to have.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\n\nThis game takes exactly the good old graphics of the snes. There is nothing to say, especially since you can play with the graphics of the game retouched OR the original (which is basic free). For an independent company, I only want to say one thing: a nice bravo to the entire team. :)\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10\n\nThe music and sounds created by Studio Pixel are quite good. It's hard to say that the soundtrack is horrible, since all the music goes well with the mood of the stage. Frankly, I listen to them even sometimes on youtube.\n\nSummary: 96/100\n\nCave Story is for me THE metroivania that has never been released (especially since the game dates from over 13 years ago to date, and the remastered 7.

It delivers an admittedly short but warm-hearted story, the variety in the few weapons you get are decent, and the bosses have enough diversity to not feel rinsed and repeated. The platforming is pretty slippery, like some of the retro games it's emulating, which might be a draw for some people but could make certain sections feel like a chore for others.\n\nAt the end of the day, this platformer just kind of lost me.

Its visual design is both unique and charming; its gunplay is enjoyable with some rather engaging boss fights; its story is simple yet engaging with a colorful cast of characters; all the while featuring a wonderfully-composed soundtrack.\n\nBut I still can't recommend it.\n\nI wanted to like this game. I really did. I was genuinely having fun with it very early on. Unfortunately, there's a lot of minor design decisions that are so numerous and significant they broke the experience for me.\n\nFor starters, some of the levels expect a lot of back and forth from the player, imposed through arbitrary mechanical limitations that don't make a lot of sense (why can you only carry one jam jar?). This normally wouldn't be an issue if the level design was good enough, which sadly isn't the case. I'd even go out of my way to say the level design is horrendous. Now Cave Story doesn't have the tightest platforming; the main character jumps far too high to be able to effectively judge where he'll land, and he maintains enough momentum to slip off ledges after landing, even if the player isn't pushing a certain direction. This is only made worse by how the game expects quite a lot of precise platforming to maneuver around, with usually only one way to climb up and reach the series of tiles you need to jump across. If you miss a jump, you have to go back to the very beginning of the queue, and some of these do stretch quite far.\n\nIt doesn't help that the game respawns enemies all the time, and considering how vital it is to avoid getting hit in order to maintain your weapons' efficiency, you'll often be locked into fighting these enemies again every time you want to cross, back and forth. There's also no efficient shortcuts to unlock after traversing certain areas, and all this does is add to the tedium when better time could be spent on either more interesting things or making the game shorter (which I'll get into why it needed this later). The game also really likes setting instant-death traps, and although save points aren't too far apart, everything else I explained makes them feel like they are, so any accidental slip off the edge because of the game's awkward platforming can be pretty frustrating. Usually these instant-death traps wouldn't be a big deal if the player could traverse screens quickly and efficiently; a prime example of that being implemented well from recent memory being in Shovel Knight, which also has a robust enough platforming system where deaths often do not feel cheap.\n\nThings escalated to a point that I had to traverse a location in the game back and forth five times and once more forwards at minimum because I could only carry one dog at a time, with the sixth time forwards being so as to cross over to the next objective. It's kind of a shame because there are a couple of points in the game where the level design is honestly clever, but so much of it is ignored by the sheer volume of bizarre designs in a majority of the game.\n\nAnother big issue comes in the form of how the game is structured towards the end. It's often recommended for new players to go with either the bad or neutral ending first, with the good ending being reserved for second-time players or veterans. What determines the ending you end up with all happens around the end of the second act of the game. If you do want to go for the true ending, there are a lot of choices you need to make, some of which could be a little arbitrary that would require the player to read some sort of walkthrough, or be physically difficult to do. It doesn't help that picking the true ending makes the game significantly more challenging, and sadly the cheap kind of challenging. The worst being in [spoiler]Final Cave where for some arbitrary reason, you lose all the chips you accumulated for your guns, bringing them all back to LV1, meaning that you either have to farm the local enemies to get them back up, or you try to get past that stage the way you are, and it is not easy especially with the sudden difficulty spike where you now have to platform using a jetpack (that can be clunky to use especially if you need to fly and shoot in two different directions). The game additionally adds an extra boss that is genuinely fun as it is tough considering that level, but unfortunately leaves a hidden instant-death trap immediately after the combat arena that.[/spoiler] It was here where I just gave up; I had so many other games to play, and having to throw myself at a part of a game that feels unsatisfying and cheap was not worth it. I also hear that the true ending [spoiler]adds an incredibly optional yet challenging boss fight[/spoiler] past that point which I would have loved to have thrown myself at but sadly I won't get the chance to do so.\n\nNone of this would have mattered as much as it did if the game had a robust save system. It doesn't sadly. You get three save slots, and you're locked to the save slot you chose for the entirety of the run. In a game where you could easily mess up your choices, being given the option to handle multiple save slots would mean you could skip a lot of the early tedium and jump right to the branching decision in order to progress towards the different endings after completing a playthrough, without having to replay the entire game from scratch, through a lot of the annoying platforming. Heck, if this game was much shorter and the more tiresome aspects that are there to extend playtime were removed, I would have been totally fine with replaying the game from the beginning each time.\n\nAlthough I did praise the bosses in this game, some of them feel a little too easy simply because their patterns were far too predictable. I suppose it really shows how this was originally a free indie game from 2004.\n\nIn conclusion, Cave Story+ has a lot of good going for it, but so many tiny little design details can easily turn people off, and sadly I was one of those people. Although I do appreciate the upgrades this version brings, it still desparately needed more for some of its gameplay issues, which is apparently the case for Cave Story++ on the Nintendo Switch. Maybe that version fixes a majority of my complaints and that would be the one to get, but I can't say for sure.

And theres so many ports and iterations of it that it's just like wow, look at this. This was an indie game before indies were a thing. One guy made this game and it blew up to be one of the best games in an action platformer style game.\n\nStory is fairly simple but very very complex at the same time, and I really can't talk about this because I really don't want to slip, go into spoiler territory and mess it up for anyone new to this game. But just trust me when I say this story makes it worth the trouble and difficulty this game gives you (unless you're playing on easy, like me. (and even then getting the best/true ending will be tough for you! I've yet to get it even though I know what happens.)\n\nGameplay is floaty but DEFINITELY POLISHED. It reminds me of a mix of OG Megaman and NES Metroid (Nestroid as people like to call it) and it definitely shows in different aspects. You explore like Metroid, you get weapons that are kinda like how weapons work in Megaman- But I digress, this is its own thing and it really deserves recognition of being its own thing.\n\nAnyway I really don't want to talk much more about this game because I'm afraid of spoiling it so how about you do like I did, take the word of a stranger and give this game a try! You won't be disappointed (ESPECIALLY if its on sale!!!!!)\n\nMy rating is: 8/10\nThis is by far not a perfect game... BUT I will explain why I don't give it a 9/10 because I really love it.\nThe Switch version is actually a bit better and hope they patch the PC version soon with the additions it has such as 2 new soundtracks to play with, new challenges in the challenge mini game thing, face portraits actually blink and move and talk n whatnot, and if you find a first run of it physically you get an actual full color manual, a sound track CD with some of the tracks from the first of 2 new sound tracks, the Famitrack! Oh and did I mention you could also get either a Main Character keychain, a Curly keychain or a Balrog keychain? (I got Balrog. Aw, I wanted Curly. Oh well! Still cool.) and Cave Story 3D actaully shows what this game could become if made using modern ...I guess graphics? Not sure how to explain this but it uses models and polygons instead of sprites n whatnot. That is a fun game too.\n\nBut anyway, this version is the closest to the complete version you can find and I'm sure it'll be updated with the Cave Story+content that the Switch got because this is the PC version after all. \n\nAlso quick note: If you want to try this out before buying it you could actually find this for free from Pixel aka Daisuke Amaya. The thing is that Cave Story on Steam has a \"+\" for a reason and it has more content, is more polished and clean, etc. But yeah, I figure I'd put that out for anyone who wants to try it first as a sort of demo.", "timestamp_created": 1522713166, "timestamp_updated": 1522713166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41219617": {"recommendationid": "41219617", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970880630", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 405, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1522639166}, "language": "english", "review": "Backlog review, just getting to Cave Story+, gonna steal another review, Love the retro art and music, but, game is very underwhelming.

The game is short enough to do a full run in one sitting whenever you feel bored and want some old school action. Each playthrough can be very different depending on what choices you make throughout the game. There are multiple difficulty modes, mutually exclusive weapon loadouts, secret and alternative levels and bosses.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some questionable design decisions. The cutscenes are not only unskippable but you have to press and hold a button to manually advance through every sentence being said. Some of the backtracking is really tedious and breaks the pace of the game. The checkpoint starvation becomes less of a problem as you \"git gud\" at the game but can still feel a bit too punishing if you accidentally slip up and have to redo the whole level from scratch.\n\nThe Steam version is only slightly better than the original freeware release. It includes 2x upscaled graphics, 2 remixed soundtracks, some extra levels to play outside of the main story and quite a few achievements to collect. Unfortunately it doesn't support widescreen or any aspect ratio other than the original 4:3. If you want to play Cave Story in 16:9 I'd recommend getting either the open source version (NXEngine-evo) or the PSP port (through the PPSSPP emulator).

It is a challenging and rewarding game. But I have to add the caveat that you should use a guide. Not to make the game easier, but because the \"best ending\" would be almost impossible to get without being told where to go at what times.\n\nLonger version:\nThis game starts out fine. Tight controls, okay platforming, decent weapons, quirky world, and one of the most important things, it forces you to get better at it. It becomes more challenging at a relatively acceptable pace.\n\nThe first big problem comes at the start of the second level (the desert one). You can switch your main weapon for a machine gun. It wasn't very long before I realised that when upgraded fully, the machine gun can propel you into the air. [b]This is a major problem[/b]. It breaks the entire design of the game, where you are meant to carefully platform in certain areas, you can instead use the machine gun to fly over enemies' heads and get straight  to the end. I can't emphasize how much this ruins the experience of the game, because I didn't even think to realise I was playing the game wrong until halfway through the next area.\n\nI will come back to the problem of platforming later.\n\nThe next problem was the requirements to get the proper ending. This begins at the end of the third area. Avoiding spoilers, you are given a clear story cue, but to get the best ending, you have to, with no good reason, ignore the cue, and make an almost impossible jump. Then you have to get an item you have no good reason to find, and jump through a number of other hoops, just to unlock the possibility of reaching the best ending. Then, you have to go into some random little room when you should be running away from something to find the last level.\n\nYou are not given an indication that you should do [b]any[/b] of these things, and if you miss one of them and then save your game, then you can't go back and fix them. You have to start the game again.\n\nNow, back to the platforming: There is a large platforming section near the end of the game (outer wall), at which point you will have one kind or another of rocket boots. This platforming area would be among the peak of game design that this game has to offer, and it almost seems to be made with normal platforming in mind, but so much of it is simply destroyed by the player's ability to fly past it. The addition of the boosters to the game should reshape all of the levels following, but it ends up destroying them.\n\nNow, if you do somehow get the requirements for the end, you are met with two levels that make full use of the game mechanics: [spoiler]last cave[/spoiler] and [spoiler]blood-stained sanctuary[/spoiler]. These are challenging and rewarding, and really the best the game has to offer. The problem is that there's no difficulty curve. These are the only parts of the game that make proper use of the booster, so when you get to the latter, you are pretty much dropped in the deep-end and have to be extremely patient. I completed this game twice, once with the basic endings and once with the best ending, and [spoiler]blood-stained sanctuary[/spoiler] took more than a third of my total playtime to complete, chipping away at it an hour or two at a time. (Note: The actual level only took maybe 10 minutes to complete, it was just the number of attempts that added up)\n\nThere are some more minor things in this game that I think could be improved, like perhaps an autosave system, or just some better save-point placement to make the game's structure more clear.\n\nI'm certain there is more I've missed or forgotten, but I will move on to the rest of the game.\n\nThe pixel art is all very nice, fitting a consistent aesthetic, and the world is quirky and interesting. The characters are nothing to write home about, and the story is serviceable (bad guy is going to do bad things, better stop him), although one of the endings contains nothing short of a deus ex machina, which the characters then kinda acknowledge...? It's strange. The music was fairly good for a one-man project, even charming, but I think it's a tad overhyped. Finally, the translation.

Ese es Cave Story.\n\nEl juego es simple: Tomas un arma, saltas y disparas en 4 direcciones a cual sea el pobre sujeto que se meta en frente con un arsenal variado, entre cohetes, lasers y espadas lanzables.\n\nLos enemigos son numerosos y algunos bastante duros o muy dedicados a joderte la vida, pero no suelen ser muy complicados.\n\nEl plataformeo es uno de los puntos mas fuertes del juego, creeme, en ciertas partes la pasaras mal, pero si que es una experiencia.\n\nLos bosses definitivamente son un reto, eso, si te dejas intimidar por ellos.\n\nEl lore no es lo mas asombroso en comparacion a los demas puntos, pero no se queda atras en lo absoluto. \n\nEl ost... Es sencillamente maravilloso, acompa\u00f1a perfectamente el ambiente de los niveles y las batallas en los bosses, especialmente la batalla final... Es sencillamente excelente.\n\nLa dificultad... Es complicado, pero no tan dificil... Claro a menos que quieras entrar en el modo Hard... Pasaras un MUY mal rato, especialmente en cierta cueva y en adelante... pero si te sientes confiado en ello, podras sacarle el 100% al jugo del juego, una experiencia de dificultad que no se encuentra todos los dias.\n\nLos retos por fuera son un gran agregado al juego, especialmente Wind fortress y El boss rush.\n\nEn resumen: Este juego fue el ''Punto de inflexion'' en los juegos indie, ya que cuando salio su version original muchos hablaban del mismo y motivo a otros a meterse en el desarrollo de juegos indie. En este caso, esta remasterizacion grafica y con contenido extra es sencillamente perfecta.

Small joystick deadzone leads to unintended changes in direction during critical combat maneuvers. Weapon trajectories are too constrained or haphazard, leaving the player to attempt many cumbersome jump shots using the aforementioned unfavorable movement physics.\n\nNo autosave feature, which at times prevented story-advancing dialogue or sequences from occuring between deaths. Dialogue-intense cutscenes cannot be skipped ever. Some parts of the game become tedious bullet hells (in hard mode, nearly everything is a 1-hit kill).\n\nStory:\nNothing too compelling, but some of the darker themes of death and physical abuse clash poignantly with the fun, cartoon art style.

Some guns are hidden away and unlocked through completing side-objectives.\n\nShooting is functional. The guns had no impact and didn't feel fun to shoot. Thankfully, the different weapons you had access to (I unlocked 5) all played different enough roles that enjoyment was gained in deciding which gun was best fit in the situation I found myself in.\n\nThere is also an interesting system where you level up your guns as you collect experience from killing baddies. When you get injured, not only does your health go down, but your gun level goes down too. I felt that this was an unnecessary system as it double penalized the player for making mistakes; if the player wasn't doing well, they would be stuck in a vicious cycle where their guns would remain weak and end up not having fun with the higher levelled guns.\n\nThe baddies themselves also aren't that great. While they are good aesthetically, and each section comes with its own visually distinctive enemies, mechanically speaking they only come in two flavors: a melee type which charges/flies at you, and a ranged type which throws projectiles at you. Both injure you on contact. That's it. Disappointing to be honest. AM2R (Metroid) had such a large variety of enemies, many having a twist in how you take them down (not just shooting at them), whilst having other gameplay pillars to support it (good ones, mind you).\n\nThe controls are also pretty bad; your character feels super floaty, and the jetpack ability you get halfway through the game also feels incredibly awkward to control. I did however discover that you could send yourself up by shooting your machinegun downwards, which was a pleasant surprise and a great addition.\n\nIn game where shooting enemies is its core engagement, and shooting isn't fun, makes for a poor game.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\n\nI played Cave Story+, on Steam, which provides HD versions of its original pixel art aesthetic. Its good, but not amazing either.\n\nI quite appreciated that there were Christmas and Halloween reskins of every tile, many enemies, and almost every character, that activated during particular times of the month. I myself played through most of the game in Christmas mode and it was a treat. Plus points here for such a cool feature.\n\nStory: 4/10\n\nAs one half of the game's name, Cave Story /attempts/ to tell an interesting narrative. Unfortunately, the game's short game length meant that characters I was just introduced to end up getting killed of an hour or two later\u2014deaths which lacked any sort of emotional punch. Slight spoilers, but these deaths happened more than twice.\n\nIt also sets up an interesting universe that I am intrigued to learn more of, but unfortunately other than the critical path, no lore nuggets are present in the game. You only get to experience the main story (and an optional, bonus ending if you go through \"hell mode\"). The game's main antagonists, their backstory or their motivations, are barely expanded upon, and overall I feel there were too many weak narrative threads.\n\nThere is also a crucial character that can be killed off if you fail a particular jump. In my playthrough I had no idea that the jump I missed was so crucial to the story, only discovering it when I browsed the wiki. Such a easily fail-able challenge resulting in the player skipping a huge narrative thread is unacceptable. Perhaps it was to encourage replayability, but the game's mediocre combat system means I will disappointingly not be doing so.\n\nAM2R is a great example of telling a story through its world and the places you explore. Cave Story attempts to beat you on the head with a narrative that is neither compelling nor well-explained. Another game which I am playing through right now, Ubisoft's Child of Light, is also a better example of telling a short but strong narrative without beating you over the head over it.\n\nSound: 8/10\n\nThe game's soundtrack is stupendous and the game's redeeming quality. It's great. Just check out the title screen music and you'll love it.\n\nHowever, the sound design for stuff like your guns is weak, and sound effects for stuff like enemies is non-existent.\n\nOverall, Cave Story was an interesting experience. As one of the few \"good\" indie games of the 2000-2010 decade, I am sure it left its mark on the industry. Comparing it to AAA-produced titles like Konami's Castlevania is of course unfair, but I feel that this game is vastly inferior to the past 5 titles I have played in my trip through platformer history. Still, it marks a good transition to the golden age of indies from 2010 onwards, and I will be playing a few of these (platformer) titles next.\n\nI rate Cave Story 6/10.\n\nA mediocre story, with serviceable gunplay, but a good soundtrack. Its most definitely a modern game, and I did get some fun out of it. But its not noteworthy. Is it worth $15? Maybe. But there are better offerings out there. Try Shovel Knight for a guaranteed excellent platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1515179420, "timestamp_updated": 1515179420, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410705983638763428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39083624": {"recommendationid": "39083624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060499909", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1237, "last_played": 1396290326}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally the best 2d platformer ever. 13/10 if not more", "timestamp_created": 1515159081, "timestamp_updated": 1515159081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587306737899780273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39065306": {"recommendationid": "39065306", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986618829", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 189, "playtime_forever": 1035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1035, "last_played": 1515104097}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Se trata de un metroidvania (mapa enorme interconectado por puertas que iremos abriendo despu\u00e9s de hablar con cierto personaje o adquirir cierto objeto) con \u00e9nfasis en las plataformas y la acci\u00f3n, no es complicado si tenemos pr\u00e1ctica en este tipo de juegos pero como la exploraci\u00f3n es necesaria, hay que tener paciencia e incluso algo de suerte para no atascarnos y perder el tiempo dando vueltas.

The controls are responsive and tight. The aerial momentum doesn't suit me, but that could be just my opinion.\nNo game is without its flaws, and it's obvious this one has a bunch too. For example, i felt the Grasslands world is a little bit too repetitive, going through the same enemy nest 5 times. Difficulty spikes are present too, (although not in great amounts). Perhaps Monster X and Dragon Sisters could be the best example, being hell for most newcomers, like me.\nAlso, if you want to achieve the best ending, prepae to follow a lot of strict rules to do it.

As the player progress more is revealed through character dialogue and a few events, such as before and after a boss battle. There were a few moments that were kind of amusing, but the story here is pretty weak, and often generic.\n\nGame wise the action is never more than decent. Shoot, jump, swim, and navigate your way through a small but diverse set of locations, find some secrets, and really just explore. Most weapons are standard; blaster with three levels of power,Super Mario style bouncing fireballs, missiles, charge beam, etc. Upgradable versions help keep things balanced, such as a sword that unleashes a rapidly striking ghost, or the aforementioned charge beam. A few weapons are actually pretty cool, if a bit overpowered for the most part, which helps cut some of the monotony down.\n\nSpeaking of monotony, this game tends to be really tedious. Backtracking and fetch quests take up the bulk of the player's time, along with sometimes painfully slow dialogue boxes. You can't skip the dialogue, which can get really frustrating because most f it is forgettable, boring, or just bad, and if you\u2019ve messed up and need to restart you have to sit through those big chunks of dialogue all over again. It can be really frustrating.\n\nThere is a lot of okay level design, but it is, mostly very plain and uninspired. You get big empty chasms with platforms, or narrow hallways with platforms. I felt a strong sense of atmosphere from the floating island of talking dogs. For whatever faults I felt playing this game, this sense of atmosphere and presentation gave me a sense of nostalgia, particularly for the old days of Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis era gaming. Points to the designer for accomplishing this, it's just a shame more wasn't done with it. What we get is a lot of potential, but not a lot of very exciting execution.\n\nControls are okay, but not especially tight with a game pad, which is a shame because some of what is needed to win will take precision that just isn't there without a keyboard. Using both a PS3 controller and an Xbox One controller, I found that often the left and right movements would stall or not respond properly. For some of the trickier extra stages, like Blood Stained Sanctuary, I found myself depending heavily on the arrow keys despite spending a lot my time trying to make it work on the d-pad.\n\nThe soundtracks are pretty good, very reminiscent of 16bit era platforming games, with three versions of the game's score to choose from in the options menu. Graphical options are pretty sparse, but this isn't really a bad thing as the game's styles really are pretty good at helping set the tone.\n\nOverall this looks and behaves like a classic 16bit era game, but with only really basic level and quest design elements. Visually this is mediocre, but serviceable. Some might say that it is important to take the age of the game into consideration, but SNES games were doing a lot of what's in this game long before this came out, and they were doing it better. Still, this is an impressive effort despite its lackluster parts.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that some bugs linger, and since this game is not longer supported by the developers you will have to take it \u201cAS IS\u201d. This includes the buggy controls, crashes, a broken achievement (with a user made fix), and other quirks.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Atmosphere\n    [*]Music is decent\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Annoying dialogue\n    [*]Heavy backtracking\n    [*]Bland story\n    [*]Lame level design\n    [*]Tedious game play\n    [*]Boring graphics\n    [*]Unreliable controls\n    [*]Unfixed bugs\n    [*]Not developer supported\n    [*]Doesn't always play nice with D-pads\n[/list]\n\n[b]Verdict: 4/10[/b]\n\nI've played this game several times over the years, and every time the words 'boring' and 'overrated' came to mind.

I really need to formulate a proper review so I can properly describe why I feel that way, though to make it short, although it can be quite infuriating on the difficulty and vagueness in certain actions, it makes up for it in a big way with the fantastic run-and-shoot gameplay, great art (both the original pixel art and remastered), excellent music, likeable and/or interesting characters and even a story that starts pretty basic but takes a turn that deceive the look of the game. It also has quite a bit replay value thanks to the multiple endings and secrets.\n\nThat aside, there's a few versions and ports of this game released over the years, with this being touted as a definitive version of sorts. I have to agree to that sentiment, as it has the option to play with the original or the remastered graphics (from the Wii Ware release), the option to three soundtracks (original, remastered from WiiWare and another remastered apparently from the 3DS version), the bonuses of the Wii Ware release, other bonuses included here and an extra potential for modding.

There have been games that are amazing, but just not there yet. I remember back when i had a wii, I discovered a game: Cave Story. I got the game, not expecting much but still anticipating some fun. Countless playthroughs, endless amounts of fun, and six years later, I continue to marvel and enjoy this masterpeice that is merely a 2 hour long game. Its beautiful, each and every sprite is unique and has its own personallity. Each boss is unique in that they appear in different areas, some being optional. Each has their own history, their own story. The scenes are beautiful and the level design doesnt get much better. While you could aregue its a little straight forward and hints at its own objective, there are always secrets like invisible hearts. Whether or not you play it for fun or professionally. It never gets old, until you play every ending, get every last achievement, discover every secret, the game is fun. You could do the same run 100 times and you'd still find something funnier or new.\n\nThis game has taught me alot.
