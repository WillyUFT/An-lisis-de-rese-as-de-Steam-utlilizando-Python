It also has an extremely rich world to explore and endless lore that adds to the world building. \n\nI am not for sure on this, but if I was able to add all my hours across all platforms, this is probably my most played game of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1700524675, "timestamp_updated": 1700525326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150519696": {"recommendationid": "150519696", "author": {"steamid": "76561199443950839", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1699650587}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not ashamed to say that I have bought this game on every type of console that i've owned over the years.

It doesn't have any quest choices, any branching storylines, any narrative consequence, or many compelling relationships with other characters. Combat, dialogue, story, and quests are all underbaked and amateur even for Bethesda. \n\nWhat Skyrim DOES have is the single greatest open world of all time. For 12 years TES: V Skyrim has remained the gold standard for open world level design and its not even close. Exploring the snowy wastes of Skyrim for the first time was honestly like nothing else I had ever experienced. \n\nThe mistake of games like BotW and TotK is that the outcome of exploration is never a mystery. The rewards for exploring is always a shrine or a Korok seed. These lost their luster for me after the first dozen and became a slog after the next 20. \n\nIn Skyrim, there is something unique and mysterious around every corner. A dungeon to explore, a bandit camp to clear, a quest to do, etc. The allure of the many thousands of nooks and crannies of Skyrim and its many dungeons is immense. Every time I play it, I discover new places I had never see before. \n\nContrary to what you may have heard about Skyrim, it doesn't hold your hand. At least not when it comes to exploration. You will always have a quest marker pointing you to your objective but that's it. There are no specialized markers or separate activity for clearing out bandit camps, collecting dragon priest masks, or collecting some arbitrary collectible for completion. All of this is treated as just normal gameplay.

Even if you don't as crazy with them like me. Skyrim isn't a great game, but it certainly has stood the test of time. And it's one of my guilty pleasures. Just be aware that Bethesda is a hyper-corrupt and soulless company who's successes are more manufactured than anything. Almost accidental as well.\n\nNow if you want an actually *good* TES game, try out Morrowind (or maybe Daggerfall, but that game is not my cup of tea). It's the only TES game I'd call actually legit decent to good on its own merits (though I guess Daggerfall is good for what it is), despite still being a janky bug fest like the rest of the series.

If anything, this shows an issue withing the Bethesda Studios, that keeps making Oblivion again and again with the same poor scripting and abundance of bugs.\nIn my opinion, the game just does not have any strong \"Pros\".\n- Some praise Skyrim for its atmosphere, but it is very mediocre at most, and perhaps it is I who is blind.\n- Others praise the story, but it is very childish, predictable and often boring.\nAs for \"Cons\", there are some which are not too crucial to make this a bad game, but are definitely annoying.\n- The menu and hotkeys on the PC version are absolutely horrible. I have clicked on the wrong thing so many times when clicking on items with a mouse, and it interfered with the keyboard controls, that it really made me annoyed.\n- The spells were absolutely butchered and were made unfun. The spells system overall has been degrading from entry to entry, having peaked in Daggerfall, but has been immensely simplified and made boring in Skyrim in all aspects.\n- The skill system is horrible as well. The skill points system that artificially makes the skill more efficient is absolutely awful, so that instead of for example swinging a weapon and getting better at it, the player will have to be limited as to what skill to invest in due to them being limited.\n- The autolevelling and difficulty system should not be present in such games. It is a plague that follows Bethesda games from Morrowind, and though it can be tolerable there, it is not imlemented properly in Skyrim, though not as bad as in Oblivion.\n- The way the game plays, makes only few builds viable, with the obvious choice of being a Stealth Archer with Smithing and Enchanting. You cannot be a purely melee build or avoid smithing and enchanting, otherwise the game will become very unsatisfying to play.\n- The quest design is very poor and consists of going to a marker, going to the same boring cave, killing/stealing the target and reporting back. Even so, the very presence of quest markers is absolutely horrible and is made for people to brainlessly follow from one point to another (and playing without this marker is very inconvenient, due to how the quests are designed).", "timestamp_created": 1700289711, "timestamp_updated": 1700290987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150336309": {"recommendationid": "150336309", "author": {"steamid": "76561199474620207", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3574, "playtime_at_review": 10041, "last_played": 1700730187}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are in recovery from something and need a world to escape into, this is a beautiful and welcoming one.", "timestamp_created": 1700287795, "timestamp_updated": 1700287795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150333790": {"recommendationid": "150333790", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064408688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20323, "last_played": 1689242160}, "language": "english", "review": "I finally got to the cloud district, eat poo nazeem", "timestamp_created": 1700283983, "timestamp_updated": 1700283983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150331562": {"recommendationid": "150331562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027921683", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 60606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 525, "playtime_at_review": 60231, "last_played": 1700708483}, "language": "english", "review": "finn", "timestamp_created": 1700280631, "timestamp_updated": 1700280631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150331549": {"recommendationid": "150331549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100931779", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 430, "playtime_at_review": 4527, "last_played": 1700361284}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean c'mon...

great game. But when I played it, I didn't get it and had a negative view for years. I returned recently to see if I missed something, but my opinion got even more negative.\n\nThe main story and the Dark Brotherhood side mission are okay, but the rest is pretty bad. The quest design was surprisingly bad; sometimes, I had to choose answers I didn't want. In the Thieves Guild mission, my character, who was a master wizard, said he had no magic or strength, which didn't make sense. They also forced me to sell my soul for third-rate armor to beat a weak enemy, with no option to refuse.\n\nEven with the bad quest design, it was one of the better quests, as the others were basically fetch quests with a pretense of a story that was so boring I forgot it once the quest ended. As for characters, I don't remember the names of anyone I talked to except Serena. The marriage candidates, in particular, are forgettable randos with only two sentences of dialogue.\n\nIf the story, NPCs, and quest design aren't great, the gameplay must be, right? Nope. Magic is weak for a long time, sword gameplay doesn't feel right, and many people end up going for sneak archer to avoid the unimpressive combat. People call this game \"wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle,\" but I had more joy falling into a puddle than playing this game.\n\nAnd let's not forget the bugs. Just before I started the Thieves Guild quest, my character became bugged, and sneak never worked, making me visible for miles despite having the best stealth gear, 100 sneak, muffled spells, and invisibility potions. I couldn't fix this bug, so I ended up playing a fake spy mage casting calm on everyone and taking everything without a fight.", "timestamp_created": 1700257144, "timestamp_updated": 1700257144, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150304927": {"recommendationid": "150304927", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208588285", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 1969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "playtime_at_review": 1966, "last_played": 1700767690}, "language": "english", "review": "i like walking", "timestamp_created": 1700257069, "timestamp_updated": 1700257069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150304673": {"recommendationid": "150304673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152868108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 163, "playtime_at_review": 3636, "last_played": 1700270826}, "language": "english", "review": "yes.", "timestamp_created": 1700256732, "timestamp_updated": 1700256732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150304099": {"recommendationid": "150304099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851967363", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 387, "playtime_at_review": 7191, "last_played": 1700785701}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1700256037, "timestamp_updated": 1700256037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150303404": {"recommendationid": "150303404", "author": {"steamid": "76561199063521172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1700255112}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ser\u00e9 la \u00fanica persona en el mundo que Skyrim le aburre.", "timestamp_created": 1700255149, "timestamp_updated": 1700255149, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150303279": {"recommendationid": "150303279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274013417", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 13427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4468, "playtime_at_review": 9892, "last_played": 1700782508}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Good old Skyrim[/h1] This game has a special place in my heart.

Nonetheless, there's fun to be had in the region of Skyrim, just as there was fun to be had in Oblivion and Morrowind. Soundtrack is a highlight, as Jeremy Soule reprises his role as a master of atmosphere for the... I think third game in a row? A lot of the game's questlines come across as exciting and tense, but fall flat at the first level of player's scrutiny. Magic system is neutered compared to Oblivion's, which is neutered compared to Morrowind's, and that goes the same for both weapons and skills alike.\n\nMy main opinion of this game is that it's great if you want to go on a casual, no thoughts head empty adventure, but If you're looking for a game that makes more of an edge in the story department, try either the earlier Elder Scrolls titles,

I've read so many comments that people wish they could forget the entire game and then play it again for the first time, with the first discoveries and revelations.  It was created just on the edge of better graphics for higher end games in 2011, so it still looks good 12 years after it was released.  I have the Anniversary edition.  The story itself is fun and I love wandering around such a beautifully created world.  The voice acting for ordinary characters is quite limited, unless the same character is moving from city to city and I end up talking to him or her over and over and they're doing different jobs and wearing different clothes.  The quests are good, some less interesting to me personally, but the main story line is fascinating.  The quests get buggy and I can't finish many of them because some script gets messed up, and I can't give the letter to someone because I didn't get it or the proper dialogue doesn't load properly, but I don't really care about that.  Overall I'm glad I bought it and I will play it over and over again just for fun, and try building a different character each time with different strengths, to see how it turns out.", "timestamp_created": 1699999855, "timestamp_updated": 1699999855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150138133": {"recommendationid": "150138133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119619565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 46279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1214, "playtime_at_review": 45095, "last_played": 1700792115}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1699999295, "timestamp_updated": 1699999295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150137521": {"recommendationid": "150137521", "author": {"steamid": "76561199113737672", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1531, "playtime_at_review": 610, "last_played": 1700202012}, "language": "english", "review": "best rpg ever", "timestamp_created": 1699998413, "timestamp_updated": 1699998413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150137229": {"recommendationid": "150137229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260331010", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 294, "playtime_at_review": 1177, "last_played": 1700180106}, "language": "spanish", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1699997983, "timestamp_updated": 1699997983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150136956": {"recommendationid": "150136956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189438794", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 6301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2986, "playtime_at_review": 3912, "last_played": 1700779761}, "language": "english", "review": "Must have been the wind...", "timestamp_created": 1699997599, "timestamp_updated": 1699997599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150136138": {"recommendationid": "150136138", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059689075", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 4310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 474, "playtime_at_review": 4310, "last_played": 1699846041}, "language": "english", "review": "This has to be one of my all time favorite RPG.

RPG devs don't need years of experience and education on how to make RPG game, they can just play Skyrim for one time to understand all mysteries of RPG making. \n\nQuesting lesson (to solve the hyper interest of gaming pattern in modern world): Don't make quest pace too fast, for example if one quest finishes don't just go on to give another point of interest, instead after you finish quest chain and accept new quest from same NPC, make it look random and ordinary - for example after you accept quest, make that npc talk something important or just lore-wise random fun things, for example you take quest and you don't immedietely go on the journey, instead you want your quest NPC to talk some stuff after you take quest. Even though you can go immedietely, this kind of quest design teaches person patience and that's what we need in every sphere of life, no matter if it's gaming and I would say especially if it's something hyper zoomer like what gaming became.\n\nQuesting vibe: Randomness and ordinary. Make it look familiar to your real life situations, let the quest guide you in wrong paths sometimes and let it lead your character into random encounters. That's all I can say, make it look realistic and immersive and not the follow this kind of quest where everything is how it's said in quest. \n\nWorld building and NPCs: Again, make it look random and ordinary. For example you enter settlement and immediately you see NPCs doing head-off murder because of unknown things, and later on while you are on your way to some other quest, design some NPC to approach you and tell you the truth behind this murder. Make it look random and the game will embrace immersion without any effort of something more. The extra-ordinary is what you want in RPGs and not the straight-forward vibe or situations.\n\nAdd things like optional survival and you will make game twice as immersive. With all the effects that Skyrim has - cold (if game is in freezing area), hunger, rest. I tend to play Skyrim with and without survival mode from time to time. I usually let it on and after I ''mess up'' somewhere, I immediately uncheck the option to make it easier for me and play the game, then I can check this option again when I am back into settlement. This helps me not lose pace on the game since I am somewhat of a manipulated ''bot'' that just played multiplayer for whole of my life, and now that I found out how things work, I wish to play singleplayer games more often, just due to simple reason of building patience and humility instead of hyper-proud meta mind that just wants to compete in games. \n\nI understand that it's hard to accept these things, but that's what gaming has became and I wish to somewhat try to change this, even by writing this last comment. Devs should learn a lot from Skyrim and embrace this kind of ''gaming ideology'' even if they are devs of MMORPGs for example (which is my favourite genre)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699991675,

You want to completely change the game so much that your $3500 gaming rig starts looking nervous and your friends can't turn away from the screen showing something that looks more real than real life?!?!

However, after playing it for a while on Steam, I can confidently say that my skepticism has been completely shattered. This remaster is a true gem.\n\nThe most noticeable improvement is the stunning graphics. The updated visuals breathe new life into the already beautiful world of Skyrim. Weather effects, foliage, character models \u2013 everything looks crisper and more detailed than ever before. The new lighting system adds depth to the environments, making exploration a visually captivating experience.\n\nBut it's not just a visual upgrade; the Special Edition also includes all official DLCs, which is a massive bonus. This means more quests, locations, and items to discover, making an already vast game even more expansive. The addition of mods is also a game-changer, allowing players to customize their experience further.\n\nAnother aspect that sets the Special Edition apart is its improved stability. Skyrim was notorious for its occasional crashes and bugs, but Bethesda has done an excellent job ironing out these issues. The game runs smoothly, and I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs or crashes during my playthroughs.\n\nThe familiar gameplay mechanics that made Skyrim addictive remain intact. The freedom to create your own character and play the game however you desire is still at the heart of the experience. The combat, leveling, and skill progression systems all feel as satisfying as ever, ensuring that the gameplay remains engaging and immersive.\n\nAs for the audio, the soundtrack remains as enchanting as ever, providing the perfect ambiance for this epic adventure. The voice acting holds up well, and the sound effects further enhance the immersion.\n\nOverall, Skyrim Special Edition on Steam is everything I hoped for. It not only offers a substantial visual upgrade but also resolves many of the original game's technical issues. \n\n\n\n[b] -Let me guess, Someone stole your sweetroll!

i was 12 and now I've had the opportunity to play it again at 22 and i must say... this game is absolutely amazing and most game developers should take notes because Skyrim is a game that is done just right. From all things that this game offers from it's engaging story lines, to its astonishing graphics and the immersion that the game offers to the player is nothing short of of an awe that i felt while playing this game. but all things said, nothing is perfect and Skyrim does have it's flaws so lets explore them briefly, the game is a little buggy and can become a little frustrating at times however it is something that can be overlooked easily and google does usually have solutions to the bugs i.e. Greybeards giving you the same quest to go to arc-wind point to find a word of power which you already have and thus blocks you from finding any more words of power through those respective quests. furthermore, there are a large number of bugs and glitches in Skyrim but don't be fooled, these can actually be fun to explore and even funnier to witness and these can go from anything as simple as falling through the world map to witnessing a giant fly on a dragon across the sky, watching the giant kill the dragon and then watching the giant get yeeted into oblivion xd.

This remastered version of Bethesda's epic open-world RPG is a mixed bag of nostalgia, graphical improvements, and a few lingering issues, but it's undeniably a journey worth revisiting.\n\nFirst and foremost, the visual upgrades in Skyrim Special Edition are immediately noticeable. The game now runs on a more stable engine, and the improved graphics, updated textures, and enhanced lighting breathe new life into the world of Skyrim. The snowy landscapes, rugged mountains, and dark dungeons look more immersive and stunning than ever. It's a definite improvement over the original, particularly on modern gaming hardware.\n\nThe inclusion of all three DLC expansions\u2014Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn\u2014is a welcome addition. These expansions add depth to the game's content and lore, offering players more quests, locations, and activities to engage with, making the Special Edition a comprehensive package.\n\nSkyrim's open-world exploration remains one of its most outstanding features. The vastness of the game world, filled with countless caves, forts, cities, and hidden treasures, offers endless hours of adventuring. The freedom to play as any character archetype you desire, from stealthy thieves to mighty warriors or powerful mages, ensures a diverse and highly replayable experience.\n\nThat said, Skyrim Special Edition is not without its flaws. Some of the same issues present in the original release persist, including occasional AI quirks and the infamous Bethesda bugs. While the Special Edition has seen some bug fixes and optimizations, it's still far from a bug-free experience. Players may encounter peculiar physics interactions, NPCs behaving oddly, or the occasional crash to the desktop. These issues can be both amusing and frustrating, depending on your perspective.\n\nWhile the graphical improvements are praiseworthy, they may not be enough to satisfy players who have come to expect more from a remaster in the modern gaming landscape. Compared to some other remasters or remakes, Skyrim Special Edition's upgrades might feel a bit underwhelming, especially for those who were hoping for a more extensive overhaul of the game's engine and mechanics.\n\nThe modding community, which has always been a significant part of the Skyrim experience, benefits from the Special Edition. The availability of mods is more extensive and, due to improved engine stability, can offer even more creative and game-enhancing possibilities. This is a notable advantage for players who want to tailor their Skyrim experience to their specific tastes.\n\nIn conclusion, Skyrim Special Edition is a welcome return to one of gaming's most celebrated open-world RPGs. The graphical improvements, inclusion of DLC content, and enduring charm of the game make it worth revisiting for both longtime fans and newcomers. However, the game's technical issues, albeit somewhat improved, still persist. If you can look past these issues or mod your way around them, Skyrim Special Edition offers countless hours of exploration and adventure in a rich, fantastical world. It's a familiar and beloved journey that continues to stand the test of time, even if it doesn't fully live up to the expectations of a modern remaster.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699418929, "timestamp_updated": 1699418929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149741537": {"recommendationid": "149741537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093930483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 76544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3592, "playtime_at_review": 72660, "last_played": 1700792201}, "language": "english", "review": "it is moddable", "timestamp_created": 1699417504, "timestamp_updated": 1699417504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149741289": {"recommendationid": "149741289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278007837", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 711, "playtime_at_review": 514, "last_played": 1700128178}, "language": "english", "review": "I just love it together with all its stupid glitches and bugs", "timestamp_created": 1699416949, "timestamp_updated": 1699416949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149740172": {"recommendationid": "149740172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148289217", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 841, "last_played": 1699415263}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1699414681, "timestamp_updated": 1699414681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149739829": {"recommendationid": "149739829", "author": {"steamid": "76561199567772180", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1699413896}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played this game for the last 12 years and still keep finding new things to do and more ways to play.

Ich finde es gro\u00dfartig, wie man seine eigenen H\u00e4user bauen, seine eigene R\u00fcstung herstellen und sogar seine eigenen Waffen herstellen kann. Dieses Spiel ist wirklich einzigartig und kann gar nicht erst anfangen Stellen Sie sich vor, wie The Elder Scrolls VI aussehen wird. Vielleicht gibt es sogar noch mehr zu bieten als The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Hoffentlich wird Bethesda die gleiche Liebe zeigen, die sie jedem anderen Elder Scrolls-Spiel entgegengebracht haben. Ich kann mir wirklich nicht vorstellen, wie gro\u00df die Community in all den Jahren gewachsen ist, mit einer st\u00e4ndig aktiven Community und einer aktiven Modding-Community. Das alles beweist, wie gut alle zusammenkommen und ein Spiel und sogar seine Franchise genie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen.", "timestamp_created": 1699166887, "timestamp_updated": 1699166887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493220776319503784", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149567565": {"recommendationid": "149567565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096886989", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 9746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2245, "playtime_at_review": 6722, "last_played": 1700792495}, "language": "english", "review": "magic go brrrrr", "timestamp_created": 1699165242, "timestamp_updated": 1699165242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149567396": {"recommendationid": "149567396", "author": {"steamid": "76561199361506393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1104, "playtime_at_review": 1842, "last_played": 1699762115}, "language": "english", "review": "you can sex the dragon", "timestamp_created": 1699165006, "timestamp_updated": 1699165006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149566262": {"recommendationid": "149566262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969710509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 749, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1699827941}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game", "timestamp_created": 1699163193, "timestamp_updated": 1699163193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149564991": {"recommendationid": "149564991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045791998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2637, "last_played": 1665556022}, "language": "english", "review": "Get it.", "timestamp_created": 1699161207, "timestamp_updated": 1699161207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149562291": {"recommendationid": "149562291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383366135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 3050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3050, "last_played": 1591556380}, "language": "english", "review": "Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an first-person action rgp with a heavily inspired Nordic theme part of the Elder Scrolls fantasy setting.  While the character plays, fights and experiences the game in first, or optionally third, person.  Many of the tasks the player accomplishes difficulty or effectiveness is dependent of the player character's stats.\n\nThese stats are increased primarily through use in game.  Although, trainers and books may also be used to increase these stats.  Which is good, as the dedication to increasing stats are not equal among them. Skyrim also features a two hand mechanic mostly for fighting or spell casting.  In that the player can equip an item, weapon or spell in each hand, barring things that require both such as large weapons, for use during play.  \n\nThe world of Skyrim is vast with dozens upon dozens of points of interest and places to adventure.  However, as broad as the game is, rarely does it have much depth.  Most adventures are pretty simple, especially the 'endless' ones which are basically repeated over and over.  Though, the sheer epicness of the game is still quite incredible.\n\nThe gameplay is fine.  Once the player character has a few levels, decent gear and a solid understanding of the mechanics, Skyrim is a rather easy game.  Even on its most difficult setting, which just increases the health to and damage from enemies.  \n\nA pro and a con of the game is that there is little replay value.  A player can choose to accomplish everything in the game regardless of what their player character's abilities are.  Player characters can theoretically max all of their stats out as well.   So while the player may focus on a fantasy archetype such as fighter, rogue or wizard; they can easily branch out and do all three easily.  Which is less a drawback, as Skyrrim can take a very long time to complete.  I finished Skyrim on Xbox360, and I am certain it took me well over 100 hours.  And easily could have been a few hundred hours.\n\nSkyrim is like a warm but a little scratchy sweater.  It comfortable, familiar and soft.  So you like to spend some time with it every now and again.  However, spend tons of time with it, and the small discomforts become more glaring.

Endless exploration, beautifully crafted worlds & it just hits that fine balance between an endless grind to get anywhere or we'll make things too easy to cheat the system & plough through to the end (although there's so much to do in this game, finishing the main quest-line was never a priority for me).\n\nDon't have much negative things to say about the added community mods, nice to see Bethesda cashing in on other people's better ideas to make a fantastic game slightly more entertaining isn't it?.\n\nAnd then of course we have the modding community outside of Skyrim's boundaries creating fantastic content daily.

Within are hundreds of hours of adventure, most of it satisfyingly scripted and designed. Your experience takes place in a majestic land crammed with inviting secrets, intrigue, danger, and rewards. You'll start as a loin-cloth-clad weakling in a cave and end as a demigod bedecked in magical items, devastating weapons and spells, and the skills to wield them against awesome enemies. Along the way you'll make some friends, but mostly you'll leave a trail of bloody destruction. [I]Skyrim[/I]'s world is gritty, cold, and dark and it's often hard to discern right from wrong. Almost always the answer is violence.\n\nMy previous Elder Scrolls experience was [I]Morrowind[/I], which I called \"a masterpiece buried under a mud flow\". I'm happy to say that most of the old problems have been overcome in [I]Skyrim[/I]. Combat is actually exciting and demands your attention, whether it's aiming your two-handed weapon for a slow, crushing hit, surveying a good spot to rain arrows on a bandit camp, sneaking behind enemies to backstab them one at a time, or leading monsters into an enclosed area where you can incinerate them with fire magic. The right way to play is \"survival mode\", which forces you to eat, sleep, and keep warm, and severely limits your ability to fast-travel. It's immersive and heart-pounding, though it can make the endgame drag on a bit too long.\n\nDespite its devout commitment to exploratory freedom, if you insist on role-playing as a righteous paladin then you will miss out on some of the best quests. The world of Skyrim wants you to get your hands dirty. Unfortunately, worldbuilding is more broad than deep. I've never been inspired by the world of Tamriel: it's a run-of-the-mill post-Tolkien world with all the usual fantasy genre clich\u00e9s. The lore is very elaborated in thousands of pages of documents, but I find it almost all skippable. At the end of the day Tamriel is to Elder Scrolls as Forgotten Realms is to D&D: just a bunch of ready-made world stuff in which adventures and stories can take place. That's fine. Elder Scrolls is not [I]The Witcher[/I].\n\nThe game systems are many and mostly exciting, and whatever path you choose to take will likely be fulfilling. There are heavyweight and lightweight combat skills, thievery and assassination, many schools of entertaining magic, alchemy and smithing, and loot and money as well as ways to make money. Each system is elaborate enough to keep you occupied, reaping massive combat improvements if you persist. And yet the game practically forces you to avoid over-specialization, as skills max out at 100 and increasing skills is the only way to gain levels. Reached 100? Time to explore a system you've previously ignored, though you can also reset the skill by making it \"legendary\". Unfortunately the economy is quite broken, as around mid-game I was already filthy rich and stopped worrying about money.\n\nI've played [I]Skyrim[/I] for the first time in 2023 and thus could enjoy more than a decade of community modding. I kept the gameplay vanilla but completely overhauled the graphics and UI. The base game looked great in 2011 and is still very playable as is, but mods can make it look like 2020 AAA. One thing mods can't easily fix is the loading screens between the world and locations, as well as the meager scale of \"cities\" (~15 houses each). It's actually a step back from [I]Morrowind[/I] in this respect! Though the game engine hasn't aged well, Jeremy Soule's soundtrack is timeless, gorgeous, and so intrinsic to the [I]Skyrim[/I] experience. (He's an awful person, unfortunately.)\n\nAre there bugs? It says \"Bethesda\" on the cover, so you bet it does. Despite installing a mod that fixes hundreds of them, I still encountered far too many dispiriting quest-breaking and general bugs. They're all fixable with community tips and console commands, but it absolutely pulls you out of the experience. Bugs are easily the worst thing about [I]Skyrim[/I], and easily the worst thing about Bethesda.\n\nAnd there's general clunkiness. Movement controls can be frustrating: getting stuck on a piece of scenery that seems only 1 mm high is normal and very annoying during tense combat. AI is sub-par: enemies give up far too easily on pursuing you if you just run to another room, and they seem perfectly happy to walk over the dead bodies of their friends you've just murdered as if nothing had happened. Your buddies, too, often act like impulsive idiots and are usually more trouble than help in a mission. If you quicksave in a safe situation then you might load it later to find an enemy right next to you, instant-killing you before you can do anything. And finally: the horse system is 100% frustration.\n\nThese and many other annoyances can likely be fixed with mods, but ... modding is an overwhelming rabbit hole. Don't waste too much time tinkering. Play the game! Deal with the bugs! Viva Bethesda!\n\nI recommend [I]Skyrim[/I] without reservation. Whatever aggravating problems it has, its ability to delight and surprise, challenge and reward, endures. The time investment is considerable, but the memories you make will last forever.

After all this time, I finally got around to it, but it's safe to say that my experience was a mixed bag. Perhaps it's just a case of playing many modern games, but Skyrim felt rather outdated to me, and getting through it was a struggle at times.\n\nFirst and foremost, I can't deny the sheer scope and ambition of Skyrim. The open world, the freedom to explore, and the countless quests and adventures waiting to be had are truly remarkable. The game's lore and world-building are second to none, and it's easy to see why it has left such a lasting impact on the RPG genre. The vast and diverse land of Skyrim is a testament to the dedication of the developers.\n\nHowever, it's impossible to ignore the game's age. Released in 2011, Skyrim's graphics, character animations, and overall visual fidelity simply can't compare to what we've come to expect from modern games. Playing it after experiencing the graphical wonders of recent titles was jarring. It's like going back in time, and not necessarily in a good way.\n\nThe gameplay also showed its age. Combat felt clunky, and the AI of both allies and enemies left a lot to be desired. The menu system, while functional, was far from user-friendly. It's clear that these elements were groundbreaking at the time, but they haven't aged well.\n\nHowever, one saving grace for Skyrim is its fantastic modding community. The game's mod support is outstanding, and it breathes new life into the aging experience. Mods can drastically improve graphics, overhaul gameplay mechanics, and add countless new quests, items, and features. It's amazing to see how dedicated fans have continued to enhance and expand upon the game over the years. Thanks to modding, you can transform Skyrim into a much more contemporary and enjoyable experience, mitigating many of its inherent issues.", "timestamp_created": 1699029958, "timestamp_updated": 1699029958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149451172": {"recommendationid": "149451172", "author": {"steamid": "76561199554071426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 371, "playtime_at_review": 1549, "last_played": 1699654458}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly ADDICTING.

"--------------------------------------------------------Importante------------------------------------------------\nLo que m\u00e1s destaca de Skyrim es su inmersi\u00f3n. Desde los impresionantes paisajes monta\u00f1osos y bosques frondosos hasta las ciudades llenas de vida y los personajes memorables que pueblan este reino, el juego te envuelve en un mundo que se siente completamente real. La atenci\u00f3n al detalle es asombrosa, desde el destello del sol en las aguas heladas de los r\u00edos hasta los rugidos de los dragones que acechan los cielos.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------Jugabilidad------------------------------------------------\nEl sistema de juego es igualmente impresionante. La libertad que se te da para explorar y tomar decisiones es insuperable. Puedes convertirte en un guerrero, un mago, un ladr\u00f3n, o cualquier combinaci\u00f3n de estos roles, y el juego se adapta a tu elecci\u00f3n. Las misiones son variadas y fascinantes, con historias profundas y personajes que te llegan al coraz\u00f3n. La posibilidad de personalizar tu personaje y mejorar sus habilidades te permite jugar a tu manera.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------Sonidos---------------------------------------------------\nLa m\u00fasica y la banda sonora merecen una menci\u00f3n especial. Jeremy Soule cre\u00f3 una partitura que te sumerge a\u00fan m\u00e1s en el mundo de Skyrim. Cada pieza musical complementa perfectamente la atm\u00f3sfera del juego y te hace sentir la grandeza de este mundo.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------Atemporal------------------------------------------------\nSkyrim tambi\u00e9n ha envejecido excepcionalmente bien. A pesar de su lanzamiento inicial en 2011, el juego sigue siendo popular y se ha beneficiado de mods creados por la comunidad que a\u00f1aden una cantidad inmensa de contenido adicional y mejoras visuales.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------Resumen--------------------------------------------------\nEn resumen, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim es un juego que merece un lugar especial en la historia de los videojuegos. Es una experiencia inmersiva que te atrapa desde el principio y te lleva a un mundo m\u00e1gico lleno de maravillas y peligros. Si a\u00fan no has tenido la oportunidad de explorar Skyrim, te recomiendo encarecidamente que lo hagas. Este juego es una obra maestra que nunca pasa de moda y sigue siendo un cl\u00e1sico atemporal.", "timestamp_created": 1698913232, "timestamp_updated": 1698913232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

"language": "english", "review": "The best quest line in this game is Dragonborn and then second best is Dawnguard. The expansions' story lines are better than the main game's story lines, although the Dark Brotherhood is another great quest line that is in the base game of Skyrim. Overall, the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves' Guild are really fun storylines, but they're significantly worse than the same story lines in Oblivion. The combat is much better than Oblivion, and the leveling system is also better. The RPG elements of Skyrim are very simple compared to Oblivion, similar to Fallout 4's simplicity compared to Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. Being a stealth archer makes the combat extremely easy, so I usually go with a magic build or a warrior build rather than a stealth build. It takes a long time to get skills up to 100, and if you legendary the skill it almost becomes not worth it to get it back to 100. Overall, the leveling is simple but fun, as the perks have a lot of cool abilities and specialties. The game is intricate enough to keep you immersed for 100's of hours, and if you like Fallout 4 or Starfield, this is a must play as it is similar but better than both of those. I highly recommend this game, as it has hundreds if not thousands of quests and almost a dozen quest lines that keep you occupied even when you think you have done everything there is to do. When you finish every named quest, it will make up things to do or keep you occupied with building your own house. The mods add a lot to this game, but it's worthwhile to play the vanilla version, as you can sink tons of hours into the main game and the DLC's that come with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1698859612, "timestamp_updated": 1698859612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149322596": {"recommendationid": "149322596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801244114", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 4532, "last_played": 1699734234}, "language": "spanish", "review": "mu bien mu weno", "timestamp_created": 1698859500, "timestamp_updated": 1698859500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149320518": {"recommendationid": "149320518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253667838", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 17645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 334, "playtime_at_review": 15208, "last_played": 1699738519}, "language": "english", "review": "masterpice", "timestamp_created": 1698857213, "timestamp_updated": 1698857213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149319986": {"recommendationid": "149319986", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126261735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 336, "playtime_at_review": 2152, "last_played": 1700082445}, "language": "english", "review": "just saw a blood dragon dive bomb into the earth.

It's beloved. It's okay. Skyrim is to gaming what a good day at McDonald's is to food. By that, I mean that afternoon when you're on the road, you're hungry and there isn't much around. You see the golden arches down the street and you hit the fast food jackpot. The fries just came out of the fryer and they're warm, crispy and well salted. The burger just came off the flat top and the ingredients are as fresh as you can expect. It's not going to win a Michelin star, it's not going to receive rave reviews. It's just average food done well. Skyrim is a lot of good, some bad, but nothing great. There are no stunning visuals, most of the quests are forgettable and the environment overall is generic Viking somehow made even more generic than usual. it'll keep you busy for hours and hours and you'll probably like them even when confronted with the laughably absurd logic of the game world and the design decisions that hold it back. It's peak Bethesda. It's passable and without many competitors or choice, it's one of your few options. Sadly, it's also the last decent game Bethesda Game Studios produced and well over a decade ago now. If you've never played it, it's a no brainer. You might want some mods to bring the visuals up to date, but there's no denying the vast amount of content it offers. It just feels like with a little more skill and ambition that another dev team could have really elevated this.
