Being in the gaming world since my very first breath 36+ years ago, I have seen many games come and go, each leaving an indelible mark on my soul. Today, though, I wish to share with you a tale interwoven with drama, emotion, and resilience as I dive deep into this game that echoes a fragment of my life.\n\nThe world of Botanicula is rich with vibrancy, mirroring the colorful tapestry of emotions I've been grappling with since my teenage years. The five botanical creatures, each with their unique quirks, were reminiscent of different aspects of my being. From Mr. Lantern's glowing demeanor, which often reflected the occasional spark of hope that I felt in my most depressive moments, to Mr. Twig's multi-armed reach, akin to my many attempts to grasp happiness in a maze of toxicity.\n\nVenturing through the game, it was almost therapeutic. Each puzzle I unlocked and every tiny creature I interacted with became symbolic of the intricate relationships and challenges I've encountered. The easter eggs were delightful surprises, much like those rare moments when the cold exterior of my world would melt away to reveal a glimmer of warmth.\n\nWhile many might say this is just a game, to me, Botanicula was a story of companionship, courage, and survival - emotions I am all too familiar with. The little mushroom's ability to clone herself spoke to the masks I wear daily, hiding my true self from the cruelty of the world. Mr. Poppyhead, robust and unwavering, reminded me of those few, steadfast friends who stood by me amidst my many toxic relationships.\n\nThe soundtrack is a medley of emotions. Every tune and sound effect resonated with the depths of my being, invoking both joy and melancholy. Just as the music by DVA brought life to the game, the memories and moments of my journey found expression in the ebb and flow of these melodies.\n\nHaving played many adventure games, Botanicula stands out not just for its intricate design and gameplay, but for the emotional odyssey it offers. It's a celebration of life, friendship, and resilience. I've found solace and a reflection of my struggles within this game. The very essence of the game can be summed up in a phrase: battling darkness with the glow of hope and camaraderie.\n\nWhile the game provides a rich sensory experience, the lack of replay value is something the developers could ponder upon. However, the overall storytelling, design, and music are an ode to creativity, making it a masterpiece in its genre.\n\nNavigating the game world of Botanicula was like traversing through the layers of my life, unearthing memories, pain, and the few moments of joy. As Kiba Snowpaw, an ice wolf forever battling the cold winds of loneliness and depression, I'd highly recommend this game to those looking to lose, and find, themselves in a magical realm. \ud83d\udc3e\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f\ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udda4\ud83c\udf0c", "timestamp_created": 1691950337, "timestamp_updated": 1691950337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144083782": {"recommendationid": "144083782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156525375", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1643645820}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83c\udf42\ud83d\udd77\ud83c\udf44\ud83e\udd9f", "timestamp_created": 1691926413, "timestamp_updated": 1691926413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144052500": {"recommendationid": "144052500", "author": {"steamid": "76561199526053940", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1691895417}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute, crazy and challenging (for me anyway).

I've played other games by Amanita, and really like them. This one, however, was a chore and an annoyance to get through!\n\nThis game is all out space logic! Not that all of Amanita Design's games are the most intuitive(yet even Samorost and Machinarium are better, despite being older), but they have certainly gotten better at it after this game! Sure, you can gleam some logic here and there, but for the most part this feels like an \"ADHD game\", where the game design seems to be \"how can we cram the most amount of randomness illogically into a couple of mouse clicks?\"\n\nThere are some neat puzzles, like the water drop and spoons puzzle. But then there are other times where you use gameplay features that have not been established, and is only used once, like one where you have to not only click, but click *and hold down* the button to \"charge up\" a creature and make a big bubble. (Holding down the button like this having never been a thing before, and never really being a thing afterwards.) And clicking it normally makes tiny bubbles, so it looks like that's the function. Meanwhile, there's nothing to indicate you even need a bubble in the first place. This is absolutely terrible game design, and the game is filled with similar examples. It also contains pixel hunting of the kind I thought we'd got rid of in the 90s, and not just for the optional stuff, but even some \n\nThe game is very similar to Chuchel in art style and silliness, but Chuchel has good game design: Chuchel always cleverly teaches you the mechanics of the gameplay, almost without you noticing. Which makes sense, as Chuchel was made six years later than Botanicula, so the team has learned a lot since this game.\n\nBotanicula was also an assault on my hearing. This is probably more a preference thing than anything else, and it's not that the sound design or audio in general is bad, it's just way too much at so many points in the game. Now, I do actually have hypersensitivity to hearing, which probably adds to why this bothers me so, but I can't remember any other game ever that has had such an annoying audio design.\n\nI could write more criticism on the story and characters, which are fine, but there are certainly some flaws there as well. But I don't feel like getting more deep with this review. I'll just mention a couple of other annoyances: A lot of hotspots you need to interact with are so close to the top or bottom of the screen that you very often activate the UI, which then has to close for you to actually interact with the actual game again and click the hotspot you wanted. And the in game map is a joke, and is so useless that it's easier to memorize the level layout than decipher how the map works with the level.\n\nAll in all, I suggest getting just about any other Amanita game than this one.\n\n100% in about 6 infuriating hours.

Lo juego a ratos porque hay momentos que me quedo bloqueado. Pero hasta la fecha ha conseguido picarme la curiosidad.\n\nHe avanzado bastante y llegando al final hay una fase de disparo muy muy dificil. La mecanica es la siguiente: solo dispones de un disparo, que una vez realizado tienes que recargar haciendo clic sobre tu esfera. A continuacion colocas el cursor sobre el enemigo y sin ningun boton dispara automaticamente directo al enemigo. Hay enemigos peque\u00f1os que eliminas con un solo disparo y otros mayores que necesitan varios. Cual es el problema? los enemigos flojos y tu esfera son diminutos y no es nada facil colocar el cursor encima, ya que ellos van avanzando hacia ti y si se acercan demasiado mueres. Y en la tercera habitacion son muchisimos. Te pones de los nervios.\n\nTambien en el 4\u00ba cap. te tropiezas con una superficie bastante amplia y muy laberintica. Y el mapa no ayuda mucho que digamos ya que la simbologia no es muy inteligible.\n\nTengo que comentar que, por lo menos para mi, el juego tiene un fallo tecnico. En ocasiones el cursor desaparece por el morro, reapareciendo en la parte superior de la pantalla. Esto dificulta bastante la resolucion de algunos puzzles, como el del gusano que ha robado el sol.\nPerdon por el spoiler.\n\nPor lo demas el juego esta bastante bien. Graficos picasianos que imagino gustaran mucho a los peques. Banda sonora bien, con sonidos muy graciosos. Al igual que los personajes, muy iconicos. El argumento bueno tambien. Sin dialogos (no precisa traduccion) ya que todo se explica con dibujos y videos. Algunos puzzles son muy faciles y el resto tampoco tienen una dificultad excesiva, aunque los hay realmente absurdos. Casi todo se soluciona haciendo clic por todas partes, buscando las piezas que son interactivas.\n\nLo recomiendo si te gusta el genero. 7 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1684372870, "timestamp_updated": 1686885430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537037014961242676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138462087": {"recommendationid": "138462087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010752029", "num_games_owned": 1649, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1486362602}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l39FdDHyo_s", "timestamp_created": 1684371212, "timestamp_updated": 1684371212, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.340013504028320313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138345528": {"recommendationid": "138345528", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998220253", "num_games_owned": 527, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1682532998}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cute little atmospheric puzzle game.

Desde el primer momento, el juego atrae con su belleza y creatividad.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico del juego es simplemente impresionante, con detalles intrincados y un uso brillante del color. Los entornos est\u00e1n llenos de vida y texturas, con cada criatura y elemento del mundo dise\u00f1ado con cuidado y detalle.\n\nLa banda sonora del juego es igualmente impresionante. Con una mezcla de sonidos naturales, m\u00fasica relajante y melod\u00edas juguetonas, la m\u00fasica complementa perfectamente la experiencia del juego.\n\nPero lo que hace que Botanicula sea realmente especial es la interacci\u00f3n con el mundo. Los jugadores pueden explorar cada rinc\u00f3n del mundo del juego y descubrir cosas nuevas en cada esquina. Los personajes son divertidos y exc\u00e9ntricos.\n\nLa jugabilidad es en gran parte de exploraci\u00f3n y resoluci\u00f3n de puzles. Los jugadores deben recolectar objetos y usarlos de maneras ingeniosas para avanzar en el juego.

A team of five strange creatures face the threat and set out to save their world.\n[url] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863233805[/url]\n[b]The Famous Five[/b]\n\nI have absolutely no idea which insects or animals served as models here. I'm reminded of our five friends, um no, sorry, our heroes of a twig, a mushroom, something with a feather, maybe a beetle and some kind of hazelnut. But maybe they are something completely different. Who knows\u2026.\nBut exactly this motley bunch wants to survive against the parasites and plant the last seed?\n\nThe whole story is told completely without language and only with pictures. The control is also quite simple and so everything is controlled simply with the mouse in the simplest way and is therefore almost self-explanatory. [b]But despite this reduction, the game is anything but boring.[/b]\n\nFor me, the adventure, which is more like a bustling picture puzzle, is an audiovisual work of art in which many parts of the game don't even really belong to the mission and are just a gimmick. The entire world consists of scenes affecting all parts of a tree. From the roots down to the smallest leaf and the places you visit in the course of the game are actually not always really pretty or colorful and sometimes they seem rather repulsive.\nNevertheless, they are all extremely colorful and have their very own charm. In addition, there is the atmospheric music, or let's call it a collection of various sounds and noises by the band Dva, which isn't really nice either (no, not the band, I mean the music), let alone can be classified somewhere concrete.\n[url] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863233602[/url]\nBut that's exactly what the two band members wanted, because their music often comes from everyday sounds or self-made instruments, which all in all creates a unique and yet well-composed masterpiece.\n\n[b]But of course an adventure also includes tasks. [/b]\nThe tasks usually consist of finding one or more objects and using them in other places.\nFinding is less of a problem here. The question often arises as to how to find the actual solution or how to manipulate the game world in such a way that our dream team can get the required object.\nOnce you have found out what is helpful for progress, the only question that remains is what exactly to do with it. Drag, click or something completely different?\n\nAnd this is where The Famous Five come into play again because they are always part of the puzzle solution.\nEach of the five has different special abilities that sometimes even have to be combined. From time to time, however, only one of the five can pass the task and if you don't choose the right one right away and mess up the task, you get to see a funny animation and can try your luck again.\nBut even here, the often annoying trial and error becomes fun and not a frustrating task.\n\nAnd sometimes it seems that all this is not quite optimal, but the game is still structured so logically that everything fits together in the end.\nWhat Botanicula shines with once again are all the fantastic little mini-games, such as a kind of labyrinth that is somewhat reminiscent of the game \"the buzz wire\", smaller shooter sequences or races and the whole creativity behind it is absolutely fascinating.\n\nEven if the game is different, but still uses many well-known elements, the way it is so unusual that it may be, will be or could be too strenuous for one or the other.\n\nNevertheless, Botanicula is a game that is definitely suitable for all ages, precisely because the presentation is more like an interactive picture book and can be discovered without any language.\nOne or the other riddle may be a little harder, but maybe it's only because adults often don't think of unconventional and obvious solutions.\n\nCharacters don't evolve over the course of the game. As well as.\nIt's a bit difficult without language and in-depth history.\nNevertheless, the game brings an atmosphere that you really rarely experience, which is certainly due to the design. The graphics themselves, in terms of design, are beyond criticism in my opinion.\n\nBotanicula is not the big adventure, not even for the head.\nThe puzzles are just too transparent for that. But the special thing about it is discovering and \u201ctouching\u201d.\nEverything reacts to the movement of the mouse and sometimes you have to guess whether you have to click, drag or press to get to your destination.\n\nFriends of the demanding combination puzzles will be absolutely underchallenged here and somehow then also with the wrong game. The solutions to many puzzles are simply too banal or even arbitrary for that.\n\nAmanita Design is known for its comical games, but comical here means different, fun, and definitely remarkable.\nAnd the games are always different, because these curiosities, the different and imaginative worlds with the successful interplay of graphics and soundscape impress across the board.\n\n[b]Anyone who likes the games from Amanita Design and knows and loves the Samorost series will certainly feel at home here.[/b]\n\nReview date: November 09, 2022\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]MY PROS AND CONS:[/b]\n\n\u2714 Unusual adventure\n\u2714 great atmosphere\n\u2714 great sound / background noise\n\u2714 lots to discover\n\u2714 living game world\n\n\u2718 fixed resolution\n\n[hr][/hr][b] PLAYED WITH: \ud83d\uddb1\ufe0f [/b]\n[hr][/hr]\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42616051/][b] \u2ba9 VISIT ME IN MY LITTLE WORLD[/b][/url]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[url] https://store.steampowered.com/app/207690[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1667994413, "timestamp_updated": 1667997355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792907059192657471", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125168194": {"recommendationid": "125168194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198962854741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1667936867}, "language": "english", "review": "\nit's a part of my childhood and how nice it was to come back and play a game that I used to spend hours on.

As I prize myself to be quite the hardcore adventure gamer and having come to love Amanita Design through its wonderful, rusty and melancholic Machinarium, I was expecting Botanicula to be a game in the same trend of witty puzzles and shaking emotion. \nAnd indeed, when it comes to emotion, Botanicula never fails to deliver. The main characters are memorable, the art style surprisingly beautiful in its simplicity - it looks as if the producers have stolen some doodles from a kindergarden drawing session and have infused those scribbles with divine breath. The result is unforgettable. Combined with the playful music (which is sometimes veeeeery close to annoying but never quite passes that borderline) this makes Botanicula one of the most expressive games ever. It is amazing how little is needed to masterfully tell a story which goes deeper then even most triple A titles. I can't thus shake a peculiar feeling, as if I'm watching a cubist piece of art and I'm not sure if I should take it as it is, or dig deeper for hidden meanings and risk ruining the actual artistic message.\nWhen it comes to puzzles though, to understand Botanicula one must turn to the developer's website and READ THE SMALL PRINT: Botanicula is not a proper adventure game, but a point-and-click EXPLORATION game. Of course I myself, with the characteristic modern impatience, totally ignored this difference in nuance in the beginning and found myself (or rather my neurons) deeply disappointed. The game is rarely brain teasing and limits itself to encouraging spam-clicking all over the screen to discover the lush, green micro-universe. Some of the puzzles don't even make sense, or rather suggest that this botanical word has rules which rarely respect the physical world logic. Some puzzles are obviously developed with handheld touch screen devices in mind and feel kind of clunky with the mouse. \nBut if you're ready to slow down, accept this wacky universe and witness it as a perpetual celebration of life over death and decay, you'll be facing one of the most artsy and good-taste games ever. So wipe the ADVENTURE game pattern from your mind and prepare to embrace a new kind of experience...

Really enjoyed this!  Well-made and well thought out point-and-click. A little group of creature friends travel together around a big tree, keeping out of the way of threatening spiders and such, going on side quests finding things and helping other creatures.  Lots of little mini-games where you often have to squeeze your brain a bit to figure out what the goal is or the solution to get there. Colourful, fun, rewards curiosity and exploration.\n\nThere's a map, which shows new areas as you explore them. Lots of achievements for all kinds of things, silly, helpful, curious, etc. - and a neat achievement overview in top screen margin. Also a useful quest/item counter. \n\nThe group of friends travel together, sometimes dividing up different tasks in quests or difficult situations according to their particular characteristics (long, thin, flying, heavy...). But not rpg.\n\nNo platforming. A couple of the minigames in the first chapters are arcadish and timed, but most aren't. For someone like myself who has slow reflexes, gnarly hands, and very simple gear - I found that up to the last chapter there were altogether a handful of minigames I had some trouble with, and one in particular that was very tightly timed where you're being chased in a labyrinth and which I found very frustrating.  \n\nUp to the start of the final chapter the mood of the game is quite light - a couple of cartoonish scares where paths forward are blocked by an angry spider or beetle or such, but quite low key.  Nothing unkind or cruel.  And the general tone bright and cheerful.\n\nHowever, in the end of the last chapter (underwater region), the mood of the game turns a lot darker and tense and would likely be scary for smaller children. And uncomfortable for people with arachnophobia. In this final section there is also some quite difficult arcade-type gameplay requiring fast and precise clicking to get through. I am very very bad at arcade, and would never have managed this section just with my standard non-gaming mouse. Had to switch to pad mode and use touchscreen to get through it.\n\nSaving worked fine, autosaves on exit, plus manual saves. Menu and controls are fine.  Encountered a few minor glitches couple of places, but nothing serious or gamebreaking (reloading solved all). No other issues. Worked smooth on my very basic gear, kb+m.

A lot of the time you simply click on stuff and see what happens. Nature often plays a part and words like \u201cadorable\u201d or \u201ccute\u201d easily comes to mind while playing. [i]Botanicula[/i] is no different: everything is as adorable and whimsical as ever. There\u2019s also a lot of extras to discover and activate.\n\nThe story isn\u2019t trying for anything particularly profound or life-changing, but it doesn\u2019t have to and gets the job done quite competently. If you are into having your mind bent and can\u2019t have it any other way, this is probably not the game for you. Everyone else will love it.\n\nThe music is sort of a mix between Steve Reich, Meredith Monk, and Dvar in their lightest, most playful moments, and also sometimes interactive. The sound design is great and sets a perfect tone for the game. The puzzles are well integrated with the surroundings and often consists of bridging a gap, climbing something, or finding a most needed object by interacting with the environment or the NPCs, and choosing which of your characters to use\u2014as they come with different skills.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun game which I think could easily draw a smile from even the stiffest, most determined grumpy old fart. If you are still not liking it, then being a kid\u2014either by heart or by design\u2014might help. It\u2019s a perfect fit for when you need a break, but don\u2019t want to, or cannot, leave your computer.\n\nFull review:\nhttps://maskinkultur.com/2018/04/10/review-botanicula/", "timestamp_created": 1652435031, "timestamp_updated": 1652435055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522293031215667725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115148253": {"recommendationid": "115148253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041184443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 618, "last_played": 1577018461}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful graphics, fun and varying puzzles with beautiful sound effects and music.

I found myself constantly re-clicking on some things that made a hilarious sound.\nThe story is wonderful, told well through the game's actions. There's no understandable words in it (just cute mutterings), but everything is explained as you go via visual stories. I got right into it, thoroughly enjoyed it. You can tell this game was made with a lot of love.\n\nDefinitely a game for the young and old. If you enjoy the simpler types of games, I recommend giving this one a go.

I dismissed it originally cause it seemed a bit too simple and sappy compared to other Amanita games but it turned out to be quite the opposite.\nAt the core Botanicula is like a little fairy tale. You control a group of tiny creatures of varied build and purpose and explore a giant living tree and meet the other living things that inhabit it until spider like creatures start sucking out life and chasing you down. So now you set out on a journey to save your habitat from this menace. It's very simple but told well and with a surprising amount of depth. They even created a coherent little mythology and a prophecy that you follow without using a single word.\nThe exploration part of the game is extremely well fleshed out to a point where I'd consider it the most fun part of the game. Just going around and clicking on everything and seeing what happens is fun, I loved meeting new things and seeing what they do and how they tie into this whole ecosystem the game slowly builds up. The sound design supports it as well cause everything you do and everything you meet has its own voice that often ties into the background music. \n\nWhen it comes to gameplay there's very little challenge. I think the intention was to engage you in this adventure without necessarily making the player sit on one screen and bust their brains to figure out the solution to puzzles. As such you'll usually be able to recognize solutions at a glance and always have an idea of what you need to do.

Much like Amanita Design's previous work, the strength of its environmental adventure is through its zany non-verbal characters, This includes the five protagonists, whom are trying to save the last seed of their home tree from parasitic creatures, and the plethora of fauna they encounter along the way. Each one entirely interactable, either granting the player a valuable item to be used later or simply just to provide some weird nonsensical humour. It supplies the point-and-click quest with an abundance of charm, character and charisma that differentiates itself from other similar titles.\n+ A luscious tree brought to life. Amanita's art direction for Botanicula settles for the simplistic, embodying the type of style that was prevalent within browser games of the late noughties, but retains its aesthetic throughout. Considering it was created on Adobe Flash, the design work really shines through. Clear prompts are given as to which direction the botanical protagonists can travel in. Items are importance are highlighted for the player to collect. The wildlife, both in the background and foreground, match the environment that they reside in. Botanicula truly felt like an ecosystem of its own.\n+ Hum-hum-hummm-hum. Much of the charm comes from the sound editing and score. With no verbal communication, the characters communicate through mumbles and whistles, which in turn generates a thought bubble for the player to visualise. Hearing a \"Yee-hoo\" will indicate a positive outcome, and these signals help enhance that required accessibility for younger players.\n\nWHAT I DISLIKED:\n- As mentioned, Botanicula plays well for the younger demographic. Adults and/or players who are familiar with point-and-click adventures will find this game far too easy. The puzzles and environmental obstacles on offer could easily be accomplished without a hesitation. Guiding a star through a maze whilst it's being chased by a worm? Simple. Racing ladybugs around a leaf? Done. The lack of challenges makes Botanicula a breeze to complete, with only the familiarisation of each level being the trickiest aspect (although a map is accessible...).\n- Save the home tree again? Doubtful. Only a select few point-and-click adventures have replay value, unfortunately Botanicula has none. Once the botanical beings have banished the parasites for good, the game simply ends and can be played again from the start. No chapter select. Easter Eggs can be unlocked if the player interacts with a certain number of creatures, but the reward for doing such a task seems fruitless.\n\nVERDICT:\n6/10 botanical organisms", "timestamp_created": 1603980551, "timestamp_updated": 1603980551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598091959953308105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78134806": {"recommendationid": "78134806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163890648", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1645206976}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, it always puts me in a childlike mindset of curious exploration and wonderment :)\nAlso stunning music, \"voices\" and artwork.", "timestamp_created": 1603637380, "timestamp_updated": 1603637380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539295375347137451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78040772": {"recommendationid": "78040772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209837145", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1512158426}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the aesthetics!

It's kind of a mixed bag. What I mean is, say in a game you have 4 doors. You go into door 1, and it takes you to a sunset. You go into door 2, and it takes you to a forest. When you go back to door 1, it may not take you back to the sunset. The pattern of where you go isn't necessarily absolute on which door you enter. There was one part like that (not with doors). That's why I think little kids might have trouble figuring out the mechanics at the more difficult parts. It does require a little bit of creativity to click and explore and ponder how, or if, you can use various objects and characters to your advantage.\n\nI liked it and found it very relaxing to play after work. \n\nI'm not sure I completely understood the story and what happened, but I know I won! I recommend it if you like casual semi-puzzle games. I say semi-puzzle because a portion of the gameplay is discovery by clicking to see what happens.", "timestamp_created": 1593724675, "timestamp_updated": 1593724791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639523923397064209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71843614": {"recommendationid": "71843614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115526261", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1618071010}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego de estucia y divertido,en algunas parte me ha pasado de no saber que hacer pensando que ya habia hecho todo pero no! ahi esta el verdadero reto, saber que falto! aun asi amo los videos que aparecen para contarte la historia en momentos que vas avanzando de nivel- adem\u00e1s de tener una excelente visual y sonidos muy buenos! \nAMO EL DISE\u00d1O- AMO AMANDITA DESIGN \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1593650234, "timestamp_updated": 1619276850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71772661": {"recommendationid": "71772661", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995383331", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1529187359}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juegeo es incr\u00e9bile, realmente simp\u00e1tico, entra\u00f1able y novedoso, en un g\u00e9nero en que parece dificil innovar este juego consigue, con mucha sencillez un aire de frescura.", "timestamp_created": 1593566700, "timestamp_updated": 1593566700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71687648": {"recommendationid": "71687648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198963344703", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1593467915}, "language": "english", "review": "its a great indie game, you dont really need a mouse and only takes about 3-5 hours to complete", "timestamp_created": 1593469945, "timestamp_updated": 1593469945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71638840": {"recommendationid": "71638840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357021052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1593540568}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played Botanicula last time about seven year ago and I must say that this game is still good.

No text - all information is conveyed visually. Though much of the game is green on green, it's also gently outlined in white, so may still be playable by colorblind folks.

This game stands out from other point and click adventures due to its art style of which the trailers and store page pictures give you a good idea.\n\nThe game has a very quirky-silly style and sense of humor. Expect to find references to rocket ships and aliens, for pictures of the creators to pop up, for creatures to be flung off screen with a *boing* sound effect. If you like that sort of thing, this game does it well. The art is unique and gives the game a whimsical vibe. All positives, again, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nBut the game has some serious flaws. The game can be hard to navigate at times. Some levels have a maze like construction and you can get lost or forget where things are despite a map. The level layout just isn't very intuitive. And while most puzzles are make enough sense, some don't seem to follow logic much, \n\nAlso, and this will be a big problem for a lot of people, there is no story. You get cutscenes of wordless story telling, of some bad spider things going around doing bad things, and about some good glowing seed from the heavens... but that is it. You learn nothing about the group of creatures you play, nothing about the various societies and people you interact with, nothing about the bad spiders or glowy seed... just nothing. \n\nIn the end though I can recommend this game for its style.

Over the course of the game you will collect objects which are given to various characters who reward you with items needed to advance.  \n\nThere are 6 levels, each is pretty short, but there are dozens of insects that can be interacted with, usually with a simple mouse click.  I know what you're thinking, \"clicking stuff is boring\".  I'd usually agree, but the animations and discovery of the hidden bugs is enjoyable.  Clicking on a bug may cause it to hide behind a leaf, clicking the leaf will cause the bug to move again.

I\u2019ll try to explain why.\n\nI don\u2019t mind the abstractness of it all, but the interactivity (or lack thereof) is what bothers me. You start out just randomly clicking some bulbs and then suddenly a weird arachnid-looking creature comes over and starts poking things. First of all, not going to lie, the creature itself was a little bit unsettling. Then my instincts scream at me \u201cclick on it! click on it!\u201d so I do, but nothing happens. The rest of the (very little) time I spent on Botanicula, felt like watching a weird fairytale film while on drugs. I\u2019ve never been on drugs, but I\u2019m sure it looks and feels exactly like this.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know what the goal of the game is, what I\u2019m supposed to do or when I\u2019m supposed to click and on what, and that frustrates me a lot. I like being in control and this game takes that away. The music adds to that \u201con edge\u201d feeling the game gives you. Again, that is probably perfect for some or even many people, and if you are like that, I\u2019d recommend this game as it is overwhelmingly surprising and weird.

The story itself is also very engaging and a sort of \"figure it out as you go\" kind of experience, where the more you play the more you find out about the world of Botanicula.\n\nwith mind bending puzzles and a genuinely charming story and cast of characters, there is nothing to dislike about this game", "timestamp_created": 1577725430, "timestamp_updated": 1577725430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57924264669418335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60824032": {"recommendationid": "60824032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302844596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 710, "last_played": 1530561214}, "language": "english", "review": "Elegant, funny, entertaining...", "timestamp_created": 1577616254, "timestamp_updated": 1577616254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60820874": {"recommendationid": "60820874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027361060", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1577612584}, "language": "english", "review": "It's very cute and charming.

Este era uno de los pocos juegos de ellos que me faltaba por probar, y al igual que como me ha pasado con todos, me ha encantado.\n\nAl igual que algunos de sus otras sagas, Botanicula es un juego que mezcla una especie de \"point & click\" con \"puzzles\". La idea es ir interactuando con todo lo que te d\u00e9 curiosidad y utilizar tu intuici\u00f3n para ir resolviendo los problemas que se te presentan. Su gameplay es sencillo y muy intuitivo. Su apartado gr\u00e1fico es, como siempre, simple pero detallado en cantidades iguales, y con una creatividad desbordante. La banda sonora no es la gran cosa pero va muy acorde al apartado visual, y los efectos sonoros de los personas y el ambiente tambi\u00e9n.\n\nPros:\n- Buen dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico.\n- Ambientaci\u00f3n muy carism\u00e1tica y \u00fanica.\n- Banda sonora decente.\n- Gameplay sencillo.\n\nContras:\n- En teor\u00eda ninguno, excepto quiz\u00e1s que el juego realmente es corto y carece de una real rejugabilidad (a menos que desees tener todos los logros), lo cual a algunas personas puedes dejarle un \"gusto a poco\".\n\nConclusi\u00f3n:\nEl juego es corto, intuitivo, divertido y carism\u00e1tico, como todos los juegos de Amanita Design.

Unfortunately, their different characteristics are rarely used jointly or even in a reliably predictable manner. It is mostly a matter of picking the right one for the job, often trying out each one anyway to observe their silly antics, but there's hardly any cooperation to make interactions rewarding.\n\nMost puzzles are simple point and click fare, except in rare situations where items must be dragged or pushed. These obscure control exceptions feel moderately awkward. My sheep got stuck in one scene and no amount of clicking or dragging or swearing would fix the problem until I exited the area and reloaded. Controlling my character in the underwater swimming bit also felt weirdly unnatural.\n\nThe flat representation of the scenery somehow makes it is easy to get lost, despite the inclusion of a self-revealing map that proves almost entirely useless. I found the scenes lacked connection at times.\n\nThe game trades the textured earthy look of other Amanita games for flat pastel shaded artwork with white outlines. The game's art direction simply did not resonate with me at all compared to the amazingly detailed microcosms of Machinarium and Samorost.\n\nThe game renders all its goofy environments and fast-paced cutscenes over a tiny portion of a standard PC monitor. Even at max settings, there is a disconcertingly thick black border around all sides of the screen, and no option to scale up the image.\n\nCollect creature cards by interacting with the world and its myriad of insect-like characters. Earn a few tiny animated rewards at the end of the game based on your collection's completion level.\n\nAt times aurally brilliant, at times annoying, the audio is a bit of a mixed bag. Some of the songs are incredibly beautiful while others are beyond grating.\n\n[h1]Positive[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Imaginative design still procures glimpses of the genius of other Amanita titles\n[*] Silly humour and charming critters\n[*] Tons of little things to try and discover\n[*] Audio is both a hit and a miss\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Negative[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Art style and execution way below other Amanita titles\n[*] Black borders, does not use full screen space\n[*] Final chapter is pitch black for the most part\n[*] End action sequence and frantic clicking feels out of place\n[*] Confusing and useless map\n[*] Flash engine is showing its age poorly\n[*] Audio is both a hit and a miss\n[*] Occasionally awkward character controls\n[/list]\n\nI reluctantly bought this one on a sale after years of hesitation, thinking I might like it anyway despite my first impressions since I first became aware of this game. I hoped to be delighted and surprised but the game's usurped charm did not warm my thick black heart.

They go to save their world from some sort of hostile black spiders sucking the life out of plants. In order to do that, they need to solve puzzles and find a variety of items along the way.\n\nIt is a very universal game. There is practically no text outside of the menu, not even some text explaing what you should do, how the game works or what characters say. But the best thing is: Everything comes clear quite quickly.\nIn the beginning it might be confusing, especially with those level structures, but you'll get the picture very soon by just trying out and exploring. And you will not lose your current tasks out of sight since they are displayed in a certain corner of the screen.\n\nAs for gameplay, you will mostly use your mouse, the game's controlled pretty much like a point & click game. It's easy to learn.\nAlso, you cannot die or read \"Game over\" ever. So failure is not a big deal if you're figuring out the solution of a puzzle or face aggressive creatures.\n\nThe graphics and music are great.

One day, this tree starts being attacked by some parasites that drain it (and its inhabitants) of life, killing everything in their path. It's up to this group of friends to save the last seed of the tree, and protect it from the parasites. Along the way you'll come across many different creatures that also live in the tree, and you can interact with almost everything; even when in some cases it's not necessary to move forward the plot, you can still watch a fun little scene.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. Like I already mentioned, it's a point-and-click game, meaning you'll be exploring different screens and solving puzzles by looking for different objects and such. The game itself is divided into 6 chapters, and in each of the chapters you need to collect a certain number of items before proceeding to the next one. Said objects are scattered across the level, and in most cases you need to solve a puzzle before obtaining them, but I wouldn't say it's very difficult. Not that it's something bad, since this is a game that anybody can play, from small children to adults.\n\nThe art style is very unique, and it's hard for me to actually describe it, but I'd say it fits the game pretty well, as all the different characters and environments have their own quirks to them. The soundtrack is also pretty good, but once again, it's hard for me to give an accurate description.\n\nOverall, Botanicula is a fairly enjoyable game, I recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1525118244, "timestamp_updated": 1525118244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626004040241241455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41723017": {"recommendationid": "41723017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164597016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1499402798}, "language": "english", "review": "Too simple, too childish.

Keep an eye on this one during sales and give it a go.\n\n[quote=Crimson-Albedo]Follow my reviews through my curator at [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32482033/]Crim's Humble Opinion[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1521732849, "timestamp_updated": 1522771343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670315563678741455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40946392": {"recommendationid": "40946392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358712199", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1678026540}, "language": "english", "review": "Botanicula is a rare game.

However, these are far and few in between, so it shouldn't be a major annoyance, just a small nitpick. \n\nA few more of the drawbacks include: the game being too short, (you can finish it in one sitting if you so pleased), and the story isn't really deep and intricate. Though, overlooking these problems is easy as you dive deeper into the beautiful style, and the (sometimes) funny and (for lack of a better word) adorable animations.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do in this game seek out, and collect all of the 'animated cards'. The characters are lovable, even without the use of words; the art style and music are beautiful and well executed.

And that's fine: just click and push and pull anything that can be touched.\nI eventually had to consult a cheat sheet because I was stuck and wanted to avoid spoiling this for myself with needless frustration. (Something I thought could only be clicked turned out to be pull-able.)\n\nAside from aiding our heroes on their important quest, the goal here appears to consist in collecting as many creature cards as possible.

The seeds you control as well as the myriad strange creatures you encounter all have distinct and unique personalities that burst through their designs. \nThe audio is truly delightful, with sharp changes in sound as you enter new areas, and not to mention the amusing noises you will hear upon interacting in various ways.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fluid and smooth, the game works very well as a point n click adventure and the animations integrate seamlessly with the movement of the mouse. The puzzles themselves are not particularly difficult but do show some measure of increasing difficulty and near the end require you to recall a fair amount of information from the interconnected areas in order to succesfully solve them.

There is a bit of a more random element to this game compared to other point and click adventure games, but I still really enjoyed it. I liked collecting all the creature cards and looking at the art. It does not do anything, but it's an interesting and creative little feature. Be prepared to run around a lot in confusingly mapped out levels. I liked the level design because it is different, however, even with the mini map I did get lost a few times. \nI would recommend purchasing this game in a bundle or on sale since it does have a limited amount of playthrough, and is short. I finished it within six hours, but I am going to go back and get the rest of the achievements later so if you play games like me (extremely slowly) you will get your money's worth. One tip that might be obvious to other people but it took me a while to figure out is when you have an item in your inventory you can only apply it in the room it is supposed to be applied to. So, if you go to take it out of your inventory and it does not budge then you know it is not needed in that room. That feature definitely made figuring out the puzzles easier for me. \nIn conclusion, if you enjoy relaxing, atmospheric, slower-paced, random, point and click adventure games I would highly recommend.

Yes, as others have said, the visuals and sound are wonderful.  But, the game play is just silly.  In general, it consists of randomly clicking (or possibly dragging -- it's not obvious) on things on each screen a random number of times until a random and arbitrary thing results.  Randomly, you might have to repeat the above an arbitrary number of times until some other arbitrary things happen.  Also, be warned that you cannot go back to previous levels of the game without restarting.  So, if you manage to miss something optional (i.e., for an Achievement), happen to have everything necessary to finish the level, and click on the thing that finishes the level, you're SOL.  Using a walk-through, I managed to drag my way through level 4 of the game's 6 levels.  Looking at what was in level 5, I threw up my hands in disgust and quit (and I'm a completionist).

The biggest challenge in these usually comes from which mechanic to rely on (i.e. clicking on an item vs. clicking [i]near[/i] it vs. click-and-drag), but that doesn\u2019t detract too much from the game. Part of this may stem from the absence of dialogue and text, but I think it was the right stylistic choice to add to the game\u2019s charm.

Sometimes it's unclear what you're meant to be doing or where you're meant to go, but honestly, that doesn't matter overly. You will get there eventually.\n\nIt's the stuff that happens in-between that's the real journey. \n\nThe game brings quirkiness and thoughtfulness in an unconventional way. You'll be desperately clicking around the screen hoping for something to help you move along, and next thing you know, there's a bunch of lil scribbly doods singing the most beautiful melody you've ever heard. Bizarre, but so beautiful.\n\nThe music in this game really is the standout for me. It's atmospheric, it's invigorating and it takes your breath away sometimes. You end up just sitting wherever you are for a bit and listening cause it's super nice. Even if you're stuck for an hour and a half on something, it's completely tolerable. Please play with the sound on. I promise you, it's a beautiful experience.\n\nBotanicula has a good deal of replayability, as there's a lot of cool little achievements you can get. It'd be fun to like spend a day or so 100%ing this, as all achievements only require some particular clicking.\n\nOverall, this game is one of those games that everyone needs to try when they feel like disappearing irl for a few hours and leaving an everyday mindset.

I found both of these to be excellent; the music above all else. It's not something I would normally sit and listen to, but it's the perfect soundtrack for this game. I love the music and how it's used here.\n\nI played through the first four levels out of the game's entire six-level length, and while I could have played another hour or two and finished, I was not feeling any desire to keep going. The story is that you're trying to save a seed from some shadowy monsters that are pursuing you and sucking the life out of the tree and its inhabitants. The tree is big, compared to your characters, at least, who are a team of things like nuts and a mushroom, etc., who each occasionally use a unique talent to enable progress. Getting to the bottom of the tree to plant a seed seems to be the end goal, and honestly the plot doesn't seem like it's supposed to be the driving force here.\n\nThe gameplay mostly involves finding things on the screen to click and occasionally wiggle or pull the mouse around to obtain one of numerous objects you need to continue. I'm no stranger to point-and-click games. The Space Quest and Kings Quest series were some of my favorite games as a kid. However, though there are a few little changes in environment, one of the biggest problems with Botanicula is that all the environments feel at least a bit similar. In most adventure games, the environments tend to be widely varied, and I find it helps keep a game from getting boring. Many games benefit from this.\n\nOn the topic of the objects you have to obtain to progress, though...it's generally duplicate copies of the same item for an area. For instance, to complete level one, you need to find several bug-wing thingies. Then to beat level two, you need to find five keys. To beat level three, you need to find three missing children. Then to beat level four, you need to find [i]fourteen[/i] birds in a village on the tree consisting of a dozen or more little similar buildings. This became taxingly repetitious to me, and the puzzles became more and more obscure, with the 12+ buildings making it difficult to figure out if I was done or not with any given home.\n\nI eventually had to resort to a walkthrough and found several solutions which I am certain I never would have figured out on my own, because I believed I was done in those particular buildings, having already obtained birds or seemingly having already completed everything in the buildings that there was to partake in. Navigating the walkthrough was even hell, thanks to how many of these buildings there were to check out. When an adventure game taking a long time to solve part of it while using a walkthrough, there's an issue.\n\nWhen I saw/read that level 5 was labyrinthine, I called it quits. While the music and visuals are a treat, it's not enough of a treat for me to justify playing through more of this game. The 2 hours I played felt like 5 or more, which is not good. =/", "timestamp_created": 1502065107, "timestamp_updated": 1502065107, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581852853298187256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34051229": {"recommendationid": "34051229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177690431", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2552, "last_played": 1504454791}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing", "timestamp_created": 1501987612, "timestamp_updated": 1501987612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466101676225662231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34043934": {"recommendationid": "34043934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063385845", "num_games_owned": 1620, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1501955822}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a pleasant little experience.

This game kept a smile on my face throughout playing it, even getting a chuckle out of me at some points. The story is wordless and simple. That is appropriate, since a complex story would take away from the charm of the world. The sound effects given to each character combined with fun animation gives the creatures of Bontanicula their own voices and tiny story to tell. The creatures are fun to discover and click on, which the game encourages with a card collecting achievment system. As the game went on, I started to care less about the achievements and more about what cute animation would pop up when I clicked a leaf. \n\nThe puzzles are all based on these magical creatures, appropriatly starting simpler in the beginning and gradually progressing into more difficult tasks. With the fantastical nature of the game, some of the solutions are not always obvious, and took some clicking around the screen to figure out. I had to pull out a walkthrough during one point of the game, but that was after attempting the task multiple times. With a little thinking and lots of clicking, I was able to solve the rest of the puzzles. \n\nIf anyone is looking for a short puzzle game full of charming characters and creatures then Botanicula is a must have. While it's about a 3-4 hour play time, the $10 price tag is deserving due to the obvious time spent fleshing out the world and the creatures.

From Samorost's kooky cosmic critters to the pleasant rustbuckets of Machinarium, their games exude pure happiness in the form of upbeat gibberish, uncomplicated puzzles, and positive themes no matter how dark individual moments may get. Botanicula is another notch in this merry belt, one that has no trouble juggling goofy vignettes with existential threats.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a very nice tree, full of little bugs and sprouts and assorted critters. Some spidery thing showed up and started devouring it all with a sort of creeping darkness, and a small band of the aforementioned critters escape with the tree's last seed. Struggling to stay one step ahead of their monstrous adversary, the critters journey through a colorful arboreal world in search of a new home and a fresh start.\n\nWhat this actually means is you have five little dudes who roam around as a unit, following your clicks from screen to screen and interacting with the many living things of Botanicula's world. As an adventure game there's very little player input, relatively speaking. There's only left click (and on occasion mouse proximity has an effect) and only on specific points of interest like critters and items. You don't move your team directly, but rather click on arrows pointing to different areas.\n\nThese limitations actually serve to benefit the game, especially as the scope of the gameplay expands. Botanicula's world is strange and alien, and most of the puzzles wouldn't work at all if they required more exact input. Instead, you can just click on little creatures to make them fly or yell or burp, and as long as you do it at the right time or in the right order or at all, you can make progress. The scenes your clicks produce are so funny and heartwarming I doubt anyone will have a problem with relinquishing control for them. And then later in the game you'll get to pick specific critters on your team to do things, collect items to use in puzzles, and work through a few more nifty gimmicks.\n\nThe story is another strong point building on these basic mechanics, a remarkable feat given that it is told entirely without dialogue. The folks at Amanita have mastered the art of storytelling through action and expression and it does tremendous work here. All of the adorable denizens you meet speak in mumbly Sims-like chatter but get their points across through wild gesticulation and the occasional visual aid. This hands-off approach both heightens the impact of events (good and bad) when they occur, and also keeps the game feeling lighthearted and silly the rest of the time. You're also encouraged to experiment with everything you meet, because interacting with new critters earns you collectible cards that can score you extra scenes at the end of the game.\n\nYou'll experience the world of Botanicula through a mix of vector art and photoshopped works, a finely-blended style that gives everything just enough weight to seem real, without losing its fanciful, dreamlike energy. The peppy soundtrack follows suit with all sorts of cutely and folksy tunes to keep you engaged. The artistry on display here is rare and unique, and makes the game feel like a real treasure from its simple beginning to its unexpectedly epic conclusion. Botanicula makes another excellent entry in Amanita Design's lineup, and an unforgettable title for any fan of point-and-click adventures.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

You can tell a lot of love went into this game. One of the positives people put for this game is that the puzzles are challenging. This is true, and it can be a perk, but it is also where the game struggles the most. Some of the puzzles are mouse-only and require actually doing stuff, which seems both highly at odds with the 'take-your-time' puzzle style of the rest of the game and... not very good. To me this is a very strong game, but ultimately all it takes is one 'bad' puzzle to totally halt progression. And the thing is, any given level can be your 'bad' puzzle, and even if they're not brick walls, the sound effects are so in-your-face that even a temporary slow-down can be very off-putting and jarring.\n \nUltimately I REALLY want to like this game and recommend it, but a few bad puzzles make me unable to do so.", "timestamp_created": 1497775665, "timestamp_updated": 1497775665, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.424805730581283569", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32514174": {"recommendationid": "32514174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018857816", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1497725048}, "language": "english", "review": "Utterly delightful and enchanting little gem", "timestamp_created": 1497725094, "timestamp_updated": 1497725095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32500678": {"recommendationid": "32500678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052403529", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1497696132}, "language": "english", "review": "Botanicula is a game that really deserves all the positive reviews.\nIt\u00b4s a beautiful little point & click gem with an awesome storyline and super cute \"heroes\".\nSpecial highlights are the music and sounds as well as the fantastic drawings and scenery.\nThe puzzles vary in difficulty but the game is never unfair.\n\nFor all the achievement hunters: 100% can be done in a few hours, if you pay attention to all the small details.\nIf you miss out on something (or someone!) it\u00b4s no problem at all, because you can have a few savestates and just load the game at an earlier stage to complete everything.\n\nFor me Botanicula was a great joy since you can feel how much love and creativity the developers have put into it.\n\nJust buy it already!

The game is incredibly cute, with endearing collage-ish art and cute little sound effects that serve for the communication between the characters. Botanicula is noteworthy, like all of Amanita\u2019s games (or so I\u2019ve been told) for having no words, spoken or written, and still telling a compelling, coherent story.

Imaginative critters that are crosses between insects and plants essentially, but they're really hard to describe other than that, you just have to see them in action. You go through the game interacting with these critters, you play as a small team of 5 critters trying to save the \"critter tree\" from being drained of all life by black \"Zlo\" critters. Interacting with the area will introduce you to new critters who will help you progress. It's fun to see how creative the game designers got with the critters, all having their own signature sound effects that are sometimes quite humorous. The sound design is great in this respect, having hundreds of sounds between critters and many tunes that sound like the critters singing a ditty as a group. The area design is also quite varied, going from the canopy of the critter tree to a critter village to a branching cave of more gangled critters.\n\nThe game is short, but enjoyable all the way through. Puzzles aren't too obscure or confusing, it doesn't really have a hint system but it isn't too hard to figure out what to do. Very satisfying.

Nope, I'm certainly not patriot, but goddamn we can make some great games. Especially indie ones. Yes, Arma and Mafia is one thing, but Botanicula oh lord. \n\nAnother great example of game that is indie and truly is indie. I guess you know what indie game is suppose to mean and also you know that some games are \"indies\" just to cover the lack of quality.\n\nAnyway, Botanicula is truly beautiful. Basically it's for everybody but also not for everybody. When you check the images, you might say that you'd sit your child in front of that and that's game for children but it's only beacause of visuals, that might give you cartoon atmosphere, or something you've watched when you was 4 years old. But guess what, that's indie genre dudes.\n\nYou want to know how awesome Botanicula really is? Imagine some interactive picture of let's say forest. You can move your cursor whereever you want, and every object that you can see will act like that cursor is there and behave like it's there. So the leaves will move in the direction cursor went, small twigs too, nuts, chestnuts or other forest fruit. Simply said, like you was there.\n\nAudio is on whole another level. It was done just by two guys that goes by name DVA (Bara Kratochvil & Jan Kratochvil) and they just done their work perfectly. Amanita Designs, small czech independent studio lead by Jakub Dvorsky didn't just made Botanicula, they made their impact with Machinarium and Samorost series. With their skills, DVA duo and highly highly highly interactive enviroment they have created truly great indie gem.\n(Demo available - another bonus point)\n\n[b]Bonus Point: Czech Feeling[/b]\n[h1]Rating: 9/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1492081129, "timestamp_updated": 1492081129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769043624401092529", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31039356": {"recommendationid": "31039356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279309568", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1493496133}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like playing a bjork song.", "timestamp_created": 1491741240, "timestamp_updated": 1491741240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31011525": {"recommendationid": "31011525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042256885", "num_games_owned": 975, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1497668505}, "language": "english", "review": "Botanicula is a cute point and click puzzle game with beautiful music by DVA.

There's nothing really to be done but plant a new tree so life can begin anew!\n\nThe best I can describe this is a exploration, point and click. It's beautifully drawn, with strange and lively music. The sound effects from the things you click become part of the background music. There's no dialogue, and any directions are communicated through pictures or arrows, including the plot.\n\nThis is a game where you click around to figure out the next step, moving along through trial and error. The puzzles are generous, giving you infinite lives if you mess up. Not all the puzzles reset but most of them don't need to.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the difficulty ascension is a little awkward, going from easy, easy, much harder, ahh, WHOA, and easy-ish again. Levels four and five are the hardest and longest by far, and I had to look at guide to figure out a lot of the smaller details.\n\nBasically it went from having one step to take to get an item, to having a more Zelda-like approach with three or four steps. There wasn't much warning that this was going to happen.\n\nI'm not sure it's a \"humourous\" game but it made me smile in many places.

There were times I burst out laughing and other times I thought I must have taken drugs with my last cup of tea due to the wild and strange things happening in-game. At other times I just sat and enjoyed the beautiful relaxing ambience this game provides.  It is truly a game for everyone. There are puzzles in the game but they are not the focus. The point isn\u2019t to boggle the player\u2019s mind but to guide them to thoroughly explore this unique world while completing a number of small challenges and fetch quests along the way. If you are a completionist (like I am!) then there are over 100 creature cards to collect, which you do by completing some form of interaction with all the creatures you meet, be that helping them, scaring them away or simply clicking on every single one you can see (and some of the cards are really cute!).\n\nOverall: 9.5\n\nBotanicula is a really fun game with a fantastic aesthetic, brilliant creatures, beautiful music and tonnes of stunning places to explore. It\u2019s also a pretty short game so it doesn\u2019t  overstay its welcome and even really busy people can finish it.  With a wonderful surprise at every turn I couldn\u2019t recommend this game more!\n\nBreakdown\n\nAesthetic: 10/10\n\nDo I really need to say anything given the screenshots above? Amanita Design is also the developer of Machinarium and Samorost 3, and all their games come with the same unique, gorgeous and charming aesthetic. The way they animate all the little creatures is amazing and every screen brings you more and more beautiful designs.\n\nMusic & Sound: 10/10 \n\nI would buy Botanicula just for the soundtrack. The music is beautiful and relaxing, and suits the ambience of the game perfectly. There are a range of moods, from dramatic to soothing to upbeat and lively and no matter what is happening on-screen the accompanying music serves to increase the atmosphere and immersion. There are also hundreds of unique sound effects associated with the different creatures in this game that serve to highlight the different personalities of each despite the fact they never actually talk (see my characters section for more). This clever use of sound effects draws you in and makes the game even better.\n\nGame Play: 8/10\n\nOverall the game mechanics are very simple and there is little that could go wrong other than the usual annoyance that comes with all point & click games. When you have clicked everything on the screen and nothing at all happens you have to vent your frustration by finding the nearest guide, at which point you face-palm at how \u201cobvious\u201d the solution is. But that didn\u2019t happen that often in Botanicula so the pain was kept to a minimum.\n\nThe only other minor complaint I have is that I spent quite a lot of time getting lost despite the helpful little map leaf in the corner, although that might be due to my own incompetence more than anything else.\n\nCharacters: 10/10\n\nAnother characteristic of Amanita Design games is that their characters have a tendency not to speak, instead communicating via a series of incoherent sounds. This gets no complaints from me given most voice acting is horrendous and only decreases the player\u2019s immersion. The burbling noises made by all the creatures in Botanicula suit the game perfectly and make them all so lovable! It really is incredible how quickly you grow attached to all the various nuts, mushrooms and tiny creatures you encounter and they all have so much character. And anyway, as a biologist I feel I should point out that these little guys don\u2019t speak human language anyway and the idea of a grub with an American accent is just silly.\n\nBad points?\n\nThe game could do with more settings as the options menu is barely present, but apparently the game runs on almost anything so I guess it doesn\u2019t really need a lot of options.

They all sound muffed while talking to one another which so make you have to focus the thought bubble to understand what they say. It is fairly easy so no hard thinking required.\n\nThe five main characters are all unique with different abilities which you would need to think slightly which one would be the one to get the key items. Their characteristics are very fun to look at as it tells what the character likes and wishes.\n\nThe music is great and the story told is clear.

The colors are nice too.\n- You control a group of people? Objects? I don't know have to describe them. You control a group of nature heroes, and its funny to see them react to the environment. \n- I don't normally like when games have no spoken words, but in this case I think it worked. Nothing in this game talks, and its charming.\n- I enjoyed the music. There is just one part in the game where you control the instruments being played by two creatures, and its entertaining to hear the music develop.\n\nCons:\n- The controls (can I even call them controls, all you do is click on things) were very unclear. It was at times difficult to figure out how and when to click on something, even when I knew exactly what to do in that situation. That was annoying especially toward the end. There is a section where you have to get a light orb from a pod, and you have to click on the white arrows in a VERY specific way to get the orb. I knew exactly what I had to do, but I had to resort to a youtube video to figure out how to pass this part.\n- There is no way I found to make the game full screen, so I was playing with a black frame around the game. It was distracting.\n- Steam overlay wouldn't work while I played, so I was unable to see achievements when they popped up. I also had to alt tab to get to a browser.\n- When I completed the game, the main menu only gave me an option to play a new game, so I guess there is no way to go to specific chapters in the game. I hate when games do this.\n\nBotanicula is very bizarre and trippy which was nice to see. The story was very basic and was satisfying in the end.

Did i finish the game (YES/NO/Maybe in the future) and why.\n3. Pros/Cons.\n4. Final thoughts.\n5. Rating\n\nSo let's beggin...\n\n1. Game description:\n\nPoint and click adventure at it\u2019s finest. The team behind Machinarium did not disappoint. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, let\u2019s just say that without saying a word this game tells a better story than a lot of other games. \nThe atmosphere is brilliant. The sound and music mixes with the actions you take and on every screen there is something that you can do, even if it is not quest related. \n\n2. Did i finish the game? YES\n\nThe game is fairly short if you know what you are doing, however if you take your time to explore the environment and find all the hidden stuff it will take you a while. \nI will come back to this game one day to find the last hidden creature.\n\n\n3. Pros/Cons.\n\nPROS:\n- Beutiful visuals\n- Superb sound and music\n- Interesting story\n- Tons of hidden stuff to find and explore\n\nCONS:\n- None\n\n4. Final thoughts:\n\nJust get it! You won\u2019t be disappointed. Again HB manages to throw in a game that blows me away. This is one of those games you come home to after a hard day at work. Just sit down relax and get absorbed in the story and atmosphere. \n\n5.

Truth be told, I only bought it because the characters and art style looked super cute. I never really had any experience with point-and-click games - at least not in a long while - so this purchase was something of a risk for me. But, every risk has the possibility of becoming a sweetass reward, and, now that I've beaten the game, I can definitely consider my purchase of Botanicula to be just that. \n\nAs I've mentioned, the characters and art style are super cute, and they surely have enough charm to match its cuteness. I couldn't stop smiling and giggling throughout my 6 hour playthrough due to the oodles and oodles of OMGEVERYTHINGISSOCUTENESS. Like, if you wanna see what I'm talking about, watch this 27 second YouTube video I made of some singing frogs from the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLo49T7z-Jw\n\nSo, yeah: The game's as cute as a bug, and considering I have, like, 87 mental disorders involving the symptom depression, that's pretty important to me. But, what's also important to me is for there to be some sort of meaning to the game. Like, why are these bugs just going around talking to singing frogs and solving puzzles (more on the puzzles in a moment)? Well, the game does a really good job of explaining its story in a way that provides empathy for the characters' plight without using words to do so. Like, the game doesn't use any words at all. Everything is expressed using imagery and emotional gibberish; it's adorable and heart-touching at the same time. By the end of the game, I was so determined to help the buggos, that I didn't mind failing at puzzles again and again and again - so long as I knew that eventually I'd perservere, and Mr. Twig and his buddies would eventually be happy again!\n\nThe puzzles themselves are, well, they're certainly satisfying to solve! Just about every time you solve a puzzle, the characters go all \"YooHoo!\" and it's THE CUTEST THING EVER OMG! I'm normally pretty terrible at puzzles (I blame those aforementioned mental disorders), so I eventually needed a guide to help me through the game. However, one thing I did notice was that it was also pretty difficult to identify where exactly puzzles were supposed to be. Like, not just what you were supposed to do in a puzzle, but what exactly was a puzzle? Where to start a puzzle? Sometimes it was tough to just get started, and I feel like this might be a problem for more people than just myself, especially near the end of the game. There's this awfully mazy-like area, and it practically forces you to use a guide for at least some of it. For me this wasn't a really big deal, since I didn't really buy this game for its puzzles anyway, but I could definitely see some people becoming upset by this. \n\nSo, there ya have it: my feelings about this game. I'm sure you're all very scared now by all of this, but you shouldn't be scared of purchasing this game, at least not if you like cute things and puzzles. Very, very, very nice game, and I'm looking forward to playing the other games done by Amanita Design.\n\n<3\n\nPros:\n- Incredibly charming in every aspect possible\n- Clever storytelling that doesn't rely on words \n- Atmospheric soundtrack and sound effects\n- Interactive environment\n- Puzzles are generally satisfying to solve\n\nCons:\n- Easy to get lost\n- Puzzles are a little too difficult to identify sometimes", "timestamp_created": 1482802153, "timestamp_updated": 1482802380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28665064": {"recommendationid": "28665064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039405652", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1482745308}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a bit back and forth on this one.

I think this should never be in a point and click, even if I'm rewarded in between clicks with different animations. \n\nStill, I really like the overall feel, and think that in a sale it's worth the price.

This is one of those games whose charm lies in its simplicity and even a certain naivety, combined with excellent art-style.\n\nStoryline is fully revealed in the first minute of the game. Our brave heroes must save last tree seed from voracious spider-like parasites and... that is it. Well, on the way from the top of tree to its roots, heroes will visit quite strange, unexpected and unpredictable places. Here I must say that sometimes Botanicula seemed for me, well... too eclectic. The first part of the game has a beautiful and clearly defined style, but in the middle of the game appeared... inappropriate elements; for my taste, they just do not fit in original style.\n\nLast part of the game is excellent, it offers an impressive contrast with the beginning. Live intertwining branches, filled with sunlight and scurrying creatures, are replaced by dark and eerie domain of parasites. The tree is dying. I was deeply impressed by last scene... and inspired by hope. The idea is simple and clear: despite everything, do not despair.\n\nAs for the gameplay. It is very simple, puzzles are not difficult but well designed and interesting enough. There is almost no inventory management and, in my opinion, it is good, because I do not think that collecting weird stuff and guessing how all this junk should be used, is a necessary element of good game. There are some arcade mini-games, they are well designed and fits perfectly in the mood of the game.\n\nWorld of Botanicula is inhabited by a variety of strange creatures and I humbly advise you to not hurry. Explore the game, click everywhere and see what happens then. In many cases, your curiosity will be rewarded with short funny scene. Botanicula is filled with humor, this game is truly created with love.\n\nI really liked the soundtrack, this strange and charming melodies, filled with buzzing and other strange sounds, it creates a very special atmosphere. Great job!\n\nWell. I sincerely recommend Botanicula. Odd, touching, optimistic... that is it.

Two extremely long chapters hold back its final score though, as they just drag on for way too long.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nBefore Samorost 3, Botanicula was probably the longest Amanita Design game with its 4-6 hours of play time (as opposed to the 30-120 minutes we are used from them). It is also unique in their portfolio in the sense that it has a cohesive central plot line about a group of sentient plants and their journey along the branches of a life-giving, glowing tree. Their task is no smaller than saving the last seed of their tree from an evil light-eating spider-like monster and its numerous offspring.\nStill, at its core, it is a surrealist adventure, this time showcased in the many small sub-stories that form each chapter. If you are looking for all those unexplainable moments, like a random onion using a fishing rod to get a mount to ride on, you\u2019ll find those in abundance.\n\nWhile it was commendable that they tried to make a full-fledged adventure game, its size also presents a drawback. This is most notorious in the underground section, which is so full of running around that it gets actually boring. But I also could mention the city, where the usual voiceless and textless approach adds an unnecessary difficulty modifier to the often unexplained puzzles. Sometimes progress can be more of a question of luck than problem solving skills.\n\nWith all these put together, Botanicula is a strange beast, because I cannot recommend it for those who are not familiar with this studio\u2019s games.

With no dialogue other than sounds and grunts, the game manages to portray a story of despair & hope, longing & belonging and wonder at the vastness of everything. \n\nThe visuals are just sumptious.

In fact, the whole game makes you think outside of the normal challenges you find in most adventure games. They are clever and all very \"let's try this and see what happens\"  (e.g. if you touch this, what happens and how will that reaction help you).  The game sparked an intuitive exploration mode in me that I didn't know I had and I enjoyed every moment of wandering in its world and not just racing through it to find an ending.  \n\nA bonus for me is that this is not a violent game other than trying to do away with a bad spider.  This may sound like a lame plot to most hardcore game players who are used to destroying enemies, dominating warloads, and relying on magic and combat to find a just end for the hero.  It isn't.  The fact that the game can be totally interesting and thoughtful without those trappings makes the game magical. \n\nI hope the developers create more games like this.  Kudos!

This is similar to Machinarium which is developed by the same team. However, the setting is completely different. You follow a team of magical insects as they try to save their tree. \n\nOptionally, along the way you meet a host of magical insects whose mysteries you are encouraged to unravel and are rewarded with a card for your \"Bestiary\" collection. The cards are secondary though and merely there to represent that you have explored all the mysteries with that particular insect, and you can move on.\n\nThe mysteries themselves are hypothesis-oriented. You attempt various different experiments on that screen until eventually, you figure out how the magical insect operates. Unlike Machinarium, Botanicula has barely any item-collection oriented puzzles (and those it has are really obvious - as in an insect asking for a specific item), so most of the puzzles can be solved on the screen you are on. This lowers the scope of brute forcing and makes the actual puzzle solving a lot more enjoyable.

Everything about it takes me back to simpler times when I was so easily entertained. If you have any appreciation for a light-hearted point-and-click adventure, then you will greatly enjoy Botanicula. \n\nThe gameplay is entirely point-and-click. You will have to solve puzzles and complete fetch quests to progress through the story. Botanicula does a wonderful job of staying fresh through its visual and sound design--i never got tired of doing practically the same thing repeatedly. It also helps that Botanicula will probably only last you a few hours at most. It could have gotten tedious had it lasted much longer. The puzzles are never too difficult either. I had to look up solutions to a couple of parts but ended up kicking myself for not having the patience of figuring it out. The story is light, and is driven by the characters' actions. There is no dialogue whatsoever, rather any information regarding the story is told through pictures and short cutscenes. It's a cute element that suits the game.\n\nOne of Botanicula's greatest strengths is its visual design. The color palette really pops off the screen, and it adds to the effect when purposeful colorless segments come into play. The bright and joyful colors are complimented by jovial little characters that you control. Each of the characters in your group eventually play a significant role in puzzles throughout the game. While one of them is much more important than the others when it comes to the story, each character has a part to play. Besides the protagonists you control you'll come across several other botanical creatures you can interact with. Playing their little games or simply interacting with them earns you a card with said creature on it that you can collect. If you find them all you get a little bonus after the credits role! All these tiny creatures are diverse in design and range from adorable to mildly frightening. I had fun finding the rascals and discovering their quirks.  \n\nThe overall sound design goes hand in hand with the cute aesthetics. I found myself laughing out loud as I heard the silly sounds some of the creatures made. From speech to the sound of movement, everything was spot on to me. Even the darker, scary enemies were well done and felt intimidating in a game where I knew very well that I couldn't be harmed. The music isn't particularly memorable, but I never thought it was bad at any points either. I suppose it just gets the job done.\n\nI loved Botanicula. It's fun, adorable, heartwarming and if I ever have kids someday, I would love to play this with them.

And that\u2019s definitely to its favor.\n[i]Botanicula[/i] is a point-and-click adventure game about the faunal flora residents of a fantastical tree trying to stop a dark, arachnid-like entity from destroying everything they know. If it sounds strange already, then trust me when I say you don\u2019t know the half of it.\nTo begin, gameplay is standard to the genre; as the player, your job is to explore the grand extent of the tree from the dramatically miniscule perspective of your band of five oddball characters. In your adventuring, you are provided the opportunity to interact with nearly every aspect of your environment, collecting items, receiving and completing small quests and challenges, solving puzzles, and unraveling the simple and yet still fascinating narrative before you, often making use of the individual assets of your tiny arboreal team to do so, and all without the game ever uttering more than a few words of human speech in the process.\nUsing that as a steppingstone, I transition into aesthetics. The artwork is absolutely beautiful, reminiscent of the animated fair of Tim Burton. Yet, even as there is a bizarre and almost twisted nature to the visuals, the presentation remains almost perpetually lighthearted (most of the time). Nearly every aspect of the tree that the small band of main characters inhabits has a life of its own and each is immensely unique from one to the next (so much so, there\u2019s even a card-collecting mechanic within the game that showcases a solid plethora of these many faces whenever the player takes interest in looking back). Meanwhile, the main team itself is an odd collective of friends who, while not given heavy character development, are filled with heart and personality. Matching up with the strange visuals and dreamlike presentation is an almost unearthly soundtrack from Czech musical group DVA, who also aided in other aspects of the final product.\nAs I stated earlier, there is almost no true verbal dialogue outside of the intentionally indecipherable mumbles of its characters, and next to no text of any kind; the entirety of the story is recalled and played out on screen as if on a stage. Nevertheless, it is an engaging narrative, even as it is a simple one. In the end, the game isn\u2019t especially lengthy, nor is it predominantly difficult (I, considering myself a less impressive gamer, was able to complete it in right around 5 hours); additionally, like most games in its subset genre, it tends to be a casual experience without an exceptional abundance of high-velocity or high-intensity moments during play. Do any of these facts diminish the value of this game? My answer is an emphatic no. When approaching almost any artistic product\u2014be it a game, a song, a movie, or anything else\u2014it\u2019s important to remember that rarely, if ever, will a piece of art appeal to everyone; even the most popular or widely received products will have people who simply don\u2019t enjoy it the way others do, and this one is certainly not exempt by any means.\n[i]Botanicula[/i] is definitely a strange piece of work. It\u2019s a wild adventure that takes place almost entirely in a tree; it\u2019s a bizarre introduction to a lovable cast and a beautiful world; it\u2019s a story without many words, yet it is filled with all sorts of heart and humor [i](sometimes irreverent\u2014discerning gamers/parents, feel free to message me for more details)[/i]; it\u2019s a relatively calm, somewhat brief, light-hearted game that had me entranced, entertained, and engaged all the way through.\nTo sum it up shortly: it was pretty weird, and it was pretty awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1453632906, "timestamp_updated": 1453768758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523132860660552979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20709335": {"recommendationid": "20709335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009512332", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1467225678}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the game, really nice music and was playing it with a whole smile all the time.

Great music and the atmosphere and non-verbal story-telling is really cool, similar to Machinarium (same devs) as far as characters speaking through picture speech bubbles.

Mostly I was just clicking a bunch of stuff watching all kinds of weird (yet entertaining) things happen before it gave me whatever item I needed to proceed at the time. \n*It's very abstract (which I like) and not really as much of a little world that Machinarium was, having really randomness to the different places and organisms you meet. Which I think Machinarium is a better game overall, telling a more cohesive narrative versus this game's sort of child drawing story (that could be taken as a negative or a positive). \n*The game was really short. I have 2.7 hours on this game and that was with clicking on everything I could find, though I didn't quite 100% it but I wasn't far off. I had little to no problem with the \"puzzles\" so I went through it pretty fast but even someone getting stuck a lot, if that's even possible, would still beat it fairly quickly. I think $10 is a bit pricey for a game that has little replay value and is so short. \n\nIn summary, this was an enjoyable experience especially at first glance at how wildly out there it was. It's a very sort kid's dream and occasionally nightmare with how abstract it is. But it was very short.

For a game with not a single bit of English dialogue, it speaks volumes with the art style, soundtrack (which is phenomenal, by the way), and the movements and actions of each seedling. There's even a strange type of humor, unexplainable in words, that stems from the adorable personalities of the tiny creatures all throughout the game.

The objective of levels in levels is to collect objects to get back other objects, change zone or simply beat up spiders. All the actions are thus made with the mouse, both for moving and doing something in particular.\n\nThere are no dialogues. We make us the story understand with drawings or dreams\n\nBotanicula is not a really difficult game. Riddles will put only few problems to be resolved. About 3 or 4 hours are required to finish it.\n\nThe soundtrack is very pleasant, in particular all the small sound effects which stuff every level (in particular the little \"yippee\" of our little heroes each time a quest is successful).

It is a point-and-click style, casual adventure game that takes you on a wondrous ride through a microcosmic fantasy world inhabited by bugs and critters.  Any fan of point-and-click, adventure-puzzle games will likely enjoy the experience. \n\nThe best feature of this game is the overall charm inherent in its delivery.  The art style and the soundscape together create the alluring atmosphere of the game.  The simple story is told through animations and emotion-filled sounds rather than through text and dialogue.  Despite the simple storytelling mechanics, all the characters you play and those you meet are uniquely interesting and charming.\n\nThe actual gameplay requires you to progress the story by solving puzzles via interaction with the world around you.  It will be mostly trial and error; but nothing is too daunting.  I felt the puzzles were a good balance of tricky and sensible; but they are not all necessarily logical.  You will have to think about the puzzles in terms of the wacky game-world dynamics. \n\nThe game is rather short, even shorter if you rush through the main objectives.  It is more enjoyable (and still somewhat short) if you take the time to interact with everything and see what you can discover.  There are plenty of hidden \u201cEaster eggs\u201d and collectibles scattered throughout the game to cater to those who enjoy treasure hunts and achievements.\n\n[b]Botanicula[/b] is definitely a well-designed game that was created with love and care.  I recommend that any point-and-click, adventure-puzzle gamer considering trying it.  Its charm will cater to fans of the genre both young and old.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1435079186, "timestamp_updated": 1449516267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760561347007751465", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16648089": {"recommendationid": "16648089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190784337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1434802140}, "language": "english", "review": "Botanicula was a cute and fun game to play but \nway to short! :-)\n\nAnd unlike others I somehow didn't like the music \nthat much.

The art style is unique, the soundtrack is incredible, and the five playable characters have so much personality without actually saying a word.\n- I love how interactive this game is. Random bugs, plants, etc. can be clicked on and most give you achievements.\n- The storyline is well developed, as are the minor characters. This game is filled with little whimsical moments involving the littlest things \u2013 a spider hiding behind a leaf, eggs hatching.\n- Pretty sure I sat at my desk with this amazed expression on my face the whole time (the soundtrack gets to you, man!).\n\nCons:\n- While I played through this twice (once for story, once for achievements \u2013 I\u2019m not posting a review of anything until I 100% it), there is very little in the replay value aspect. Keep in mind if you play this that you should really pay attention and experience the story the first playthrough, because it won\u2019t be the same the next time.\n- The puzzles are very easy, which would make this a great game for younger children, but might become a bit boring for those who like a challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1428257677, "timestamp_updated": 1438429810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61538463830947876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15163357": {"recommendationid": "15163357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045517917", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 369, "last_played": 1419174055}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendad\u00edsimo sin duda alguna.

The last time I chiefed that keef I was at a party at some DJ's house and he was handing out joints to everyone because I guess that's how DJ's win friends and influence people. I hesitated, but being that everyone else was doing it and I had no real reason not to, I smoked the one he gave to me. \n\nWeed is really stong these days. I don't know if they still grow the dirt weed that I used to smoke in high school, but back in the day I could do bong rips until the sun went down and not really be any worse off, just really hungry and couch-locked. That joint the dude gave me - that one joint - had me laid out on the couch thinking that my heart was going to explode and wishing I had never gone to that party in the first place. After we all smoked our joints the DJ announced that it was time for a cigarette break and motioned us all to step outside because for some reason weed was ok to smoke  indoors, but tobacco was not. So I stood up to follow everyone outside and as soon as I got up, my vision went black and I passed out on the floor. Just, like, crumpled and fell down. No one cared. Absolutely no one gave a shit. Nobody ran to my side to see if I was okay, no one rolled me over to make sure I wouldn't vomit into my airway. Nothing. I came to a couple minutes later when everyone had finished smoking and these girls were just walking over me to get back inside and claim a spot in the comfortable chairs.\n\nA real friend - no, any decent human being - would have the compassion to check on the guy who just fell down and went unresponsive. And as unpleasant as that evening was, at least it taught me not to hang out with Ken and his DJ friend anymore.\n\nSO, this game may look cool, and have pretty colors and seem slighly reminiscent of Samorost, but the similarity ends there.

Along the ride one must solve puzzles using the different abilities of the 5 characters.\n\nThe main strength of the game is how beautiful the art is. Everything seems hand-drawn and the animations reflect that, sometimes making movements very cut-out-ish. The music and the sound effects both complement that with very natural sounding tunes (as in involving individual sounds and hums rather than just musical instruments) and cute sounds from the environment (for example, when many different-sized bugs start humming a specific sound, the largest ones obviously humming in deep basses).\n\nThe puzzles are relatively simple on average, yet some of the later ones prove to be more complicated than you might imagine for what may strike one as a kid's game. What is unique about Botanicula's puzzles is that it is fun to see what will happen if you click on the wrong character. One problem that I have with the characters though, is that they seem like one entity, meaning it is hard to differentiate them based on their personalities.\n\nThis brings me on to how short the game is. It arguably contains 5 areas, each one longer than the one before it (which makes sense because you are moving your way down the tree, where the branches are progressively longer). The objective is to pass an obstacle blocking your passage to the next area by solving puzzles in the current area. There are many optional puzzles and things to click on which add to the completion rate on a playthrough, which does give access to additional content near the end based on how high it is. Even with that the game feels like one that should be completed in one playthrough, and, just like most point & clicks, there is no replay value in the game unless one did not achieve 100% completion.\n\nAll in all, Botanicula offers a short, but very charming and beautifully simple experience.

There's so much to explore and it's all a surprise, beautiful, original --> I made so many screenshots! \n\nThe only bad experience I had with this game (but it can be considered my own fault), is that I've only used one save slot (yes save slots are used); if I'm not mistaken there are 6 slots that could be used for every level (start or whenever). I'd really recommend saving every start of a level in a different slot, because you might want to play a level again due to f.e. game achtievements; I took my time and played in 'relaxed' mode (of course this game is ideal for that), gaining 42/53 achievements. I only used 1 save slot and finally saved the beginning of the end. Now if I want to gain the remaining 11 achievements, I have to start all over again. But I'm lucky that this is such a great title and therefore could easily play this game again entirely. Maybe with friends & family (@ age >= 10, because of some nice puzzle challenge at times and the fact this game comes with a 'labyrinth'-touch).\n\n9/10 because I would have loved a chapter selection option a la Limbo style! \nA masterpiece, created with a small team of Indie developers.

It has an ecological message beneath it, there are very clear goodies and baddies, and while it does get a little more complex and tricky for youngsters as it goes on, mine was still entranced by the scenarios and characters, as we played together.\n\nTruly delightful. If you like games like Machinarium, Tiny Bang Story, or any point-and-click puzzle-solving games this is charming beyond words and the focus is more on discovery and the characters, rather than it being *too* tricky in the puzzles (it can still be challenging at times, but not frustratingly so).

The challenges are interesting, the characters are very charismatic, the story is fun and engaging!

The feeling is you are listening to a track of a movie or an experimental musician - for example, the March of the Penguins (with incredible track made by Emilie Simon), or some albuns of Bj\u00f6rk, or even a cheerful folk with life, child and funny at the same time.\n\npros:\n- Beautiful graphics;\n- Almost everything have interaction in the forest;\n- Has some easter eggs;\n- Humorous;\n- The music and sound effects.\n\nCons:\n- The game is delightfully short.

The thoroughly organic world and its inhabitants are highly imaginative, some even bizarre-looking and -sounding. Some players may consider it too succinct, or even more attuned toward children. The simple story, though solid and sweet, does not require heavy ruminations \u2013 this is a game of the senses, pure and simple. You control a group of four friends on a mission to plant a seed. The main goal on each level progresses you to the next level; the puzzles are intuitive. The price of the game, whether regular or on sale, is appropriate. Yes, it is a Flash game. (Interesting to note that I cannot enjoy tBoI or Windosill on my current PC setup without gameplay becoming bogged down almost instantly; but with Botanicula, never any bogging or catching.) Summed up: the graphics, gameplay, sound and music - all superb, A+++. What more can I say to get you to try out this lovely gem?...\n\nThere was a tremendous amount of heart put into this game, truly.\n\nBotanicula is a visual and (emphasis on) auditory indulgence: you may think you're just going to ease into it, test the waters with your big toe; but you will be swept away and never realise it till the ride comes to its satisfyingly, cyclical conclusion. It offers a kind of cleansing and respite, whether from the mundane of the outside world, or to just step away from frenetic and adrenaline-packed L4D2 runs. \n\nThe sounds are sheer ear candy \u2013 you want to touch everything. The world is strange and wondrous: during first-time gameplay, you never know what manner of creature or environment alteration will manifest itself from your curiosity-driven touching; subsequent gameplays (for myself, anyway) do not fail to continually instill such positive feelings because the graphics, music, creatures and environment (plus their corresponding sounds) are just that sublime. \n\nWhile there are, sadly, no cards to obtain from playing this game toward earning badges, the 47 in-game, animated cards more than make up for it; and count toward the game's 53 achievements. It is rewarding to collect them all (and yes, you will aspire to collect each and every one of them in every gameplay you attempt, even the time-spent Svolavac. (Though, I think there should be a card for the 3 jingle-y leaves that tumble out around your feet - other gamers like myself may know what I'm alluding to.) The names of the creatures achievements are in Czech, and punching them up into Google translate will not only add to your enjoyment, but enlighten it, as well. \n\nThe music steals you off from the word go, setting a pace perfectly harmonised to what is happening in the game, at that time. A previous reviewer here made mention of the burst of cheery song that erupts when you achieve a goal \u2013 it really does fill you with sheer happiness, no kidding... and lately, when playing L4D2, I've been thinking how cool (if a bit bizarre) it would be, hearing that tune after everyone's made it alive to the saferoom...\n\nDefinitely give it a try, if only to experience the eye and ear candy... if it doesn't turn out to be your kind of game - or you can only enjoy one gameplay - you will know someone who'll love it...\n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1412498810, "timestamp_updated": 1479938748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730262875556945801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12320642": {"recommendationid": "12320642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156876721", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1616891668}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful graphics, wonderful music, satisfying sound effects.

The puzzles are generally enjoyable, until you're only missing the last piece of the puzzle.

It never looks as if the environment is static, and the design of even the smallest creature is very well thought out and executed.\n\nThe music is rather bizarre, but it is by no means bad. It changes as you complete puzzles, and as creatures make sound. This helps to enhance the feel of the environment set up by the graphics.
