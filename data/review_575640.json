Each game in the series offers an assortment of colorful letters that can be used creatively to enhance your Steam profile, provided you're willing to put in the effort.\n\nBut here's the catch \u2013 some might not appreciate the fact that these achievements, when left uncompleted, can significantly lower your overall achievement completion average. To maintain your average, you'll need to meticulously play through every single level of every game, which can amount to hundreds or even thousands of achievements left untouched across the series.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the Zup series starts off relatively easy, but there's a twist. Some levels are better suited for touch screens to nail the timing precisely. And let's not forget about the hidden achievements that require you to tap random parts of the screen on random levels. If you're aiming for that coveted 100%, be prepared to have YouTube at the ready and be ready to spend hours on end working your way through these games.\n\nIn summary, the Zup series is a unique achievement treasure for Steam design enthusiasts, but it comes with the caveat of potentially affecting your overall achievement completion average. The gameplay starts easy but can get tricky, especially when touch screens are involved. Hidden achievements add to the challenge, making full completion a test of patience and determination. If you're up for the task, dive in and design your Steam profile with a colorful array of achievements!\n\nDisclaimer: I DO utilize AI to assist in crafting my reviews. Here's how it works:\n1.

Zup! 3 offers similar gameplay to its' predecessors, offering tons of different achievement icons to unlock to pimp out your Steam Profile.\n\nIf you have never played the first two games, here's what you can expect from Zup! 3 and the previous Zup! games.\nYour goal is very simple, get the blue ball to land on the green platform without any other blocks or obstacles underneath it. You can move the blue ball by clicking on a red cube, which will cause an explosion and move the blue ball accordingly. Complete all the levels to beat the game and gg. Expect anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour of game-play from this game. Almost all of the achievements are unlocked via simply playing through the game, however there are a few that require you to click on random things in the multiple menu's, on certain levels and things of that nature. Nevertheless, all achievements are very easy to unlock.\n\n6.5/10- There weren't too many changes from the first two games, to this one. While having tons more achievements, the game doesn't offer more levels or game-play than the others. Therefore, I don't find a need to change anything about the games original rating.

The primary reason these are so popular isn't really the gameplay, it's the mess of profile-decorating achievements that come with them, and/or the wallpapers that might drop when you craft their badges. Since [i]Zup 3[/i] is extremely similar to the first and second, this summary will repeat many of the highlights:\n\n[h3]Pros[/h3]\n\u2705 Tiny download, runs on a potato PC just fine\n\u2705 Clean presentation, simple one-click control\n\u2705 77 levels with 11 optional free DLC\n\u2705 Reliable physics, repeatable each time\n\u2705 The previously DLC-only silver block now makes its way into the main game, adding variety\n\u2705 More clever level design, actual challenge\n\u2705 A few \"hidden\" achievements for clicking special shapes and background symbols\n\n[h3]Cons[/h3]\n\u274c No new mechanics\n\u274c While it has more stages, it's still too short, and should have been combined with the prior games rather than being a standalone entry\n\u274c Very little replay value\n\u274c Achievement spam. You'll have to sift through 1700 if you choose to put them on your profile, which is a real chore.\n\u274c The music is extremely quiet for some reason, with no volume control?\n\nIn all likelihood, you are already a target customer for these games if you're reading this: For achievement collectors or profile decorators. Buy it for more of the same, but if you do, try to get it in the series bundle on sale. For everyone else, it's an okay casual puzzle game, but not the best Steam has to offer.\n\n[u]Achievement Hunters[/u]: Complete every stage.

Currently there are 15 zup games, any future ones will most likely hold this same criticism, however, I can only speak for the current ones.\n\nZup exists for one thing and one thing only. To pad your achievements on steam. Every level you play gives you a bunch of achievements, even just opening the game for the first time will drown you in achievements. One of the most common reasons for wanting said achievements is for your achievement showcase on your steam profile as each achievement in the game is a letter of the alphabet or a number this game will allow you to spell stuff out in there. If this is all you're looking for out of the game then I suppose it's for you.\n\nGameplay wise zup sucks. It's a physics based puzzle game with inconsistent physics and easy to solve puzzles (when the physics work). Each zup game is a clone of the others and really should just be sold as one large game since they are identical in everything except the achievements you get and the layout of levels. If they were all combined into one and even had a level editor so users could then create their own levels on the workshop then this game would be worth picking up and even worth more than the $0.99 asking price. But as it is I highly recommended against the game for anything gameplay related.

Often there are a bunch of explosive blocks to destroy at once by clicking on one of them, and only one triggers the effect that will make the ball land on the green surface; there is no way to deduce which is the right one, you just empirically try one block after the other.\n\nZup! is a physics sandbox for the the developer to design levels.

Just because a game has great (and/or realistic) graphics, doesn't mean it's a great game to play in terms of gameplay and replayablity. But the game looks like a flash game. Not to say that's a bad thing, it's just...meh... The background looks pretty plain as well with some random white shapes and a green door to advance the next stage once you've completed a puzzle. Overall, visuals not bad but some may not find it appealing to look at.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game has a very simple objective. You click the red blocks to make force for the yellow blocks which makes the white ball move to the area that will clear the stage. Very simple. But as you advance to the higher stages, you'll need to be quicker mentally to get the timing right. It's easy to understand but can get challenging to master.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nThere's none. I'm not joking. As far as I'm aware, there's no offficial soundtrack in the game. For those who play music for the soundtrack, there is none, so you're better off listen to your own music.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's a game that I reccommend for those who are into puzzles and those who are good into speed puzzles. Plus, it comes with nice achievements and Steam trading cards to spice up your profile, if you want to become a fancy and stylish player on Steam. Otherwise if you're not into puzzles, this isn't a reccommendation.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+Addictive gameplay that requires you to use your brain to think and do quick reactions.\n+Easy to understand objective.\n+Nice achievements and Steam trading cards for your profile.\n+Nice colours to look at.\n+Becomes challenging later on.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n-Somewhat bland visuals.\n-No music whatsoever besides sound effects.\n-Not for those that aren't into puzzle games.\n-No story.\n-All of the above (especially the second dotpoint) can get you to be bored.\n\n[h1]Rating[/h1]\n7/10\n\nSigned by \n\ud835\udcd0\ud835\udcc8\ud835\udcbd \ud835\udce5\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcc7\ud835\udcc2\ud835\udcbf\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcbe\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udcc3\nof the[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/HiddenAnimeGroup] \u1d00\u0274\u03b9\u1d0d\u1d07 Steam Community Group[/url]\n\n[quote]Follow the [url= https://store.steampowered.com/curator/25441181-%E1%B4%80%C9%B4%CE%B9%E1%B4%8D%E1%B4%87/] \u1d00\u0274\u03b9\u1d0d\u1d07 Curator Page [/url] for more Steam game reviews like this one![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1507365815, "timestamp_updated": 1529129414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551924228668212891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35524695": {"recommendationid": "35524695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162333187", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 2079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2031, "last_played": 1492518514}, "language": "english", "review": "rigged like 9/11", "timestamp_created": 1507314096, "timestamp_updated": 1507314096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35508291": {"recommendationid": "35508291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300298245", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 411, "playtime_forever": 3516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 970, "last_played": 1590103017}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game to pass the time.", "timestamp_created": 1507258468, "timestamp_updated": 1507258468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523260712623596191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35430940": {"recommendationid": "35430940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020889645", "num_games_owned": 6920, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1506980157}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una excelente tercera entrega de Zup, la cual sigue conservando esa misma esencia adictiva que tienen los titulos anteriores.\n\nNo cambi\u00f3 mucho, creo que solo not\u00e9 dos cosas nuevas, primeramente los bloques blancos, los cuales se pueden eliminar clickeandoles encima y que en algunos niveles son de mucha importancia ya que retienen bloques amarillos \u00f3 impiden el paso al circulo az\u00fal y lo otro (y no estoy seguro) fue lo de los niveles con doble circulo az\u00fal, de all\u00ed en m\u00e1s creo que no hay elementos nuevos.\nSi algo caracteriza a estos juegos son sus niveles, ya que siempre son muy creativos y en este caso no es la excepci\u00f3n, se sigue notando el esfuerzo que ponen para crear niveles totalmente diferentes uno de otro.\n\nSin m\u00e1s que decir, me ha gustado mucho este Zup tambi\u00e9n, si bien el estilo de juego es el mismo que los anteriores, sigue siendo muy bueno.

Ah e depois com os achievements d\u00e1 para colocar as letras em destaque no teu perfil, fazendo o teu nome o que tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 um perkzito fixe! :P\n\nEnglish:\n\nI think when I\u00b4m talking about Zup! 3 I\u00b4m talking about the whole Zup! series. Basically it\u00b4s a little puzzle game, the point is to bring the blue ball to the green platform and keep it there at least 3 seconds. It\u00b4s as simple as it is and this counts also to the other Zups, they are all equal in their gameplay, the only thing that changes are the number of levels, achievements and the number on the title of course! xD This is one of those games where it\u00b4s sole purpose is to spend some free time, it\u00b4s a really easy game and quite quick to complete it. The price is very acceptable for a game like this, it\u00b4s like one of those Flash games you find on the internet! Oh, after getting the achievements, you can use the letters to put in your profile, spelling your name which is a cool little perk! :P", "timestamp_created": 1500058886, "timestamp_updated":

Therefore, I will be literally copy/pasting this across all of my reviews.\nMany people call these games out, citing that they're card farming games. While this may or may not be true, these games have some very good puzzles. Sure, they're short, but I feel that the price I paid for them is well worth it (Less than a dollar for each game in the summer sale?!). Some of the puzzles are really well thought out and it feels good to complete a game like this. So here's the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Good music, never found myself reaching for the mute button. The music IS on a loop, but it's comparable to Hexcells' music, so if you enjoyed that game's music, you'll enjoy their music as well.\n-Well designed puzzles, especially in 4 and Zero.\n\nCould be a pro or a con:\n-A ton of achievements.

Everytime you complete a puzzle, it rewards you a few achievements. The achievements have letters and symbols on them for people to spell out their names or whatever they want in their steam achievement showcase.\n\nIf you have any issues with getting past a level, you can just use the community guides and you should be able to get all the achievements within a few minutes (I got the cards, which is why I have many hours in all zup games). \n\n[h1][b]Overall...[/b][/h1] \nPersonally, I like Zup!

And there is a good reason for this \u2013 there is not much to talk about. I cannot say that the game is bad, no, but the good parts of it are not worth a positive review. I wish there was a neutral mark, but, unfortunately, Steam sees everything in blue and red only. \n\nHowever, I should also mention that this type of games is just not my genre. I like neither clickers nor short plotless games like this. What is the main idea of Zup? Bring the ball to the green platform. Repeat 50 times. Get 1000+ achievements. I hoped for some kind of challenge, but there is none.\n\nSorry, this is not what I like in games. I gave it a try but that is it. I do not think I will play any other games of this series. They are too simple, too repetitive, in my humble opinion. It does not mean they are bad! It is just not my cup of soup. For this reason, I just cannot give it a positive review even though there were no bugs or obviously unpleasant moments like violence or nudity. \n\nI hope fans of this game will understand my point of view and will not be offended.", "timestamp_created": 1493579883, "timestamp_updated": 1493581015, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550830543041229248", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31469881": {"recommendationid": "31469881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167136046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1494336690}, "language": "spanish", "review": "recomendado demaciado bueno este juego es entretenido 100% recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1493576940, "timestamp_updated": 1493576940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31463662": {"recommendationid": "31463662", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962090181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 842, "playtime_forever": 1934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1397, "last_played": 1502011867}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1493558665, "timestamp_updated": 1493558665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5396079421043396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31463469": {"recommendationid": "31463469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137048701", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1497707223}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello!\nMaybe you thing this game it's simple and you are right !\nIt's simple and fun\nHave a lot of  achievement's and nice levels.\nI don't now what to say more about this game.\nIf you want to find more try it !", "timestamp_created": 1493558080, "timestamp_updated": 1497551898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31457008": {"recommendationid": "31457008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116640681", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1498569590}, "language": "english", "review": "Fastest achievement geathering game ever and it's fun to play too :) \nPros:\n1.

I seriously can not stop myself.\n\n[b] Review [/b]\nI think when the person was making the achievements that they accidentally made 5 achievements when it was zuppose to be one. I like looking at the different color cubes... I get distracted way too easily. I spent about a whole hour just looking at the color cubes and trying to make them spin as fast as possible by using the explosions. Anywho, want tons of achievements and an easy perfect game for cheap than this is for you.\n\n[b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nThis review is just my opinion.

I think the justification for this is that they can be used for display on players' profile pages.\n\nSo, for example, when you complete the A stage you'll be awarded several \"A\" achievements of various colours so you have a choice when it comes to showcasing naughty words on your page. But I personally think that's all beside the point; it's there to enjoy or ignore as you please. But I think the real issue with Zup! 3 is that Zup! 2 exists... You just can't recapture that same magic by merely repeating the same trick twice.\n\nWhile the second in the series felt like an evolution of the idea and brought some fun challenge along with it, this really feels like more of the same without adding much new (not massively surprising given the quick turnaround of all three games). In fact, many stages feel like rethreads of levels from the last game. At one point near the end it threatens to get exciting when it introduces two balls to deal with instead of one. But this is quickly abandoned after a few levels before reverting to type.\n\nAgain, as with the previous entries, this is a solid, enjoyable game, and it even lasts longer than the others, too, clocking in at maybe thirty to forty minutes this time. But I can't help but feel a little disappointed that it's merely an extension of the old without ringing in the new. In the event a fourth game is ever released, I hope they just go wild and throw everything at us.

And I'd be lying if I said this game is perfect, but I have to give praise where praise is due. This game really surprised me!\n\nThe very first distinction I'd like to make between this and Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017 is that unlike that dissappointment, I would actually consider this a game and a rather enjoyable and intuitive one at that! It is clear that Zup! goes for the same demographic; achievement hunters, completionists, whatever you want to call them. I consider myself part of that group, so I felt inclined to give this game a try despite my rather low expectations. Very much like the building blocks that you interact with in Zup! my expectations were blown away! This is definitely a puzzle game first and foremost, and an achievement treasure second.\n\nYour objective is to bring the blue square onto the green tiles through the use of explosions. The red squares are explosive and clicking them will make them blow up, knocking any yellow and blue squares away in the process. It really is as simple as that. But just because the mechanics are simple it doesn't necessarely mean that the game itself is easy, in fact I'd say far from it.\n\nThe levels start out easy enough, and for the first few levels it feels like this might have actually been a bad choice after all, just another cash grab copy paste job with loads of achievements attached, but then you reach level 10 and things start to get interesting. As you progress through the game each level becomes more and more challenging and you need to both think of the right solution and make use of your reflexes and predictions to launch the blue square with the right trajectory and force to get it where it needs to be.\n\nSoon I had forgotten about my prior pessimism and was instead joyfully exploring in how many ways I could try to knock the yellow block-towers down and with what sort of speed I could send the blue square flying in order to solve the puzzle in front of me. The simple yet addictive nature of the game had caught me entirely off guard and I was getting more and more intrigued and hopeful for the next challenge the game would provide me with...\n\nAnd then it ended. Just like that.\n\nIf anything, that would be my only real gripe with the title, it is extremely short. I beat the whole thing with 100% achivements in only a couple of minutes, and I wish it would go on for a bit longer as I was actually having quite a bit of fun with it. But to be fair the game has a very low price point and the tags do describe it as \"short\" so I should have been expecting it to end rather quickly.\n\nAll that said, I hope you understand my thoughts about this game but in case I was too lengthy in my description of it and the enjoyment it gave me let me try to sum it up in a few short words:\n\nThis is a short but fun and intuitive physics puzzle game. I had a lot of fun with it and the achievements are a bonus rather than the main focus. I recommend this highly if you want some quick fun, and I suggest you pick up the Zup-Zup! Bundle which hosts all three games for a very affordable price. I have not yet played the other two titles, but if they are anywhere as good as this then I cannot recommend it enough.\"\n\nAfter playing the two sequels I can happily say that they are worthy successors. If you liked the first two games, you are going to like this. If you did not, you won't find anything different here. It's the same concept with more levels, more achievements and more Zup!\n\nOne thing this one tries to innovate with is the introduction of white blocks that you can remove by clicking on them. These give further depth and variation to the levels, but unfortunately come with the downside of making things feel a bit more trial and error. Some levels can feature ten+ white blocks in a row, and the smallest variation in which blocks are removed can completely change the outcome of the level. I felt the will to innovate was welcome, but sadly I believe this to be the least enjoyable of the three games as the white blocks took away from the game's simplistic but challenging and fair nature, and put it closer to the concept of \"repeat until you succeed\".\n\nNone the less, this is still a very nice simplistic puzzle game for a very affordable price. I recommend you check out the first two, and if you like them, then come back and play this afterwards.", "timestamp_created": 1484718140, "timestamp_updated": 1484718140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29327169": {"recommendationid": "29327169", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963703112", "num_games_owned": 1808, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1484366823}, "language": "english", "review": "bought it, played it, completed it, all achievements gotten in about 1 hour 30 minutes...", "timestamp_created": 1484698762, "timestamp_updated": 1484698762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467289716005325317", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29327104": {"recommendationid": "29327104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045226876", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1484754136}, "language": "english", "review": "You want 1708 Steam achievements in less than an hour?

Atleast in the previous entry you got a damn Gabe Newells face to make your steam profile shine.\n\nIn summary, it's an ok game for under a buck.

We're through the looking glass here, folks.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed [i]Zup![/i] and [i]Zup! 2[/i] (a deceptively-simple pair of puzzle games that have you clicking on explosive red blocks in order to get a blue block over to a green platform and unlock the next stage), this third installment is already pushing the limits of what I'm willing to tolerate. I considered the DLC for the second game a neat little bonus, but it's as if the developers saw how much people were playing their little title and decided to go all post-modern and edgy on their player base.\n\nYou can't start this game for the first time without getting 20 achievements.

There are so many achievement messages coming on-screen at once that it actually messes with the flow of the game in certain situations, by making it so that you either have to wait or click through the achievements in order to activate the exit gate.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the game itself, whose sole innovation this time is that the item you have to get into the green \"safe\" area is now a ball instead of a square, and there are white tiles you have to click on in later levels in order to make them vanish and solve certain puzzles. Couldn't this have just been produced as an add-on for the previous title?\n\nI'm not sure who this game was intended for. The achievement symbols themselves are noticeably less polished and refined than the ones from the original game (which look very nice in an achievement showcase, similar to how [i]LYNE[/i] had its set of achievements). There's no real innovation or unique designs on display here other than a reliance in the later levels of using \"step\" tiles to roll the ball into certain areas. The achievements feel like a giant joke that was designed to undermine and trivialize Steam's achievement system.\n\nYou're better off sticking with the first two games and not wasting your time on this unless you're desperate for more achievements.

Each level gives at least 14 (seven from opening, and another seven for beating it), and there are a few hidden ones along the way. Some levels require somewhat precise timing to clear, but the game can still be completed in under an hour. There is also no reason to replay a level unless you want to figure out an alternative way of clearing.\n\nThe game can probably stand on its own merits, but is clearly targeted at achievement hunters. Concerns about devaluing achievements aside, this has started a trend of cheap games with a massive number of achievements to make a sale. I'm unsure what kind of problems this will lead to in the near future.\n\nUltimately, Zup! 3 is at least still a game, and should still be worth a look if you know what the game is about.", "timestamp_created": 1484272278, "timestamp_updated": 1484272278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674262881278991699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29214925": {"recommendationid": "29214925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312641368", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1486426136}, "language": "english", "review": "I had a space saved on my desktop for Zup! 3.

With such an insane boost to any collector\u2019s count, and at such a low cost, this game is pretty much an insta-buy. I can probably guarantee that 80% of the people checking the reviews right now are just wondering how easy and how long it will take to get them all. The answer is: super easy, and most likely under an hour (upwards to 2 hours depending on skill). \n\n[h1]Those Missing Achievements[/h1]\n\nIn fact, the achievements are so easy to get, there are probably only a handful of moments where there wasn\u2019t an achievement getting unlocked. With 77 levels to play through, the achievement requirements basically include: opening/beating all levels, clicking anywhere, restarting levels, and finding specific symbols/shapes \u201chidden\u201d (in plain sight) throughout the levels. The Discussions are starting to get flooded with questions of missing achievements. \n\nHint: some of the symbols are obvious, some will require some \"needless\" exploding.\nHint 2: take another look around levels: F, L, S, 2, <, [.\n\n[h1]What About the Game?[/h1]\n\nRegarding the gameplay, I\u2019ve actually found it to be somewhat enjoyable, much more than other cheap cash grabs on Steam, but something expected for a single dollar title. This physics based puzzle game revolves around clicking explosion blocks to propel hardened blocks/ball(s) to a goal platform. The physics is oddly satisfying, since there is an order to the madness. Blocks will magically land in such a way (skewed, angled, stacked, blocked, etc.) to get the ball to the goal. Most of the levels do require a little bit of timing, so it isn't just a monotonous slog, but there isn\u2019t anything real challenging here. There are definitely a few cheeky levels thrown in there for the dev to have some fun too. \n\n[h1]Complete Walkthrough[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWAd5_sO-5I\n\n[table][tr][td][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BeforeYouBuy]Before You Buy[/url] \u2013 analyses of newly released indie games[/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1484253250, "timestamp_updated": 1485200188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560150504112243652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29210804": {"recommendationid": "29210804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198224559516", "num_games_owned": 1518, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1484261543}, "language": "english", "review": "These achievements could be far more beautiful!", "timestamp_created": 1484253169, "timestamp_updated": 1484259915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29210705": {"recommendationid": "29210705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202404811", "num_games_owned": 704, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1489677060}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice & Simple Game!\nSo many Achievments though xD\n", "timestamp_created": 1484252814, "timestamp_updated": 1484252814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616971254348754883", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29210366": {"recommendationid": "29210366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028673669", "num_games_owned": 7051, "num_reviews": 401, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1484279821}, "language": "english", "review": "It happened again, way earlier than I expected. \n\n1700 achievements for your profile decoration for 1$\n15 minutes of puzzles gameplay where you don't have to think for 1$\nSteam cards for 1$\n+1 perfect achievements game for 1$\nEarly bird discount!\n\nNow you just wait for \"!\"\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840822901", "timestamp_created": 1484251754, "timestamp_updated": 1489189484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631074965000152588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29210221": {"recommendationid": "29210221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129427227", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62, "last_played": 1484293423}, "language": "english", "review": "You are basically paying for the achievements.But ill take it.Not much of a puzzle tho", "timestamp_created": 1484251311, "timestamp_updated": 1484251311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439465045928955078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29210148": {"recommendationid": "29210148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085935850", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68, "last_played": 1499981024}, "language": "english", "review": "1708 achievements made everyone go crazy for this game lol.
