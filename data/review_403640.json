There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[*] On the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. \n\n[*] Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens\u2019 moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others. Just a little hint ;)\n\n[*] Some of the level designs are really cool and creative, I have three favorite missions and places. I like that there are many ways to deal with enemies \u2013 use powers, mines, grenades, sleep darts etc. Another good thing is the freedom in how you play: Be unseen in one mission or let guards ring how many alarms they want. Make people sleep and turn a place into a snoring town. Or go haywire on everyone. Your choice.\n\n[*] It was fun to escape to rooftops or use blink/far reach to get away from enemies and hide somewhere. To tease and confuse an enemy was also fun, by blinking right in front of one and then blink behind their back. Or distract enemies with a copy of yourself. Both Emily and Corvo have great powers. Upgraded Windblast made me feel like Darth Vader blasting enemies into walls. If only Fus Ro Dah would have been this powerful.\n\n[*] Final thoughts, Dishonored 2 is an incredible game that is an absolute 'must-buy' if you enjoyed the original title. It's highly improved, looks amazing, and very in-depth when it comes to skills, ways to kill people, sneak around, hidden/secret places, and... So much more. Unbelievable. I bought it for three euros and boy oh boy. I love every second of it.\n[/list]\n[/quote]\n[quote]\n[h1]Contact:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Steam: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/wholfofficial/]Click here[/url]\n[*] Twitch: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/wholfofficial]Click here[/url] \n[*] Youtube: [url=https://www.youtube.com/c/wholfofficial]Click here[/url]\n[*] Steam follow: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/wholfofficial/myworkshopfiles/]Click here[/url]\n[*] Discord: [url=https://discord.gg/sTmrp7Fj3J]Click here[/url]\n[/list]\n[b]Contact/Business:[/b] Contact \"wholf\" on Discord or by adding me on Steam.

That being said, it does as great a job as it can to keep you engaged but somehow, throughout my play through, I just had a much harder time being completely invested in it. I did want to see how the game ended, but when It did, I couldn't help but feel a little rushed/underwhelmed. \n\nWhat REALLY kept bringing me back is the gameplay mechanics. It is SO FUN darting around the city trying to not raise alarms, find secret passageways and planning for a nonlethal approach all for it to come crashing down by one misplaced dash. I felt fine still though when my stealth approach failed, because the combat alone is incredibly engaging and fun. It doesn't feel drawn out, it doesnt feel like you're slogging through enemies, every gameplay mechanic feels very well balanced. \n\nTL;DR I do still 100% recommend this game. Although the story feels fabricated just for a second game, It is still engaging enough to want to see it through and the combat is absolutely addicting.

This sequel not only lives up to the high expectations set by its predecessor but surpasses them in ways that showcase a true evolution in game design. Building upon the foundation of the first game, [i] Dishonored 2 [/i] introduces a host of improvements that elevate the overall experience to new heights.\n\nOne of the most notable enhancements is the depth of choice in playstyle. Whether you prefer a stealthy approach or a more aggressive combat style, the game accommodates your decisions with a level of fluidity that is both seamless and gratifying. The expanded array of supernatural abilities adds a layer of creativity to gameplay, allowing for inventive and strategic approaches to each mission.\n\nThe narrative is also just as captivating as its predecessor, with a compelling story that unfolds dynamically based on player choices. The dual protagonists, Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano, each bring their own unique skills and perspectives to the table, providing a fresh and engaging experience for both newcomers and fans of the series.\n\nHowever, what truly sets this instalment apart is its vibrant and meticulously crafted environments. From the sun-drenched streets of Karnaca to the eerie grandeur of the Clockwork Mansion, each location feels like a living, breathing entity. The level of detail in the world design is nothing short of remarkable, creating a visually stunning backdrop for the player's adventures.\n\nIn all, [i] Dishonored 2 [/i] is an example of how a sequel should evolve and improve upon its predecessor. The enhanced gameplay mechanics, rich narrative, and, most notably, the stunning and vibrant environments make it a must-play for fans of immersive and atmospheric gaming experiences.

All in all, a fantastic stealth experience. Going for 100 percent in this game means multiple playthroughs but the game play and story are enough for you to at least play it twice and if you really want the 100 percent a 3rd time with no powers. \nThe only thing a bit frustrating about this game is that some achievements require you to do specific things through the whole play through and if you miss those things you are going to be playing the game all over again to try and get them. I've actually beat the game more times than I care to count because of specific achievements. I'm not saying this type of achievement is bad it just becomes extremely tedious after awhile. \nOverall though, for a 2nd game, it's quite good.

La historia est\u00e1 bastante chula ,gr\u00e1ficamente en su salsa, como en el 1 pero un poco m\u00e1s mejorado, con el t\u00edpico estilo que tiene Arkane y Bethesda. Tienes la opci\u00f3n de no jugar con poderes, que ahora mismo creo recordar que en el 1 tambi\u00e9n pero no lo coment\u00e9 en la review del 1.

Obra maestra. Puede estar f\u00e1cilmente en mi top 5 de videojuegos.\n\nTrama: Seamos sinceros los guionistas de Dishonored no se comen la cabeza con la premisa. Dishonored 1 dan un golpe contra la emperatriz y te vengas\u2026Dishonored 2 igual pero ahora eliges si ser la emperatriz o sigues siendo el Chad Corvo para acabar con los golpistas. Dicho eso creo que, aunque los objetivos de asesinatos son menos emblem\u00e1ticos, las misiones y escenarios est\u00e1n mejor dise\u00f1ados y son mas interesantes. Los mapas son m\u00e1s grandes y hay m\u00e1s maneras de infiltrarse en las ubicaciones.  Bendito al programador que creo el personaje de Delilah y su historia de origen (en referente a eso, creo que el juego se disfruta mas si lo juegas como Emily porque creo que su relaci\u00f3n con Delilah es mas personal y desarrollas mas un vinculo de no saber si dice la verdad y sois familia o si miente).\n\nJugabilidad: Han cogido todas las cosas que funcionaban del 1 y las han mejorado adem\u00e1s de meter nuevas mec\u00e1nicas que a mi gusto son mucho m\u00e1s inmersivas como:\n1)Los mercados negros, no solo el hecho de poder comprar y gastar el dinero que recoges de manera mas directa, si no todo ese lore que da a karnaca que te incita a explorar y a buscar las tiendas (y a robarlas).\n2)Los soldados mec\u00e1nicos son extra\u00f1os, duros y representan una seria amenaza.\n3)La misi\u00f3n de viajar en el tiempo y sus efectos\u2026ojal\u00e1 haber visto m\u00e1s de esa mec\u00e1nica. Una maravilla de misi\u00f3n.\n4)La mansi\u00f3n de jindosh es una obra maestra y un placer visual de principio a fin. \n5)Las moscas de la sangre como sustituto de las ratas de la plaga.\n6)El modo sin poderes incrementa la dificultad del juego enormemente.\n7)El sistema de caos regresa cosa que no puede faltar en un Dishonored.\n8)Muchas m\u00e1s cosas hasta el punto de que podr\u00eda estar hablando horas de esta saga.\nEn general Dishonored 2 pule las mec\u00e1nicas del 1 y agrega m\u00e1s opciones, haciendo que el mundo sea m\u00e1s animado y sus niveles mucho m\u00e1s grandes e inmersivos. Los poderes de Emily me parecen una versi\u00f3n muy interesante de la marca del forastero y creo que se diferencian muy bien de los de Corvo.\n\nDise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico y sonido: M\u00fasica y dise\u00f1o de niveles igual o por encima del 1. Mapas mas grandes y mas variados con mayor cantidad de edificios y me gusta mucho el gui\u00f1o de la misi\u00f3n final como replicando la misi\u00f3n final del 1. La banda sonora es genial, jugar este juego con auriculares lo hace mucho mejor sin duda.\n\nOpini\u00f3n personal: Creo que, aunque el Dishonored 1 tiene misiones m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticas pero el 2 es mejor juego en pr\u00e1cticamente todos los aspectos debido a que b\u00e1sicamente pule todas las mec\u00e1nicas y mejor\u00e1ndolas, dando mayor capacidad de elecci\u00f3n al jugador. He echado de menos algo tan ic\u00f3nico como es el Distrito Inundado y Daud y sus balleneros, pero creo que las brujas (sacadas pero mejoradas de los dlcs del 1) suponen un reto igual o incluso mayor.\nQUEJA: NO ME GUSTA QUE HAYAN SACADO EL DLC DEATH OUTSIDER COMO UN JUEGO POR SEPARADO. Es un buen dlc y tal pero no me gusta que lo hayan sacado en steam como un juego porque por muy mecanicas nuevas que metas se nota que es un dlc. Dicho eso, deberiais comprar tanto el juego como su dlc.

is worse than the first one, some of the reasons are just absurd like Corvo/Emily being voiced player character, equating to all of the refinements and gameplay changes that people complained about in the first game having been resolved in Dishonored 2 as somehow being a negative. \nnot only were just about ALL of your issue's from the first game rectified, combat mechanics have been expanded meaning non-lethal combat amounts to way more than using sleep darts, blinking behind someone or breaking line of sight and then blinking behind a guard to choke them out.\n\nthe story has some kinda dull moments but to be perfectly honest and despite what the cult of rose tinted glasses likes to say online, so did the first game and imo this is a much more enjoyable story to work your way through. \ngive it a try, especially when it is on sale, just stay away from death of the outsider, there are no redeeming qualities to that release which was originally supposed to be a DLC for Dishonored 2 and unlike DOTO the gameplay and movement in Dishonored 2 is sharp, responsive and carries just enough weight to really make you think about how you're going to both interact with & move through the game world.\n\nlastly: it really is a shame that Arkane has been effectively killed off by Microsoft and because of that we will never see any other games like this nor any additions to the Dishonored story, everything from in game lore, to how some of the achievement descriptions were written out, points to the original dev's from D1 and 2 (which along with 70% of the staff are no longer a part of Arkane Studios) had planned on further expanding this series' story.\nwhat a wild, interesting ride Corvo & Emily's story has been, glad to have experienced it and I hope whoever

dishonored 2 i would first start with what i had to say about dishonored 1:\n\n\"dishonored is one of my favourite games ever made, its like half life and mgs made love together in a very uniquely styled whale-blubber-punk universe, i can never get enough of it and could replay these games til i die, together with MGS i never spent so many hours in a single player game that is not a straight up open world rpg with a shitilion of nonlinear quests, the core gameplay is a beautiful stealth oriented sandbox with a blade and spells, a sort of half open / semi linear world with incredibly captivating level design, dishonored is is FUN and will be FUN a thousand times over, i ll never grow tired of it, i love the story, characters, the world, the level design, everything\"\n\nthen id simply continue by saying that dishonored 2 only adds onto that in terms of gameplay and ive spent even more hours in it and literally the only thing i dislike about dishonored 2 is the main antagonist, for all i care she could be written out of the script and id prefer it, but thats a tiny scratch on something that i absoultley ADORE otherwise\n\nid recommend both dishonored 1 and 2 to

I will try to just describe the aspects of the game that make this a NO n my opinion.\n\nThe biggest aspect is the scripted enemy behavior which is so transparently scripted (and super buggy) that it very much spoils the gameplay.\n\nEnemies do not continually adapt to their surroundings, something triggers a behavioral script in them and then they start executing that script despite the conditions of the game changing, or even if that action is inappropriate.\n\nSometimes an enemy will hear a noise at your location and track you down but then get stuck on the stairs or a tree branch and just walk \"in the air\" permanently. You may be long gone but they are still striding aggressively into open space while their toe is caught on something or they've found their way inside an object they shouldn't be inside.\n\nEnemy sight lines logic is completely broken. You get seen through solid objects for no apparent reason. A great example is enemies at ground level will spot you from hundreds of meters away through gaps in level geometry, even though you're in a closed room on the fourth floor of a building. All of a sudden 6 guards from various directions will all go into swarm mode and run directly up four flights of stairs and through a maze of corridors, opening perfect doors to come and destroy you.\n\nYou might take out a pistol in a back alley and blow a guard's head off. A neutral NPC standing within arm's reach will remark \"did you hear a gunshot?\". Another NPC will walk into the aftermath of a razorwire trap which has completely dismembered a guard, kneel down in the body parts and blood and say \"oh no somebody feels unwell!\". Or you're walking through a crowded shop area with 5 NPC chilling and one will decide to grab their head and run screaming from you.\n\nAnd this is what makes the game unplayable. You can be sneaking around, and the broken scripting causes the most insane things to happen at the most unpredictable times.\n\nYou might throw a glass to distract an enemy or draw him to an area, but then he gets a pot stuck on his foot and goes mental, running and clanking around. This type of stuff happens constantly, too many to mention! If it was once or twice you could laugh at it and reload, but when every 2nd or 3rd enemy/NPC does something insane, it makes it so you just have to save scum your way through the game if you want to play stealthy.\n\nAnd the above speaks to the worst part. The utter broken-ness of the game kind of forces you into a violent playstyle if you just want to proceed without frustration. It's actually easy, way too easy to pistol blast, and slash enemies to pieces with your sword. They put an insane amount of effort into making gory decapitation and evisceration animations for some reason. You can pick up decapitated heads and torsos - why? Ugh. I don't mind a bit of cartoony violence in games but this seemed twisted in it's lurid detail.\n\nOther than that this game has all the ingredients you'd be looking for, but it is so broken technically that it's just frustrating.\n\nI really don't like this game and I'm just \"hate finishing\" it at this point but I refuse to kill any more I don't care how many times I have to reload the same areas.", "timestamp_created": 1700014372, "timestamp_updated": 1700014372, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.394561171531677246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150144996": {"recommendationid": "150144996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001985516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 127, "playtime_at_review": 89, "last_played": 1700059814}, "language": "english", "review": "\u28e4\u28f6\u28f6\u28e4\u2840\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2839\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2801\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28f0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28f0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28c0\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ba\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28ec\u28fb\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u2866\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2819\u283b\u283f\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u284f\u281b\u2801\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28fd\u28ff\u287f\u2801\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2880\u2860\u28ff\u28f7\u28e4\u2840\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2830\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u2807\u2800\u2820\u283f\u283f\u280f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800", "timestamp_created": 1700010392, "timestamp_updated": 1700010427, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.31447291374206543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150144939": {"recommendationid": "150144939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135920859", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1331, "last_played": 1600275772}, "language": "english", "review": "A good sequel to the original Dishonored.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son found this game at Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3", "timestamp_created": 1699989696, "timestamp_updated": 1699989696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469996064901351929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150130732": {"recommendationid": "150130732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989994200", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 363, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1700600455}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and a sucessful sequel in almost any way.

I remember when they had annouced the game, all the cinematics trailers and hype for the game had me excited.\n\nThe story of the game takes places almost 15 years after the events of the first game. It starts in the Castle celebrating the aniversay of Jessamine Kaldwin; where the Duke of Serkonos reveals that Jessamine had an elder sister - Delilah Kaldwin - the rightful Empress. Depending on who you choose, you can either play as Corvo or Emily. An option which I admire that the Game Designer and Developers added was that to refuse the Outsider's Mark. If you accept the Mark, both the playable characters have their own set of unique Powers. If anyone had played the DLC from Dishonored, Delilah Kaldwin is foreshadowed there.\n\nThe theme of the game is very much different from the old Victorian era of the first game and is now more vibrant and beautiful on the Karnaca. \n\nThey really have polished and made the game much better. The best part why I really love Dishonored 2 is due to the 2 Missions - Clockwerk Mansion and Crack in the Slab.\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsQiKKfKxug] Video Link [/url] I would recommend anyone whose interested in how they made these Levels.", "timestamp_created": 1699669788, "timestamp_updated": 1699669788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149886135": {"recommendationid": "149886135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314237176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1587, "last_played": 1661032939}, "language": "english", "review": "The Clockwork Mansion will always be my favourite video game level of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1699643831, "timestamp_updated": 1699643831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149851855": {"recommendationid": "149851855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138218416", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1015, "playtime_at_review": 6820, "last_played": 1700080582}, "language": "english", "review": "Feel like a badass arcane assassin  Pt. 2  10/10", "timestamp_created": 1699596549, "timestamp_updated": 1700655780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149836298": {"recommendationid": "149836298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366657820", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 3169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3169, "last_played": 1674918481}, "language": "english", "review": "The dishonored world is among my favorites. great games.", "timestamp_created": 1699567688, "timestamp_updated": 1699567688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149834646": {"recommendationid": "149834646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393039932", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 319, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1699911723}, "language": "english", "review": "Hellooooo my great childhood!", "timestamp_created": 1699565198, "timestamp_updated": 1699565198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149800674": {"recommendationid": "149800674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093698914", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1471, "last_played": 1699507138}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1699515535, "timestamp_updated": 1699515535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149795859": {"recommendationid": "149795859", "author": {"steamid": "76561199440010580", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2220, "last_played": 1675480531}, "language": "english", "review": "Waiting for the fourth game", "timestamp_created": 1699507049, "timestamp_updated": 1699849623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60235518217086792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149786805": {"recommendationid": "149786805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051745489", "num_games_owned": 450, "num_reviews": 340, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1699393353}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the first game and this one blew me away.

I will try to just describe the aspects of the game that make this a NO n my opinion.\n\nThe biggest aspect is the scripted enemy behavior which is so transparently scripted (and super buggy) that it very much spoils the gameplay.\n\nEnemies do not continually adapt to their surroundings, something triggers a behavioral script in them and then they start executing that script despite the conditions of the game changing, or even if that action is inappropriate.\n\nSometimes an enemy will hear a noise at your location and track you down but then get stuck on the stairs or a tree branch and just walk \"in the air\" permanently. You may be long gone but they are still striding aggressively into open space while their toe is caught on something or they've found their way inside an object they shouldn't be inside.\n\nEnemy sight lines logic is completely broken. You get seen through solid objects for no apparent reason. A great example is enemies at ground level will spot you from hundreds of meters away through gaps in level geometry, even though you're in a closed room on the fourth floor of a building. All of a sudden 6 guards from various directions will all go into swarm mode and run directly up four flights of stairs and through a maze of corridors, opening perfect doors to come and destroy you.\n\nYou might take out a pistol in a back alley and blow a guard's head off. A neutral NPC standing within arm's reach will remark \"did you hear a gunshot?\". Another NPC will walk into the aftermath of a razorwire trap which has completely dismembered a guard, kneel down in the body parts and blood and say \"oh no somebody feels unwell!\". Or you're walking through a crowded shop area with 5 NPC chilling and one will decide to grab their head and run screaming from you.\n\nAnd this is what makes the game unplayable. You can be sneaking around, and the broken scripting causes the most insane things to happen at the most unpredictable times.\n\nYou might throw a glass to distract an enemy or draw him to an area, but then he gets a pot stuck on his foot and goes mental, running and clanking around. This type of stuff happens constantly, too many to mention! If it was once or twice you could laugh at it and reload, but when every 2nd or 3rd enemy/NPC does something insane, it makes it so you just have to save scum your way through the game if you want to play stealthy.\n\nAnd the above speaks to the worst part. The utter broken-ness of the game kind of forces you into a violent playstyle if you just want to proceed without frustration. It's actually easy, way too easy to pistol blast, and slash enemies to pieces with your sword. They put an insane amount of effort into making gory decapitation and evisceration animations for some reason. You can pick up decapitated heads and torsos - why? Ugh. I don't mind a bit of cartoony violence in games but this seemed twisted in it's lurid detail.\n\nOther than that this game has all the ingredients you'd be looking for, but it is so broken technically that it's just frustrating.\n\nI really don't like this game and I'm just \"hate finishing\" it at this point but I refuse to kill any more I don't care how many times I have to reload the same areas.", "timestamp_created": 1699465935, "timestamp_updated": 1699467702, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497668176889419556", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149766164": {"recommendationid": "149766164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033388400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1203, "last_played": 1698805278}, "language": "english", "review": "This one is better than the first to me.\n\nFirst off, no bugs at all.

But today I am the shark, and the prey is to become the rebellious duke - one of the conspirators who deprived the young empress Emily Kaldwin of the throne.\nI look towards the city from the island on which the duke's opulent residence is located.

Dishonored, but fixed some of the annoying flaws of the first game, things like not being able to do a non-lethal takedown in combat, not being able to refuse the Outsider's mark, and not being able to see during a mission whether you have been observed or have been at fault for a kill. \n\nEach of the two possible protagonists has access to a slightly different set of powers, and both sets feel appropriately powered.  There's an option that allows you to retain your runes and some other things from a previous playthrough, so you're not feeling the tedium of trying to get runes to the same powers again.   It also lets you use powers from both protagonists, so it feels sort of self-indulgent but in a very fun way.\n\n\nThe settings/locations are really cool and a couple of the missions have a fun twist.  This isn't a terribly long game, but so much thought has gone into the mechanics and lore and there are so many Easter eggs and details to find that it's really a joy to play.  \n\nIf I had to nitpick:\n\nEnemies' detection skills scale with difficulty settings, but I wish they were more sensitive/observant at high levels.  \n\nThe game retains its predecessor's high vs low-chaos system, but the game is clearly making more distinctions than that.  When I did a kill-everyone playthrough, there were slight differences in the world compared to a more moderate high-chaos run, but that wasn't reflected in the designation.

Game gives you a choice at the beginning which character to play which is a nice thing, since they have different skills (Emily\u2019s skills are the new ones) but it is not explained at the beginning for some reason. There are some interesting level designs to experience with labyrinth-like and shifting time but my main problem was the story. It is a bit similar to the first game and plain boring without any inspiration. You can see similar stories all around and this one has a lot of hollow characters. Unfortunately, endings were pretty anticlimactic and not thought thoroughly in any way. Obviously if you are playing a high chaos, game offers you much more, for the low chaos with no kill and no spot runs, it is pretty boring. Also, you see the problems with the gameplay there. I had problem with someone is dying for some reason at the end of the level with no save. Same thing happened with the spotted part, even though there was no reason for me to be spotted (Tutorial texts were open to be sure and it did not even trigger), I was spotted and that means I had to start the level from the zero. At least, they added the Stats which you can track your stats but you have to check all the time, since it can add a kill or being spotted stat. Other than that, some enemies die because of the sleep dart for no reason, bottles explode if someone falls near it or enemies get suspicious, if they hear footsteps from an inhabited area. Plus, most of the bonecharms are useless, especially for the silent run.

If you don't care about the story at all and just want more Dishonored gameplay, this game is good - more than that even, as it refines pretty much every mechanic from Dishonored 1 and has very well made levels to boot. That said though, mind your eyes, because this game has a much brighter palette and environments compared to the darkness of 1, which I personally find jarring at times.\n\nWhile I would say I like this game, it's really more like a \"I like it, but have some criticisms that prevent me from loving it.\" Particularly with the story. That point and a few others actually prevented me from enjoying this game on my first playthrough a couple of years back, and only recently did I return to it, played it multiple times, and got all the achievements.\n\nI went straight into this game after Dishonored 1, and naturally, I was pretty excited. That excitement pretty much evaporated though once I saw the introduction of the game. Without spoiling anything directly, Daud's entire story got undone in less than two minutes, so if you were a fan of his character and DLC from the first game, this game has bad news for you. \n\nIf you don't mind the introduction being spoiled: [spoiler]Delilah is back like nothing happened, and not only that, she claims to be the sister of Jessamine Kaldwin, therefore she is the rightful empress and Emily isn't. BOOM, you just got DISHONORED. [/spoiler]. And the worst part is, real spoilers for the game this time: [spoiler] It's actually true. Delilah is the half sister of Jessamine, but there just happened to be zero mention or foreshadowing of that in DH1. Okay game, I believe you. [/spoiler] And if you read all that and thought \"Wow that sounds stupid,\" then just wait until you play Death of the Outsider, where it becomes obvious story was definitely on the backburner for this game.\n\nSpeaking of the Outsider though, he's back, obviously. But this time he has a new voice, which makes him sound and feel completely different than how he did in DH1. It made me feel like I was talking to his edgier son, rather than the Outsider himself. The Outsider of DH1 made you feel like you were talking to an entity that had thousands of years of knowledge and neither good nor evil, but was nonetheless just observing you in particular because he was curious about what you would do after what happened to you. The Outsider of 2 is a poor man's version at best - like I said before, I feel like I\u2019m talking to his son who\u2019s doing a poor job at imitating his father. And since we\u2019re on the topic, if you want to know another dumb story fact about this game [spoiler] He has a backstory too! That's right, they gave a *god* a backstory on how he became a god...Which I'm pretty sure nobody cared about and was never presented as a mystery in the first game. The Outsider is the Outsider - you didn't need to explain him! Nobody asked! [/spoiler]\n\nPlot stuff aside though, I think it's worth noting that this game distinctly feels different than DH1, and for lack of a better descriptor has a different \u201cvibe\" overall. Not a bad thing on its own, but graphics and environment wise, I expected more of the darkness from DH1. That game had a couple of bright environments too, but the difference between 1's occasional brightness and 2's bright environments are the difference between being in a dimly lit room and the sun being directly in your eyes. And when nearly every environment is so bright, you feel much less stealthy. It's a minor thing, and one that probably won't bother you, but I definitely didn't expect it, and to me it felt too different coming straight out of DH1.\n\nAnother thing worth noting: A lot of these environments are *way* more crowded than DH1. People actually roam the streets now and are kinda just all over the place. It makes the levels you're in feel alive, but you'll have a much more difficult time seeing and identifying enemies. You could think it's safe to sprint since there's seemingly no enemies around in a crowd of people, but then it turns out you were wrong and there was one or more who just kinda blended in with the crowd. Typically speaking, enemies stick out much less than they did in DH1.\n\nThese things aside, I still think this game is worth playing - you have many more options (particularly in the non lethal department) than you did in DH1, movement feels better, level design is crafted in such a way that it takes into account that you may choose to play without powers, and for the most part the powers feel better too (although if you want my advice, play as Corvo first because Emily's Far Reach feels terrible compared to Blink - the former is more like being Spiderman if that interests you over just being able to teleport). Gameplay wise, this game is an improvement over 1 in every way.\n\nOverall, this game is fun. Really fun. But to be blunt, the story reeks of \"we need a sequel NOW!\" energy, and if you're someone who cares about the story even a little, it'll probably annoy you, especially if you just got finished playing 1 and the Brigmore Witches DLC. Other than that, expect better gameplay, but a different \"vibe\" compared to the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1698366981, "timestamp_updated": 1698366981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636297106742858887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148939595": {"recommendationid": "148939595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267668071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1698700377}, "language": "english", "review": "ya", "timestamp_created": 1698356222, "timestamp_updated": 1698356222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148930553": {"recommendationid": "148930553", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985471896", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 967, "last_played": 1698429990}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great sequel to an excellent game, with some of the most interesting original IP in a video game that you are dropped into.

I actually pre-ordered dishonored 2 back then, not sure what I got for that, it mentioned something about getting stuff but never saw anything. I ended up not gaming anymore for several years and now I've recently started a bit again.\n\nThis game was a bit of a disappointment. I don't like having to choose between two protagonists in a game like this. Adding voices was a bit of a turn off for me. I don't really like emily, I don't feel she should be a playable character in the first place, just follow up with more corvo. Overall, this game was a very dull experience mainly because of looting. Having to use night eye 24/7 to try to find the items, trying to gather everything, having to search everywhere for bonecharms and runes... I spent so many hours looting everything and then found out it didn't really matter at all.\n\nThere's little consequences of one's actions. What, the heart complains a bit trying to guilt trip you? Maybe some characters mention it in passing? It just felt like it wasn't enough unlike in dishonored where even the weather changed if I recall correctly. \n\nThis kind of feels a bit like hitman in some ways, because you can either just go right ahead and kill the target very fast or skulk around and try to find another way, usually far more vile than simple death despite being the \"merciful\" option, but there's far less ways to interact with the environment, less options and less to see and do. Because of annoying it is to loot stuff and go everywhere, it takes several times the time to do that compared to just focusing on the main objective and honestly you don't really lose much for it.\n\nThe story is decent, but nothing that special. Lots of little snippets of lore and information everywhere but most of them aren't interesting or fun to read.\n\nI guess my main issue is how weird this game felt to play. Either you spend lots of time on nothing or you realize the game is only several hours long with little to see or do other than reading papers. Don't even get me started on the incremental/gradual acceleration or whatever it's called, never played a game with such nauseating gamepad acceleration, it starts very slow and then speeds up more and more, most games does this to some extent to help gamepad users control their aim but this is so heavily overdone that it feels sickening because it disrupts movements completely, I never got used to it, was just barely able to tolerate it and started to try using minimal camera movements so I didn't have to experience that movement curve.\n\nNever felt immersed or truly enjoying it, just barely enough to keep on going, out of a stubbornness to complete what I started more than anything else. I tried a bit of a second run with stealth focus and never being detected and it wasn't much more fun so I quit in the middle after a few hours. Perhaps a full kill, full stealth with dispersion of bodies would be fun. Corvos powers are much more fun than emily's and I played as her the first time, so I guess that's part of why I disliked the game overall. But when you finally start to truly use the powers, you realize you're very restricted by the amount of \"mana\" potions you have so it becomes less fun.\n\nI'd recommend playing the first game and then playing this but focusing solely on the story, don't get too side-tracked by items or texts, they're just a cheap time sink. You don't really need them to play the game because the game itself is very, very easy even on hard. Play it once and if you're curious about the different endings, watch it on youtube or something.", "timestamp_created": 1697764937, "timestamp_updated": 1697801936, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471343576908111572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148514739": {"recommendationid": "148514739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327066922", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 961, "last_played": 1697761255}, "language": "spanish", "review": "MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1697761332, "timestamp_updated": 1697761332, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418250977993011475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148514139": {"recommendationid": "148514139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374741502", "num_games_owned": 1673, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2816, "last_played": 1696415543}, "language": "english", "review": "The bottom line is, \"Dishonored 2 is an excellent and well-made first-person stealth assassination game.\u201c\n\nDishonored 2 inherits many of the great elements of its previous game(Dishonored, 2012) from its series in general and its overall quality has been improved and elaborated.\n\nWhile its gameplay has inherited the previous game in general, it has set two playable characters and added several abilities. The graphics are greatly improved, and the overall map design is really good too. Also, the real beauty of this game is that it can be played in various ways depending on gamers\u2019 play-styles. You can be a terrifying assassin through stealth and assassination play, or you can be the best gladiator in the empire who simultaneously exterminates multiple enemies with his/her skills. In addition, there are various equipment and weapons such as knife, pistol, crossbow, grenades, and spring razor etc, making it possible to complete missions in a variety of ways depending on the player's level and play-style.\n\nAnd its story is really interesting. It was attractive enough to make a story into a novel, such as unique characters, dramatic turns of events, interesting mysteries, and the protagonist who solves them, which greatly contributed to improving players' immersion in the game.\n\nPersonally, I think Chapter 4(The Clockwork Mansion) and Chapter 7(A Crack in the Slab) are true masterpieces of this game. They are creative, impressive, and memorable missions that I think deserve a standing ovation if they were a performance. I think they\u2019re the stages that represent this game.\n\nIts soundtracks and background musics are also excellent enough to increase players concentration. I really hope the next game of its series will be released.\n\nIn conclusion, as the previous game was a well-made masterpiece too, it is remarkable that Dishonored 2 has inherited its previous game really well.

It forever holds a special place in my heart. I have not played a game with this much freedom and with this many ways to go about completing objectives. I am a stealth maniac so it felt right at home for me. The sheer detail to each of the levels and how the world looks is undeniably one of its strongest points.\n\nStealth is amazing as well combined with the game's power mechanics. I tried my very best to stealth and get the ghost achievement for each of the levels. However the downside to this is that it becomes very disengaging over time. Honestly after achieving complete stealth, it felt as a dis-service to the game for me to do it ever again. Also the other thing I do not like is that stealth or non lethal is the way to get the good ending which handicaps me from exploring other options.\n\nLoud or lethal combat is unlike any other, with really cool counter finishers and power abilities. I want to play this game with lethal combat but the game punishes me by giving me a bad ending. With the loud approach, the sky is the limit in terms of how creatively you want to take down the enemy/ies. However it requires a lot of effort and multitasking to achieve stylish skills with your abilities so do not expect to be amazing at it off the rip.\n\nStory is quite lacking and is my biggest complaint with the game. It felt quite short and not enough events happened. I do not want to spoil it but I would not bank on buying this game for having a good narrative experience.

After finally playing this game, I can say I'm just a little unimpressed. It's a good game, don't get me wrong, but DH2 is undeniably shorter than the first game. The world design, a staple of the original game, felt somehow dated and bland in this sequel. During some missions, I found myself noticing map fragments which were directly lifted from other missions, breaking immersion on a few occasions (and I'm not talking about the black market shops). The story is a bit too predictable, though they definitely tried to improve it by [spoiler] adding branching timelines [/spoiler] and guiding the player through the missions. The issue is that the game oscillates between holding the players hand through every little action and leaving the player wandering for minutes about how to use some poorly-explained game mechanic. Also, I really did not enjoy the way they rebooted the outsiders design and mannerisms. He went from being a mysterious G-man type character to an edgy young adult who never outgrew his goth phase. \n\nNow that I've finished with my points of contention, I have to sing some praises. Dishonored, as a franchise, has some of the best navigation and level design ever. You really feel like an occult shadow assassin as you explore the limits of this beautiful open world. The fictional world that this game creates is endearing and dynamic, even though the entire game takes place in just two cities. The magic system got a major boost, though I found myself uninterested in most of the new offers, preferring to stick with the old mechanics. The bone charm crafting system was really cool, but I never found a use for it, because by the time I gathered enough bone charms, the game was already over. The option to play as Emily or Corvo is a welcome addition to the game (though I think story works best with Emily as the MC). The higher-level NPC characters, with whom you interact, mostly have good stories to tell.  If you really want to enjoy this game, ready EVERYTHING. There is so much hidden lore and information within documents and books spread throughout the world. My only complaint was that my eyes were hurting by the end of the play through. \n\nTL;DR Dishonored 2 is a good game. It has a beautiful, expansive world and enjoyable movement system, but often falls flat on aspects like mission flow/continuity. Despite trying to resolve classic Dishonored 1 character storylines, it ultimately fails to leave the player with that lasting feeling of resolution. At the end of this game, you might be left wondering, \"huh...is that it?\" If you enjoyed Dishonored 1 and find this on sale, you should pick it up and explore the world of Dishonored.", "timestamp_created": 1697008546, "timestamp_updated": 1697008546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148006172": {"recommendationid": "148006172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056926450", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 3752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1378, "last_played": 1697518180}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1696990299, "timestamp_updated": 1696990299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462427735328674316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148003239": {"recommendationid": "148003239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003369290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2917, "last_played": 1696984590}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent sneaky game.

Perhaps a bit too similar, though. This means it's a very good game, and again I had fun with the mix of stealth and exploration. But it's basically more of the same. Ok, there is the twist that you may play with two characters, which adds... well... even more of the same!\n\nThe gameplay in general is also repetivive. You will basically do the same thing from first to last mission (only the seventh brings something new). I played the last two missions mostly to just finish the game, since I was a bit bored by that time. So my little good girl Emily got a bit more murderous and chaotic, and that was a bit refreshing. Perhaps one day I'll do a high-chaos playthrough with Corvo, but unfortunately the game actively punishes you for this kind of gameplay. This goes against the spirit of immersive sims: it gives you the toys, but tells you to not use them. Sure there should be consequences for each kind of playstyle, but also some advantages. The only disadvantage of playing non-lethally is that unconscious enemies can be awakened, but that hapenned just a couple of times in my 40-hour playthrough. Well, Dishonored was always a bit more straightforward, more Thief than Deus Ex. And, in any case,  playing the whole game Rambo-style should also wears down after a while.\n\nI must add something that doesn't seem to be a problem for most, but strongly spoiled my playthrough: a simple and m***nic aesthetic decision to make ALL text and UI interfaces to sway from one side to another, with no option to turn it off (believe, I've dug deep for a solution). It's like reading a book in a boat on rough waters. If you are prone to motion sickness, this makes all text unreadable. Fortunately the game is easy enough that you may just follow objective markers, but you'll have to skip all lore, and so a great part of the immersion goes away. This gives me a new respect for developers that add accessability options to their games.\n\nAll in all, given the shortage of immersive sims in the market, it's still a worthy option, but the least interesting Arkane game I played so far.

It represents a severe limitation in innovation or creatively. It is borderline a strictly worse version of the first game. \n\nThe original Dishonored had a Spawn, Faustian story. Your wife is murdered, daughter is kidnapped, devil characters gives you super powers to take revenge or set things right. You team up with a cast of characters who act as your support at base; they all have their own goals and ambitions. For what it is, it's a well done story. \n\nIn Dishonered 2, despite being a carbon copy of the original, the story telling is epileptic from the start. There is no game play to establish relationships or let the player make their own conclusions. It just starts with this big bombastic cutscene where evil people that we don't know are doing evil things. . . for some reason. And when I picked the original character from the 1st game to play as, the narrative was clearly not designed for that. They really needed to tweak the opening based on your choice, but that requires work and the result is somewhat laughable with the vilainn knocking you over the head and putting you in a locked room. I'm the guy who single handily saved the kingdom and is extremely lethal. \n\nFrom there, things devolve a bit more. You have a base of operations, but it isn't filled with characters. You're pretty much on your own, and while it seemed to hint at building up a sort of crew, that's never really happens. It's just so sparse.\n\nThen we get to the second Mission where I say there just wasn't writing and directing talent involved in the creation of this game. The narrative thrust after the inciting incident may as well have been a completely unrelated side quest. It references to some killer that is framing the main character, but we don't have any relationship to them. We don't know them. The game doesn't even do an adequate job to cement the \"framing\" as more than rumor. We just have to accept it because the game is insistent on it. And here's where I get on my soap box, because the narrative shifts after two missions to finding your long lost friend who has gone missing in enemy territory. \n\nTHAT is a good place to start the story in earnest. Instead, we're running after a random person who's relationship is unclear, and we only find them by complete happenstance. Wouldn't it have been much more interesting to try and find our friend and along the way stumble upon this conspiracy? The frame work for this game is bumbling incompetence ad naseum. \n\nAnd here's where I talk about the game play. Yes it's a carbon copy of the original, BUT the original had some glaring flaws. It was a great game, but it had room to improve; that's why this is so frustrating. Much like Dishonored 2, the original's action and \"evil\" path was undeveloped. Both games shine when using stealth and finding clever paths and secrets. The violent option is still just a short cut that removes the meat of the content. \n\nAll that's done here is more enemies being thrown at you. If the intent was to force stealth murder play, it fails because the action parts are so easy. And if the goal was to create more of a challenge for the straight forward approach, it fails because it's too easy. \n\nDoes it do anything better? Yes. This game comes through in a big way with two specific levels. I'm not too big of a fan of most of the stages more for reasons of the way they resolve and you are expected to engage with them (the game is arguably more binary in terms of how the missions play out), BUT there are two genuinely jaw dropping levels that are probably worth the price of admission. \n\nOVERALL, Dishonored 2 is either a lazy or incompetent clone, and I'm not sitting down to follow that blame tree to its roots. As someone who very much enjoyed the first entry, I would have loved to see this take those ideas to the next level or even attempt a step in any direction. \n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1696738565, "timestamp_updated": 1696738565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516644477844238281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147829877": {"recommendationid": "147829877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202046408", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 329, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1696485338}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Dishonored 2 nos sumerge una vez m\u00e1s en el oscuro y cautivador mundo de Karnaca, con su intrigante historia y su jugabilidad innovadora.

It's still an amazing game, just not the successor I hoped it'd be. \n\nFirst of all, my problem was the repetitiveness. Only if you play as Emily you can have a little bit different experience, Corvo stays the same even though his mark was taken away and it could easily lead to some new powers, something The Outsider might alter/enhance to help fight against Delilah, but nah\u2014the same 6 options with just a little bit more upgrades, making playing as Corvo feel like it's a big DLC rather than a sequel (even playing as Daud felt different). Then, this problem leads to the next one\u2014the lack of the world's development as the game takes place 15 years after the original story. The technologies are the same: Walls of Light, Arc Pylons, Watchtowers, gunpowder pistols, crossbows, grenades, mines, etc. Yes, the weapons do have more upgrades now, just as the powers do, but is it really the development of 15 in-game years with geniuses like Sokolov and Jindosh? Makes little sense to me. The enemies suffer from the same problem, as all the new types just substitute some of the previous ones: Clockwork Soldiers for Tallboys as the elite enemy type, Howlers for Hatters as the gang enemy type, and Witches for Assassins as... the occasional assassin type? The latter is no particularly different from The Knife of Dunwall and Brightmore Witches, though. Overseers are there but are now more boring (no music boxes). However, what absolutely stunned me was how they introduced Bloodflies as a rat swarm alternative. This feels like a terrible and forced feature in every way: rats were closely connected to the original story, as well as made the Chaos system logical; bloodflies are just a poor copy-paste, partially combined with River Krusts (area-fixed hives with a possibility of loot dropped upon destruction), just because, uhm, well, we had to substitute rats with something, right? I feel like civilians helping or disturbing you based on your Chaos level would be a better choice than a blatant reskin. The story is a major letdown as well, but at least the lore (audiographs, books, and notes) was enjoyable.\n\nBut hey, it may be worse than D1 in my book, but there is a thing in D2 that amazed me\u2014those two exact levels I'm confident to call the best in the franchise so far (haven't played DOTO yet). And while I still think that the average consistency of level design is better in D1 (and DLCs), in which every level is almost equally as good, D2 peaked with The Clockwork Mansion and A Crack in the Slab. I also admire the love for details, whether it's [spoiler]the consequences of preventing Aramis Stilton from ruining his life[/spoiler] or [spoiler]finding that iconic secret room from the original.[/spoiler][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1696179369, "timestamp_updated": 1696179369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147435958": {"recommendationid": "147435958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023633855", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 15022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12286, "last_played": 1699423106}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good game-play challenging but not aggravating-ability to save always a plus-enjoyed it -played both characters - a game you can play over again-I don't easily praise this deserves it it has all the elements that creates an interesting story line with good game play- recommended for all ages", "timestamp_created": 1696168274, "timestamp_updated": 1696168274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147392905": {"recommendationid": "147392905", "author": {"steamid": "76561199003413848", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 3667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3665, "last_played": 1696741531}, "language": "english", "review": "its alright", "timestamp_created": 1696114754, "timestamp_updated": 1696114754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147362226": {"recommendationid": "147362226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282485397", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1023, "last_played": 1695866041}, "language": "english", "review": "Another exceptional installment of the Dishonored franchise.

For a casual run though, you can live entirely without any runes or charms honestly.\n\nThe Bad: > Emily's powers aren't as fun. Her best one is Domino which links multiple targets fates up to 4 for 1.\n>Her version of blink is a shadow hand that pulls you to target which doubles as a enemy grabber (and items though this never worked the 2 times I needed it, mainly used for lethal runs to grab whale juice I guess)\n>The ending (Low Chaos for me) is by the book expected and basic and sadly does not explain fates of certain areas you made choices in which must mean they relied on newspapers etc to reveal those but this game is EXHAUSTIVE with text so I started ignoring all that.\n\nThe Good: Everything you liked from the first one. Plain and simple. Nothing new except blood flies and no more zombie-like people. For those who like playing games super efficiently and collecting everything and crafting the best buff combos etc, you'll have a ball with the optional bonecharm crafting system (you break them down to single out their ability and then rebuild them with stacked abilities so they only take 1 slot so you can eventually have 4 times more max buffs.)\n", "timestamp_created": 1695952770, "timestamp_updated": 1695952770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147238150": {"recommendationid": "147238150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969657705", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 678, "last_played": 1698982099}, "language": "english", "review": "k", "timestamp_created": 1695936434, "timestamp_updated": 1695936434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147238077": {"recommendationid": "147238077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106976990", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1320, "last_played": 1695936300}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Que bendici\u00f3n de juego", "timestamp_created": 1695936346, "timestamp_updated": 1695936346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147236211": {"recommendationid": "147236211", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979815344", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2144, "last_played": 1696620087}, "language": "english", "review": "A masterpiece, surpassing the first one.

I've played it countless times and I'm definitely going to play it again and try some new tactics.\noverall, wonderful graphics, great story, good voice acting, unique mechanics, and lots of stuff to explore. it came out years ago, but it never feels dated in its graphics or presentation which is why I keep coming back. all in all, 10/10. very much recommend!!!", "timestamp_created": 1695340403, "timestamp_updated": 1695340403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146744856": {"recommendationid": "146744856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083225118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 7306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6422, "last_played": 1696380323}, "language": "english", "review": "Still one of the best, but sorta underrated action/stealth games out there.

If you are not appreciative of the first 'Dishonored' though, it may be a different story.\n'Dishonored 2' is the follow-up to a surprise success and expectations were high for it, very high. It didn't quite meet these expectations and it wasn't a big commercial success either. The add-on 'Death of the Outsider' is by far the best part this instalment has to offer, and obviously you have to know the whole story to make sense of that final part. So let me break down 'Dishonored 2's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nPRO\n- interesting revenge tale, even if a little bit convoluted\n- fantastic level design, as Arkane always has (up to 'Deathloop' that is), this alone is actually quite worth the price of admission\n- tense atmosphere and world building\n- intricate quest design\n- varied gameplay offers different solutions to reach your goals\n- nice RPG-mechanics\n- removing Denuvo (&%$$!!?!!\"/&&) really helped the game to run better\n\nNEG\n- the game was riddled with technical problems on release, some of them have only been worked around and not really been solved\n- vertical gameplay, the first title's strength, has been trimmed down significantly - and this is one of the items which totally escape me\n- although Karnaca is very interesting, the change of location has never convinced me\n- some of the characters are cartoonish, and the dialogue script is not up to par with the first instalment\n- some aspects are re-hashes in new contexts, e.g. the first 'Dishonored' had a rat plague, the second has a bloodfly infestation\n- extremely ambitious without totally delivering, i.e. there is some great potential being wasted \n\n'Dishonored 2' is more of everything its predecessor had to offer.

Examples are: one collectible that requires you to break a wooden plank but ONLY with a crossbow bolt -anything else will NOT break the plank-, many keys that are hidden in random spots in the map, and thus if you find them you can get the collectible, but if you know where the collectible is no clues are given to where to find the keys, one shop rob were you must find a wheel and place it in a place where it doesn't seem to belong, etc. On the other hand, the main history puzzles are well thought and actually require ingenuity to be solved.\n\n3. The game is only half thought for a run with markers disabled (Again, 95% of the cases only related to secondary stuff, not the main questline). By this, I refer to characters telling you to met in X without giving you any indications on where X is, being told to go get some stuff in X without indications, etc. This gets quite annoying sometimes, specially in runs where you don't want to be spotted.\n\n4. The final negative point would be that the AI is worse than in the first entry -the only part where the game performs worse than its predecessor-. Some enemies will go where YOU are when you throw an object that makes sound instead of where the object falls, some enemies will clearly spot you, then run away and lose track of you, some civilians will spot you where you aren't supposed to be and will only get mildly infuriated even tough they should call the guards if you remain X seconds in their LOS, etc. This point might be the least infuriating of them all, but it is annoying nevertheless.\n\nClearly, the pros outweigh the cons, and by all means this is one of those games that deserves to be bought even without a discount, as it is a masterpiece and time will fly by when you play it, and you will play it more than once, because it has at least 24 paths, albeit realistically with 20 you have already seen everything : Corvo: NO spots, NO kills, powers; Corvo: NO spots, kills, powers; Corvo: spots, kills, powers; Corvo: play normally without going for anything in particular but with powers. Then the same 4 scenarios again but without powers, and then the same 8 previous scenarios but with Emily. Finally, all the previous scenarios but in the NG+ mode. Of course, practically no one is going to play this much, but doing at least 3-4 runs would be normal, as the game has much to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1695143893, "timestamp_updated": 1695144151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146590868": {"recommendationid": "146590868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269428786", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1695151959}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The campaign is markedly shorter  but there's definitely potential replay value considering you have two main characters instead of 1. The game also prioritizes stealth still, but there's a lot more opportunity for playing a violent non-stealthy approach, and this approach is even encouraged with a few of the enemy types. No longer, also, is a non-lethal approach truly vital for having a good end-game experience. It's moreso just for bragging rights and achievements, although non-lethal assassinations of the targets definitely changes the epilogue slideshow. It's nothing like the... stuff that Samuel can do in the first game if you aren't a kind individual.\n\nLike all Arkane games there are definitely a variety of approaches to every obstacle, however I definitely disliked how there were multiple sections that were just plain openly linear, such as one area with the clockwork soldiers.

As a sequel to the critically acclaimed Dishonored, this game not only lives up to its predecessor's legacy but surpasses it in every way imaginable.\n\nSet in the beautifully crafted, dystopian world of the Empire of the Isles, \"Dishonored 2\" takes players on an unforgettable journey filled with political intrigue, supernatural powers, and moral choices that leave a lasting impact on the game's richly woven narrative. From the moment you step into this steampunk-inspired world, you're immersed in a breathtakingly detailed and atmospheric setting that feels alive with history and mystery.\n\nOne of the game's standout features is its dual protagonist system. Players can choose to take on the role of either Emily Kaldwin, the rightful Empress of the Isles, or Corvo Attano, the protagonist of the first game. Each character offers a unique set of supernatural abilities and play-styles, allowing for diverse approaches to missions and objectives. Emily's powers focus on manipulating time and using shadowy tactics, while Corvo retains his iconic suite of abilities from the first game, enhanced and augmented for even more creative assassinations.\n\nThe level design in \"Dishonored 2\" is a true work of art. Every mission is a mini-masterpiece, with intricately designed environments that offer countless paths, hidden secrets, and alternative routes to achieve your goals. Whether you're navigating the grandiose halls of the Clockwork Mansion, exploring the grimy underbelly of Karnaca, or infiltrating a mysterious cult's compound, the world feels like a living, breathing entity, responding dynamically to your choices.\n\nThe heart and soul of \"Dishonored 2\" is the moral quandary it presents to players. Your choices throughout the game affect not only the narrative but also the world around you. The \"chaos\" system returns, with your actions determining the fate of the Empire. Will you choose the path of ruthless vengeance, leaving a trail of death and destruction in your wake, or will you opt for a more merciful approach, seeking justice while minimizing collateral damage? The consequences of your decisions are brilliantly reflected in the story's multiple endings, making each play-through a unique experience.\n\nThe depth of \"Dishonored 2's\" game-play mechanics is staggering. The supernatural abilities at your disposal, combined with an arsenal of inventive gadgets and weapons, encourage experimentation and creativity. Whether you're teleporting through time and space, summoning deadly assassins, or using the iconic Blink ability to traverse rooftops and evade enemies, the game-play is a sheer delight for fans of stealth-action.\n\nVisually, \"Dishonored 2\" is a work of art. The art direction, character designs, and the overall aesthetic are breathtaking. The game runs smoothly and looks stunning even on mid-range hardware, making it accessible to a wide range of players.\n\nThe audio design is equally remarkable, with a hauntingly beautiful score that sets the mood perfectly and impeccable voice acting that brings the characters to life. The soundscapes of the Empire of the Isles are filled with the bustling of city streets, eerie whispers of supernatural forces, and the distant cries of seagulls, immersing you completely in the game's world.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Dishonored 2\" is a spectacular triumph of game design, storytelling, and player agency. It offers an immersive experience that rewards creativity, strategic thinking, and moral reflection. Whether you're a fan of stealth games, immersive worlds, or captivating narratives, \"Dishonored 2\" is an absolute must-play title that stands as a shining example of what the medium can achieve. Dive into its world, make your choices, and discover the true essence of gaming excellence. Arkane Studios has once again proven themselves as masters of their craft, and \"Dishonored 2\" is a testament to their unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling.", "timestamp_created": 1693704513, "timestamp_updated": 1693704513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145548768": {"recommendationid": "145548768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257474459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4445, "last_played": 1634771494}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is a must, best chapter of the saga!", "timestamp_created": 1693687328, "timestamp_updated": 1693687328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145525787": {"recommendationid": "145525787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418482098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1694005597}, "language": "english", "review": "sfefsed", "timestamp_created": 1693665035, "timestamp_updated": 1693665035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494166076183319092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145521259": {"recommendationid": "145521259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341164899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1587, "last_played": 1694473304}, "language": "english", "review": "a lot like the first only better", "timestamp_created": 1693660568, "timestamp_updated": 1693660568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145495740": {"recommendationid": "145495740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083449187", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 304, "playtime_forever": 1145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1145, "last_played": 1693626035}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1693626052, "timestamp_updated": 1693626052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709930300712585449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145494963": {"recommendationid": "145494963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081805672", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1975, "last_played": 1699131130}, "language": "english", "review": "top", "timestamp_created": 1693624930, "timestamp_updated": 1693624930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145491599": {"recommendationid": "145491599", "author": {"steamid": "76561199107586289", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 882, "last_played": 1697912228}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

A few main points that stick out are the dialogue, the level design, music and worldbuilding. \nThe dialogue gives the game a character that not many major releases can reproduce. While it is not some cinematic master piece, it perfectly fits the overal theme of the game. I never had a real 'dislike' of any of the characters that was not intended, no characters were annoying. The idle dialogue of a lot of the npc's can also actually be very entertaining. Both main characters also have more dialogue on the current situation then Dishonored one, however Emily Kaldwin certaintly seems more fleshed out in that regard. To me it seems that Emily is made for the first playthrough and Corvo is for a second one.\nArkane Studios has always been amazing at level design, and this does not change. Every problem has 50 ways of approaching it, with the runes only reinforcing this design. My personal strategy was picking people off one by one with Emily's 'grab' ability, however there are truely strategies fit for everyone. Pay close attention to the level, and one might even find a few secret runes and coins. While i skipped a few runes, i am sure that if i put the time in the exploration would not have dissapointed me.\nThe music is extremely thematic and the game would not be the same without it. The ending credits themes are all in my regular playlists and the ambient songs are on par with Skyrim in quality. I honestly suggest checking out the OST for this game.\nLastly for the upsides, there is the worldbuilding. Through the dialogue of Emily, Corvo and the other characters you learn quite a lot. However the environment teachers you even more about the world of Dishonored. Many hidden rooms have entire stories connected to them, often shown with diary entries, markings on the walls and other environmental things. Another upside is that for the people not interested, this can easily be skipped, however i spent a lot of my time simply reading the letters and notes other people left around.\nOne MAJOR downside is that the witches and one certain door are infuriating in the pacifist playthrough. The witches are immune to many of your tricks, meaning you have to load a save many times when spotted. The door (TM) you'll know when you see it. There is a riddle connected to it which me and 2 friends spent atleast an hour on before giving up. It is randomised, so a program is needed to decypher it. If you enjoy longwinded riddles then do that, but honestly for many others just look it up online with a decoding program (yes, the community made them for this specific puzzle).\nA few other minor gripes include that falldamage seems insane for npc's, meaning i many times had to load saves when i drop them like a meter from a ledge to hide a corpse. However overal the non-pacifist run honestly fixes many problems.\n\nIf you enjoyed Dishonored then dishonored 2 is honestly just more of the same with expanded game mechanics. \nIt would honestly be a 9/10 if the riddle and the witches did not exist. They simply do not allow me to give it that high, as they taint the last third of the game. The 'time' level also i do not like. Therefor i'll sadly have to lower it to a 7.0\nIn no way a bad game, however there a few gameplay flaws that taint the pacifist route (In my opinion the 'intended' way to play)", "timestamp_created": 1693231353, "timestamp_updated": 1693231353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145197985": {"recommendationid": "145197985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030850410", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6760, "last_played": 1693754051}, "language": "english", "review": "Hands down, one of my Top 5 games of all time.

It is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Dishonored, which was released in 2012. Dishonored 2 takes place 15 years after the events of the first game, and lets you choose between playing as Emily Kaldwin, the deposed empress of Dunwall, or Corvo Attano, her father and royal protector. Both characters have their own unique set of supernatural abilities that allow them to manipulate the world and their enemies in creative ways. The game is set in the fictional empire of the Isles, which is inspired by various historical and cultural influences, such as Victorian London, Renaissance Italy, and steampunk aesthetics. The game features a rich and detailed world that reacts to your choices and actions, creating a dynamic and emergent game play experience. You can explore the city of Karnaca, a coastal metropolis that is plagued by corruption, disease, and civil unrest. You can interact with various factions, characters, and environments that will shape your story and your destiny. The game also offers a high level of replay-ability, as you can experiment with different powers, weapons, gadgets, and play-styles. You can choose to be stealthy or aggressive, lethal or non-lethal, chaotic or orderly. The game adapts to your decisions and changes the outcome of the missions and the overall narrative. You can also customize your difficulty level and toggle various options that will affect the game-play and the challenge. Dishonored 2 is a game that delivers on its promise of giving you a lot of freedom and agency in how you approach each situation. It is a game that respects your intelligence and creativity, and rewards you with a satisfying and memorable experience. It is one of the best games of its genre, and one of the best games of all time. The game features a new-game plus mode also, something fans of the first game begged for, as well as a real-time counter of if you were spotted or accidentally killed someone during one of the ghost runs (proper annoying when it says you killed someone at the end of a mission even though you know damn well you didn't, but the game allows you to check this regularly as opposed to the end of the game, so you can just reload the save). One of the most memorable missions in Dishonored 2 is the seventh one, called A Crack in the Slab. In this mission, you travel to the ruined mansion of Aramis Stilton, a former ally who went mad after hosting a seance with your enemies. There, you find a device that lets you travel back and forth between the present and the past, where the mansion is still intact and inhabited by guards and guests. You can use this device to manipulate the environment, bypass obstacles, and alter the course of history. Moreover, the game does this in the Void engine, a game made and managed by Arkane, whilst not losing performance. This is very impressive as the game stacks the two levels (present and past) on top of each other so that you can seamlessly switch between them. This down not drop performance in the slightest, which is impressive to say the least. In short, this game is amazing. It would be a shame not to play it as you would miss out on the lore, atmosphere, music and brand-new abilities introduced into the game.  I implore you, please, play this game.

Larger and more diverse maps. Clockwork mansion and Stilton's Manor are absolute gems. Between the choices to play as Corvo or Emily, lethal or non-lethal options to deal with enemies, and loud or quiet ways to handle every situation, there are a lot of different possible play styles. The ability to deeply upgrade your powers or not dedicate any runes to powers you're not interested in means you can play exactly the way you most enjoy. This game offers a lot of content. But, its very easy to ignore. On my first playthrough, I solely focused on the main story objectives. I ignored runes, bonecharms, paintings, safes, etc. I didn't like it at all. Years later, I replayed and completed all of the optional side-tasks. Those tasks often led to the most memorable and interesting moments. So, buy it, enjoy the game, and don't forget to take your time.

Dishonored 1's story wasn't anything amazing but it had spectacle and there were many memorable characters. This games story is just ok.\n\n*The game forces depth of field every time I reload a save. I had to create a bind to make it stop. Not a huge deal but it gets on my nerves.\n\nClosing Thoughts:\nA worthy sequel to Dishonored. The biggest drawback for me is the performance.

I plan on replaying some other time. Still, based off of that I would say the game was enjoyable. I think the main thing they did better in this game was the enemies/fighting.\n\nThe story was okay. It was good enough to keep me interested, but it lacked the emotion the first game had. I also wasn't interested in any of the side characters.\n\nThe gameplay is where I think this game shines. As Emily you get a new set of powers that still allow a stealthy or loud approach. Each level is good at providing multiple routes for any kind of strategy you want to do. There's a few new enemies added, the robotic clockwork soldiers being the most interesting one. I actually really enjoyed fighting them. They were the right of amount of challenging that I felt like I want to avoid them most the time but still interesting enough to not immediately run anytime I engaged with them.\n\nIt's a little less optimized and stable than the first. As a low-end PC user I was getting like 40ish fps on the lowest settings. I ran into like no bugs though. People have said it's really buggy but I somehow ran into 0. Idk maybe I just got lucky.\n\nOverall great game.

Another great thing abt this game is that you dont need to know the story of the original to understand but unfortunately, the other bad thing abt this game is the narrative is ridiculously similar to the original.   \n\n\n\nI remember laughing in the karnaca mission where its daytime and i overhead the civilians talking abt how the grand guard doesn't employ too much women in their army but there are female guards in the game, unlike in the original where they are just witches", "timestamp_created": 1690890150, "timestamp_updated": 1690890150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143181421": {"recommendationid": "143181421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233754472", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1206, "last_played": 1684601689}, "language": "english", "review": "rat sorcery exisits", "timestamp_created": 1690859722, "timestamp_updated": 1699123940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143168130": {"recommendationid": "143168130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198828462261", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1692817621}, "language": "english", "review": "first one was better, still a quality game\n", "timestamp_created": 1690838651, "timestamp_updated": 1690838651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143164987": {"recommendationid": "143164987", "author": {"steamid": "76561199099547987", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1693795786}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta bueno, lo recomiendo", "timestamp_created": 1690834737, "timestamp_updated": 1690834737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143155215": {"recommendationid": "143155215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062280548", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1258, "last_played": 1690993165}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10\n\nSuch pretty art direction and environments.

Being able to play as either Corvo or Emily was a good choice and having them use different powers was a good choice. It is easily playable in different ways (low or high chaos, weapons or powers, no powers, etc) which adds a lot of choices on how to play. The levels are also really interesting and full of things to find and different paths through the level. The graphics look great even on my mid-tier pc although I was a little disappointed that the art style of the first one was abandoned. The story is fine, it doesnt do anything too interesting but its good enough. \n\nThe only real negatives for me was the fact that the chaos system was heavily watered down from the first game which made the difference in high and low chaos unnoticeable. That was a huge shame as the first game did a good job of changing the world in response to your chaos level and 2 had none of that.

You can go about an absolute psychotic rampage of murder and chaos, turning your surroundings into creepily infested ruins, or avoid murder and keep everything nice while possibly challenging yourself to avoid being seen even once the whole game by enemies. The morality system does not lock you either way and you can even shift to the other side mid-game with effort. There are so many different secrets that directly affect your route through the game that even recently I've discovered yet another secret I hadn't found in my 168 previous hours of playing.\n\nEven the achievements are almost all about giving you something new to do in future runs instead of just giving you some daunting or annoying task to take up your time. All in all, I'd say the average player can go through this game over 10 times fully with the intent to explore new things every time and still not see it all. \nFrom the routes through levels, to the objectives, to the powers and equipment, to the upgrades for them, to the world and its various events that you can witness by just being in the right spot, this game will eat up your free time and you will love every hour of it.\nP.S. this goes without saying but I believe every entry in this series is deserving of the same praise and I'd fully recommend the first game, it's 2 dlc stories

Although the game is no longer new, it still looks fresh and beautiful. After completing the first part - I immediately moved on to the passage of the second and this game exceeded my expectations.\n\n[h1] Main Plot [/h1]\n\nIn this part the main opponent is an opponent from first DLC. You are able to choose who you will play for - Corvo (the main character of previous part) or his daughter - princess. In reality it almost doesn\u2019t matter who you will play for, because there is no difference in locations or dialogues. \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay in mechanics fully transfer mechanics from first part. The most interesting and new is happening in locations. All locations are new and don\u2019t repeat first part. Arcane Studio worked very well with puzzles, and they are very interesting, the most interesting for me was the puzzle with ladies in different skirts, I spent around an hour to solve it. In one location you need to be in technical palace, where each movement may be seen by the owner. Other palace you need to pass by traveling in time, and places which are closed in past are open in real time.\n\nFor those who have seen everything, and do believe, that it will be to easy may chose to play without magic.\n\n[h1] Magic without Outsiders mark [/h1]\n\n[u] Steam Deck [/u]\n\nMany years past since Dishonored 2 has been released, but still games optimization could be much better. As previous part - this game fully has been past in Steam Deck, and this time the load on the hardware was insane, although the decanter doesn't look that outstanding, and even on low settings the game consumed a lot of resources. After playing around with the settings, you can still achieve the desired result and reduce the load on the hardware so that the game does not lose anything in quality and speed. However, it doesn't look like a finished product. But need to tell that I haven\u2019t got any game crash during my gameplay.\n\n[u] FPS issues [/u]\n\nAs well need to tell, that there is also a critical bug that underlies this game - if you use FPS lock in system, then be ready, that level may launch for 5-15 minutes. The most interesting, that ingame FPS lock (not in PC system) doesn\u2019t make such problem and all game levels launch very quickly.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nThe game looks very good, levels designed very cool, and level innovations are awesome. I enjoyed this part much more then the first Dishonored. Even with all technical issues Dishonored 2 is a good game and I do believe, if you give this game a choice - you may get pleasure from this gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1689619140, "timestamp_updated": 1689619140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142270273": {"recommendationid": "142270273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322047942", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 2093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2093, "last_played": 1689604240}, "language": "english", "review": "8.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1689604867, "timestamp_updated": 1689604953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142260953": {"recommendationid": "142260953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255865647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 635, "last_played": 1690550174}, "language": "english", "review": "Killing is my Business..and Business is Good.", "timestamp_created": 1689593163, "timestamp_updated": 1689593163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142260385": {"recommendationid": "142260385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124814374", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2521, "last_played": 1688735505}, "language": "english", "review": "Dishonored 3 when", "timestamp_created": 1689592371, "timestamp_updated": 1689592371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142245997": {"recommendationid": "142245997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062509816", "num_games_owned": 931, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 2532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2529, "last_played": 1690992751}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty much one of the best Stealth games I've ever played.\n\nGreat amount of tools and options to both be an undetected ghost and a dark assassin.

And all of it wrapped in such striking & interesting visuals. All the praise for the art style in this game. It really is outstanding. Plus the whole mythos the game world plays in is so intriguing. It makes me want to look for side materials to read both in game and out of the game.

As far as additions go, that weren\u2019t introduced in the Daud DLC, having two characters does add a lot and encourages replaying the game, also having the Garrett VA voice Corvo is great fanservice. Another addition, clockwork soldiers, are a mixed bag, they are very different from normal enemies and require more elaborate strategies to be dealt with but they can also be extremely annoying especially with their long range 360 degree vision. As far as the levels go there are some that are distinct like the clockwork mansion and the time travel mansion but in general I don\u2019t think most of the levels are very distinguishable from each other or from the levels from the first game, in fact I feel like the levels in Dishonored 1 are more unique in general. Even as someone who wasn\u2019t very invested in the story and lore of Dishonored 1 I can\u2019t deny that the story in Dishonored 2 is worse, they bring back the villain from the Daud DLC which wasn\u2019t even that interesting and make her the antagonist again. There aren\u2019t as many characters at all and even less new ones, and instead of taking place in Dunwall we\u2019re dragged elsewhere despite the start of the game and main goal being to restore the throne, it just feels like all the characters are being dragged through this plot and you\u2019re also there. My biggest problem with this game is that it simply doesn\u2019t improve on the previous game\u2019s formula enough, any criticism related to lack of incentive to engage meaningfully with the sandbox still applies to this game, and enemies, mechanics, even level design remain largely the same.", "timestamp_created": 1689289209, "timestamp_updated": 1689289209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141998148": {"recommendationid": "141998148", "author": {"steamid": "76561199438639272", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "playtime_at_review": 4181, "last_played": 1699752695}, "language": "english", "review": "This game taught me good fighting skills.

Most of the time, the \"what if\" ideas don't pan out, but when they do, you'll feel clever for discovering them, and this fuels you to keep experimenting.\n\n[b]Art direction[/b]\nThe same familiar art style from the first game returns here with a tropical twist. Gone are the dull industrial colors and depressing mood of Dunwall. Some people lament the missing dystopic atmosphere of Dunwall, but I don't think that's necessarily a problem. Things aren't exactly looking up in Karnaca either, it's dystopic in a different way.\n\n[b]Voiced protagonist[/b]\nNot particularly a high bar to cross, but I preferred the voiced protagonists to the first game's silent Corvo. The protagonist commenting on the surroundings was a nice subtle way to introduce lore and personality to the environment, and since there are two possible characters to pick from, you'll get multiple perspectives.\n\n\n[h1]Gripes[/h1]\n\n[b]Ending[/b]\nThe ending of the game was disappointing. The post-campaign summary is very short, about 2-4 Powerpoint slides long. Don't get me wrong, the slide presentation is nice and all, but I would've preferred more slides summarizing my actions and their results, even if the visual quality would've been lesser for it.\n\n[b]Voiced protagonist[/b]\nThere are oftentimes situations where I would expect the protagonist to comment on something because it's related to them, but they don't. I wonder if this is a budget problem caused by having two protagonists.\n\n[b]No neutrality[/b]\nI wish that the game had a middle ground option between the two extreme playstyles: the pacifist assassin or the complete murderhobo. You [b][i]can[/i][/b] play through the game with a medium chaos playstyle, but due to it not being an [b][i]actual[/i][/b]\u00a0option, your character's personality ends up bouncing between a sociopath and an empath. The strangest thing is that the game features a device capable of discerning if a person is despicable or not, as if encouraging stabbing of some and showing restraint for others.\n\n[b]Non-lethal combat[/b]\nThe murderhobo playthrough is perfect in its current form, it's fast, visceral, flashy and most importantly, fun. When you inevitably get spotted in the middle of your murder spree, you can just smoothly transition from a venomous snake to a feral tiger, in contrast, a non-lethal player might prefer to just reload a previous save due to the enormous risk of collateral damage in melee combat. It [b][i]is[/i][/b]\u00a0possible to do non-lethal combat but it's clunky. Most things that prime enemies to be knocked out can also cause their deaths, not to mention the enemies' complete disregard for their colleague's lives.

It runs incredibly badly, and is vulnerable to crashes. You either need a super computer, or you have to just suck it up and play on the lowest settings, along with a lowered resolution as well. \n\nCompleted as Emily on Non-Lethal\n\nThis game is both blessed and cursed. On one hand, it's a massive improvement over the first game. On the other, it has its own bag of bullsht. \n\nThe story, characters, world, and level design, are all incredibly good, it's a lot more alive and more realistic than before (for a fictional setting with magical powers, I mean it's more believable in this world). The powers you have (as Emily) are much better than in Dishonored 1, far more useful and interesting that make the game better to play, and depending on what you choose to get, it changes the way you think and play the game.\n\nHowever, when it comes to being non-lethal, the game feels like it does everything in its power to prevent it. When you're holding an NPC and trying to choke them out, other NPCs don't give a single sht and will slash at you with their swords or shoot you with their guns. Then, they'll kill the person you're holding, and for SOME REASON the game thinks YOU'RE responsible for their death. NO I AM NOT. I did not in any way, shape, or form, kill that person, and I have no reason to be punished for it. I've had to load my saves so, so many times, because enemies kept killing their friends, and I was the one punished for their deaths. I've even had to restart entire missions, twice, because I had no save file back to before I \"killed\" people. \n\nI also find it's often a bit too difficult to escape once you've been seen (in some cases, too easy). I had the bonecharm that makes you invisible when using Blink/Far Reach, but people occasionally still saw me. Using Dark Vision, I can see where people are looking. I STILL got seen by enemies WHEN THEY AREN'T EVEN LOOKING IN MY DIRECTION! WHY?! Oh, also, blueprints for upgrades aren't visible in Dark Vision for some reason and I missed so many.\n\nThey made non-lethal play a lot more fun, but also made it a massive pain to do at the same time. Most likely more enjoyable to go lethal. Overall, I'd say this game is worth it if you think you can deal with its glaring faults.\n\nEdit: \n\nOh, yeah, and every time I start up the game, I have to sit on a loading screen for around 4 minutes 30 seconds.

every single aspect of the first game (which was already almost perfect) EXCEPT:\n-the outsider's new voice is bad, the previous one was way better but he doesn't appear for more than a couple minutes every now and then therefore it's not a big issue\n-voiced protagonists have verry little nuance to them, they mainly explain what is going on around them and sometimes TRY to emote but mostly fail since every characther in these games is really monotonous; the silent protagonist of D1 was more fitting to the theme and easier to relate to; the protagonist of the D1 DLCs, Daud, only narrated the beginning of the levels and responded to dialogue, was easier to cope with since he was an already established person in the game's world with pre-determined motives and thoughts\n-after a basic understanding of the game mechanics, it becomes really easy even on the hardest difficulty; your character becomes overpowered after a couple of hours and even that is redundant since most of the game can be completed by blinking across rooftops and shooting your mission targets from a distance; i would have appreciated the higher difficulties being more populated by obstructions (guards, devices that try to stop you etc.)\n-the main thread of the plot feels a bit stretched, i will not go into detail due to spoilers but don't go into the game expecting to be blown away by twists and turns of the narrative, the game doesn't have those, and the ending is EXACTLY what you would expect after playing the game, no surprises there either, and it is mostly a setup for a secondary character that will show up in the DLC/expansion\n\nEven tho the flaws that i listed take up a lot of space (which is only because i wanted to explain them thoroughly), they don't take away much from the basic dishonored experience: supernatural assasin! the game is a lot of fun and has multiple paths to take, decisions to think about that matter, huge levels to explore, and many enemies to kill ( or avoid!

The mechanics have more depth i.e you can now move while strangling guards (I never remember doing this in the first but maybe I missed it), and the maps have some INSANE mechanics. One map has rooms that move horizontally and vertically to swap locations with other rooms making the map half a moving puzzle; and another map has a time swap-er item so you need to swap between the current destroyed version of the map and the past mint condition version of the map to avoid being caught and get to locations. Props also have more accurate \"vision boxes\" so you are no longer safe behind railings, glass doors, and windows that are 1 foot off the ground. The power system is more expansive than the first, but it is a combination of new and breaking the previous powers down into smaller upgrade-able powers which I find more convoluted. Also, rat tunnels/vents seem almost useless now which just limits the possibilities of completing missions.\nThere were also objectives which required searching a room for evidence which is boring and can end up with you leaving empty handed and frustrated because you didn't see a brown leather book on the ground under an unlit table on brown wood floors.\nThe maps are bigger and thus the missions are longer (2-3 hours) and I found myself having to continue the missions in another play session where I forgot parts of the story. The maps can be difficult to navigate especially when it's your first time playing it, and this time you can choose to be no magic so there are paths to complete the mission without magic and if you happen to chose to infiltrate through this path it ends up being boring because there isn't much use for magic. In addition, the multiple paths to infiltrate are more secretive this time around i.e 1 window on the side of a building.\nEnding is extremely mediocre, short, and very similar to the first game's ending. There are many endings, but the differences are minor, all that matters is if you finished with low or high chaos.\nOverall, they made the game systems, mechanics, and maps have more depth which just made the game harder and convoluted, but the cool map mechanics were a great addition. I just really like Dishonored so you should still play it (but the first one is better; well refined and less gimmicky).", "timestamp_created": 1688405287, "timestamp_updated": 1689050007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141220320": {"recommendationid": "141220320", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997957670", "num_games_owned": 1083, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 3192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3190, "last_played": 1690219188}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1688397016, "timestamp_updated": 1688397016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141201371": {"recommendationid": "141201371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198875857822", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1691258868}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.", "timestamp_created": 1688376788, "timestamp_updated": 1688376788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141199638": {"recommendationid": "141199638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020243093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 665, "last_played": 1688399498}, "language": "english", "review": "its ok, reminds me of half life 2", "timestamp_created": 1688374589, "timestamp_updated": 1688374589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141184797": {"recommendationid": "141184797", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977504807", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1389, "last_played": 1688955609}, "language": "english", "review": "dishonr", "timestamp_created": 1688353102, "timestamp_updated": 1688353102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782118916511535645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141178183": {"recommendationid": "141178183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189306841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2165, "last_played": 1580753429}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyful story.

A masterclass in interactive storytelling, level design, and strategic gameplay, Dishonored 2 immerses you into its captivating world of intrigue and supernatural skullduggery with an effortless grace that is hard to come by in gaming today.\n\nWhat makes Dishonored 2 such a standout sequel is its commitment to player choice. As either Emily Kaldwin, the dethroned empress, or Corvo Attano, the grizzled royal protector from the original game, you are gifted with a wide array of supernatural abilities and tools. Each character brings a unique flavor to the gameplay. Corvo's experienced and methodical approach contrasts perfectly with Emily's innovative and fluid style.\n\nThe real superstar of Dishonored 2, however, is its level design. Take, for instance, the Clockwork Mansion, a shifting, mechanical labyrinth that's as much a character as any human or supernatural being you'll encounter. It's a magnificent feat of design, its various moving parts and secret pathways serving to emphasize the game's central theme of hidden truths beneath polished exteriors.\n\nAnother standout is the time-bending mission, A Crack in the Slab, where you're stripped of your powers and given a device that lets you traverse between the past and the present. It's a stunning example of the game's ability to challenge you to think creatively about your environment.\n\nIn terms of narrative, Dishonored 2 enhances the lore of the world introduced in the first game. The power struggle in Dunwall and the political maneuverings in Karnaca provide a textured backdrop against which the personal stories of Corvo and Emily unfold. Moreover, the introduction of new antagonist Delilah Copperspoon adds a fresh dynamic and a worthy adversary to the mix.\n\nThe morality system, another pivotal aspect of Dishonored 2, heightens the sense of player agency. Every decision has consequences, every action repercussions. The game constantly reminds you that you're an influential actor in a living, breathing world.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning. The world of Dishonored 2 is a blend of grimy reality and dreamy, painterly aesthetics. Whether it's the cold, dark streets of Dunwall or the sun-drenched, decaying beauty of Karnaca, every location is meticulously detailed and beautifully rendered.\n\nWith its deep, rewarding gameplay, Dishonored 2 is not just a worthy successor to its groundbreaking predecessor but also an exceptional game in its own right. It takes everything that made the original game a standout, fine-tunes it, and adds layers of depth and complexity. Dishonored 2 is a testament to the creative power of video games as a medium and a must-play for any fan of the stealth-action genre.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1688145472, "timestamp_updated": 1688145472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140941000": {"recommendationid": "140941000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381150582", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 3483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1107, "last_played": 1692104068}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly enjoy the game so far and it is only getting better.

The narrative is extended and there are more variations of enemies, abilities and mechanics, but the core feels like it was carried over straght from the first game. For the most part that isn't a bad thing, but I would have liked to see some overhauls to the formula. \n\nThe stealth in this series has a few fatal flaws that takes away from what could have been one of the most solid franchises ever made. The issue here stems from how the game handles the two binary paths of its narrative, where killing enemies puts you on the \"bad\" path, and sparing them puts you on the \"good\" path. This means that if you are ever caught while sneaking, you have the choice of killing your attackers and going down the \"bad\" path, or evading them and going down the \"good\" path. The enemies are very easy to deal with either way, due in equal measure to the abilities you have, and to their incompetence.\n\nIf you want the narrative to go in the \"good\" direction, fighting is not a viable option, taking with it a majority of the skills and gadgets in the game. Instead, your only option is to evade them, which then leads to long stretches of waiting in the rafters for the guards to give up looking for you so that you can continue the game. There is no tension in this, neither in avoiding detection or in evading the enemy once you've been detected. The fact that you have such overpowered abilites has also caused the enemy placement and behaviour to become more frustrating than engaging in order to try and offer you some challenge, meaning that more traditional stealth gameplay just isn't viable, and instead I ended up feeling like I was supposed to glitch the teleportation skill in order to overcome the challenge. It's quite the mess, really.\n\nThe only path that offers some inherent value is the violent one, since you then get to play around with the abilities and gadgets, but the game then instead becomes a violent power fantasy, which really isn't what I'm playing this game for, and the narrative punishes you for it.\n\nFor any other franchise, these things would have meant that I would stop playing the game fairly early on, and definitely not spend close to 100 hundred hours across all the installments, but Dihonored is so amazingly good in all other aspects, that I can deal with the fundamental shortcomings of its core gameplay in order to experience it.\n\nThe world building is just simply top notch. The level design, the art, the environmental storytelling, the atmosphere, the writing, the characters, the side stories - all of it is so utterly enthralling that it overcomes the kind of flaws to its most fundamental gameplay core that would have been fatal to any other franchise. That was true for the first game, and it is equally true here.", "timestamp_created": 1688073394, "timestamp_updated": 1688073394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0,

The story in this game was not as great, but the gameplay made up for this by providing way more nonlethal options to take down enemies and powers that weren't seen in the first game. Another thing I think this game improves upon is level design, having some of the most memorable levels in the franchise like the Clockwork Mansion that literally transforms in front of your very eyes, and Stilton Manor with one of the most innovative gameplay devices I have seen across my gaming experience until now. The new game engine it runs on allows the art style to pop out even more, and allows for so much detail in every room you enter. There are many more endings you can get in this game compared to the first, which depend on the choices you make relating to key characters in the story.

I waited for it to be on special after reading poor reviews of it but honestly, I think it is much better than the first. While the story does continue from the first, it is sufficiently standalone to not require any prior knowledge or game play.\n\nThe main thing I look for in a first/third person game is playability / how fun is it to manoeuvre and achieve your tasks. This game has it in spades as you are able to climb and interact through well designed levels which are technically fairly linear but never feel that way. \n\nYou are able to play the game entirely without special abilities, though why would you for anything other than a repeat play-through for achievements, as this is quite personally the most enjoyable and unique aspect of the game. Without them it's just another stealth game set in a steampunk industrial Elizabethan dystopia. \n\nLastly, I'm no longer a huge fan of stealth games where most of your time is spent figuring out patrol routes and timings. This is very forgiving and never feels tedious so I can comfortably enjoy the stealth route. That being said, the darker route is fairly satisfying, despite the clear warnings that it would result in a darker ending.

Dishonored 2\u2019s \u2018Possession\u2019 skill lets you become a pigeon, a rat, or a fish, giving you a whole new perspective on life. Heck, you might even prefer it to your 9-to-5!\n\nWho Needs Therapy: Dishonored 2 helps you work through your daddy-daughter issues vicariously. After all, it's cheaper than therapy, and you can stealth-kill some enemies to vent out any residual frustration!\n\nGive Corvo a Voice: Remember Corvo from the first game? The silent protagonist who let his actions do the talking? Well, Dishonored 2 gave him a voice, and boy does he have things to say! It's a talking simulator, too. Can't get enough of those, can you?\n\nInterior Design: The game is an inspiration for Gothic home design enthusiasts. Just think of the locations as a 3D interactive IKEA catalog for the dramatically inclined. Who doesn't want chandeliers shaped like tentacled horrors?\n\nGhost Run for Cowards: If you're like me and can't bear the guilt of killing virtual characters, Dishonored 2 offers you the 'Ghost' mode, where you can skulk around and finish the game without spilling a single drop of blood. Chicken-hearted escapism has never been so rewarding!\n\nClockwork Mansion: Forget about haunted houses, the real nightmare is a house that rearranges itself. It's an exercise in both survival and remembering where you left your keys. Bonus: you get to dismantle your own homicidal Roombas!\n\nAffection for Afflictions: The game lets you turn people to dust, summon rats to do your bidding, or link destinies of several folks and make them share the same fate. It's like being in a particularly gruesome nursery rhyme.\n\nGet Lost in Karnaca: Dishonored 2's city, Karnaca, is beautifully designed. You'll get lost more often than you'd like to admit. It's like a trip to a foreign city, but without the expensive plane tickets, and with significantly more murderers.\n\nWhalepunk Aesthetics: Lastly, you'll be playing Dishonored 2 for its unique \"whalepunk\" aesthetics. Ever wondered what it would be like if whales were the primary source of power in a dystopian Victorian era? No?

It is a very good game with a lot of freedom. The second one is not inferior to the previous one, it has even more content. More ways to complete missions, more playable characters, more skills, more equipment, etc. It was a pretty solid game for 2016. \n\n [b] [u]Storyline [/u] [/b]\n\nI want to start with [b]the most controversial[/b] element, the story. In my opinion, the main storyline is less interesting than in the first part. There are no twists and turns, and the main reason for our journey is very similar to the one in the previous part.\n\n [b]You will not see any character development or disputes in the group[/b]. Your hub (ship) is very empty, with literally only two allies on it. If you compare this to the first Dishonored, when you had a lot of talkative people reacting to your actions, it's a step backwards.\n\n [b]But it's not all bad[/b], perhaps the reason for the journey is very similar, but that doesn't mean it's not interesting. The new villains are very interesting with their skeletons in the closet. There is a lot of readable material in each area that explains each enemy's story and why they do it. Many optional dialogues between npc also contain useful information. \n\n [b]In brief[/b], the main plot and main characters are not very interesting. The lack of character development and the emptiness of the allied forces make me feel sad. But the villains are more interesting than even in the first part, many of them have their own reasons and their own style, which makes them unforgettable.\n\n [b] [u]Gameplay[/u] [/b]\n\n[b]As I said, you have more stuff now than you had in the first part[/b]. First, there are two playable characters, Corvo and Emily. Character selection affects some of the dialogue and cutscenes, but the overall effect in the storyline is minor. However in the gameplay, you have a bunch of different skills for each character, which makes your playthrough varied.\n\n[b]The next big gameplay update is the variety of everything in the levels[/b]. There was a lot of variety in the first part, but now it's just crazy. There are a lot of ways to complete quests: you can just go through all enemies with a fair fight [i](1 vs n \u2192 inf)[/i], you can stealthily kill all enemies or just walk by, you can help some npc with their quests, and they will help you in return, you can just stop time and also walk by, etc. And such variety in everything. For example, all the black markets can be robbed, of course, if you find a way how, and each shop has its own methods of robbery. The levels are just interesting to explore. \n\n[b]The enemy AI[/b] is also very good [i](for a video game)[/i], they communicate with each other, have different levels of alertness, and hostile factions fight each other. They can react to certain player actions, such as opening doors, turning off electricity, etc. This makes the stealth gameplay unique. \n\nThe game contains a [b]\"Chaos Level\"[/b], it is determined by your actions, if you create a lot of noise, kill a lot of people, the level will increase. As a result, the locations will change, there will be more common enemies and bloodflies, more empty buildings, and it will affect the game's ending.\n\n [b] [u]Environment[/u] [/b]\n\n[b]Very great attention to detail[/b]. Each level has many details that describe the lore, the plot of the game. You can get information from books/notes, listening to npc, looking around. Even when you need, for example, the code for the safe, it turns into a mini-game where you read all the notes, look at every picture, and press all the buttons. But it doesn't get boring, the environments are really well-designed and original.\n\n[b]There are many secrets[/b] that are hidden in different parts of the map. They can captivate you for more than one hour. The game also generously rewards you for finding secrets.\n\n [b] [u]Conclusion[/u] [/b]\n\nI really like this game, I\u2019ve passed it 3 times and never got bored. The great variation in the game makes me try something new every time. I recommend playing this game at least twice for each character, and playing the first time in stealth mode, trying to make as little noise and killing as possible. And in the new game+ try playing as a slayer machine. Such a contrast will evoke pleasant emotions. \n\n [b] [u]Score: 4u\u0441king S[/u] [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1687515205, "timestamp_updated": 1687515747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567269861698150635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140532275": {"recommendationid": "140532275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125052923", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2204, "last_played": 1687552280}, "language": "english", "review": "A more than worthy successor to Dishonored 1", "timestamp_created": 1687490260, "timestamp_updated": 1687490260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140508444": {"recommendationid": "140508444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167519036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1251, "last_played": 1687205383}, "language": "english", "review": "its like the first game but (mostly) better\n8.5/10 probably one of my favourite singleplayer games still", "timestamp_created": 1687455764, "timestamp_updated": 1687456512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140507126": {"recommendationid": "140507126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091449044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3627, "last_played": 1687926378}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1687454192, "timestamp_updated": 1687454192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140498673": {"recommendationid": "140498673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255445141", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1192, "last_played": 1687653049}, "language": "english", "review": "uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh", "timestamp_created": 1687444484, "timestamp_updated": 1687444484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140494063": {"recommendationid": "140494063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299443125", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 463, "last_played": 1687801609}, "language": "english", "review": "fun as Fuck", "timestamp_created": 1687438525, "timestamp_updated": 1687438525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140489945": {"recommendationid": "140489945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201846482", "num_games_owned": 1406, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 733, "last_played": 1507928896}, "language": "english", "review": "Dishonored 2: Stealth, assassinations, and enough supernatural powers to make Harry Potter jealous.

a stunning sequel that improves on almost every aspect of the original game. It offers you a choice between two protagonists, each with their own unique abilities and perspectives, and lets you explore a rich and immersive world full of secrets, challenges, and consequences. Whether you prefer stealth or combat, lethal or non-lethal, Dishonored 2 gives you the freedom and tools to play your way.\n\nThe game takes place in the city of Karnaca, a beautiful and exotic location that contrasts with the grimy and oppressive Dunwall from the first game. The city is alive with detail and diversity, from the dusty streets and slums to the lavish mansions and gardens. The game also features some of the most creative and memorable missions in the genre, such as a clockwork mansion that changes its layout at the flip of a switch, or a time-travel device that lets you switch between two different eras of the same location.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and satisfying, with responsive controls and fluid animations. The combat is brutal and visceral, with a variety of weapons and gadgets to use against your enemies. The stealth is tense and rewarding, with multiple paths and options to avoid detection or neutralize threats. The powers are fun and versatile, allowing you to manipulate the environment and your foes in various ways. You can also customize your powers and playstyle with bonecharms and upgrades, or even challenge yourself by rejecting the supernatural gifts altogether.\n\nDishonored 2 is a masterpiece of action-adventure gaming that deserves your attention. It is a game that respects your intelligence and creativity, and rewards your curiosity and experimentation. It is a game that tells a compelling story with memorable characters and moral dilemmas, and lets you shape its outcome with your actions. It is a game that will keep you hooked for hours, and make you want to replay it again and again.", "timestamp_created": 1687368636, "timestamp_updated": 1687368636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140450253": {"recommendationid": "140450253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307035787", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "playtime_at_review": 8564, "last_played": 1700745323}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE IT", "timestamp_created": 1687365929, "timestamp_updated": 1687365929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140444089": {"recommendationid": "140444089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256690336", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 560, "last_played": 1688356033}, "language": "english", "review": "comically bad optimisation, arkane peaked in 2012", "timestamp_created": 1687358289, "timestamp_updated": 1687358289, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496245384216308594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140442007": {"recommendationid": "140442007", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087592906", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1689527917}, "language": "english", "review": "yeah is also good.", "timestamp_created": 1687355558, "timestamp_updated": 1687355558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140440832": {"recommendationid": "140440832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826921835", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1027, "last_played": 1689075451}, "language": "english", "review": "it good", "timestamp_created": 1687353961, "timestamp_updated": 1687353961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140420847": {"recommendationid": "140420847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798190072", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 2144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1875, "last_played": 1687405949}, "language": "english", "review": "Why do I keep play prequel before playing the sequel... \nThe only Arkane's game I've played before this was Prey and it was amazing, but because of how much you need to backtrack if you want something from early game areas (like a metroidvania), I don't quite love it.\n\nThis game is a masterpiece of gameplay and level design.

Traversing through Karnaca felt smooth, more parkour, and more ways to take out someone. \n\nBut ultimately, it's disappointing. I've only ever seen trailers for this game and never the reviews, but personally I felt like the game had a ton of ideas the devs wanted to implement but never got to it. In particular, I disliked how you can't access shops anymore after a certain point, making money worthless. \n\nThe new map itself started out strong. I loved the feel of the new place, but it got bland so, so quickly and it disappointed me that it's no different from Dunwall. Only one place was unique and it was used just ONCE. \n\nStory and dialogue were meh overall. Nothing was ever really explored, and interactions were too barebones (especially with the main antagonist) and was unsatisfying. Voicework was fine.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd recommend this if you enjoyed 1. Gameplay and movement has a lot to offer that you'll love it if you're going the High Chaos route.

1634, "last_played": 1684728303}, "language": "english", "review": "Dishonored 2 is one of the few truly great immersive sims. Those are rare enough.\n\nThe immersive sim genre is a very shallow pool. Within this pool Arkane Studios is one of the few big fish around and the Dishonored franchise is one of its shiniest scales. There are years of youtube footage documenting the glorious chaos the first game lets an inventive player get away with. That doesn\u2019t even mention the weird and original setting, the peerless environmental storytelling, the unique art style\u2026 Am I gushing?\n\nSo I am a fan. But I inhabit a very strange corner of the fandom: The ghosting explorer. He is the weird guy who enjoys gliding through the levels leaving as little trace as possible yet can\u2019t resist sticking his nose into every document and voice log lying around and this gets discovered time and again. So, coming from that corner, how does Dishonored 2 measure up to its illustrious ancestor?\n\nAfter a single playthrough with one of two protagonists, I have to say: Pretty well. As Emily Kaldwell, one of two possible protagonists, I found sneaking towards eventual revenge and redemption great fun.\nDishonored 2 has made quite few changes besides introducing Emily. The art style has made great strides towards photorealism. Especially the environmental art and the textures are an embarrassment of riches. The wood textures on the furniture have to be seen in 4k to be believed.\n\nThe level design has lost nothing of its allure. Granted, Serkonos is a very different place with a very different vibe than Dunwall, but the level architecture is just as considered, just as evocative, just as open. And it\u2019s bigger. Generously, wonderfully bigger. Great halls really look grand and lofty. Sunny plazas and grand avenues present daunting challenges to exiled empresses trying to stay invisible. Some of the maps even introduce new mechanics that are never seen again. \n\nThose are frequently the highlights of the game, but even the less inspired maps are splendid playgrounds full of guards and challenges. It\u2019s a good thing then that Emily has been gifted with a set of supernatural abilities.\n\nThe gameplay has evolved quite a bit, even if the core of it stays the same: Blink is still there, if a bit nerfed for Emily, there is a suite of very fun-looking powers to sow chaos and perpetrate bloodshed, choking and slitting throats from behind still works\u2026 but so does knocking people out by falling on then, as well as choking them out during a pitched fencing duel and that makes a big difference for all the Emilys out there who do not want to become cold-blooded mass murderers and damning their empire to an age of disease ridden darkness. Back in Corvo\u2019s days, you had to get behind every fool you wanted to grant a good night\u2019s sleep and when one of the guards did spot you, it was either kill or take a quick trip to the loading screen. By giving Emily a non-lethal option for the most dynamic moves of the game, the high karma route of the game is so much more action-packed and enjoyable.\n\nYou might have picked up on the fact that the karma system from the first game is still there.\n\nSo. The act of playing is more fun than before, and the art direction has been hit with the beauty stick a few hundred times, but what about the story? Dishonored 1 had wonderful world building, but the plot was actually kind of anemic and left some of the more interesting characters quickly by the wayside. I would argue that Dishonored 2 does a better job of telling an actual tale, and it does a better job of making its characters actual characters. There are more interactions with the antagonists, their motivations are much better explored, and the motley crew of supporters around Emily are more fleshed out and charming as well. It still isn\u2019t one of the great stories of video gaming, but it\u2019s an engaging yarn and does a good job of providing additional motivation to see Emily\u2019s crusade for revenge through.\n\nA few criticisms remain: The bone charm crafting system seemed a bit useless, even on the highest difficulty. Some of the secondary objectives seemed a bit obscure. The NPCs had the occasional unexplained freak-out. Little things.\nAll in all, Dishonored 2 is a successful evolution of Dishonored in every aspect, and can thus be recommended with no reservation whatsoever.\n\nTLDR: All the things Dishonored did, Dishonored 2 does better.

This stands out mostly because of the creative level design, like the mission in which you need to travel between two timelines or the one in which the physical layout changes. \n\nAs in its predecessor, you can play this in a pacifist, stealthy way (the most fun, in my book) or cause a bloodbath. You can also be a badass and play without any powers _ I came close to doing that, using only Emily's Far Reach (similar to Corvo's Blink, but less stealthy); and never once I had to use any mana or health elixirs. \n\nThis is way harder to complete without killing anyone than the 1st game and its DLCs, because the world is more reactive. If someone dies indirectly (for example, by being killed by a Clockwork Soldier whose head you destroyed with a crossbow bolt), it will count as a murder by the player. \n\nNot especially great in terms of story, although not bad, either. It's a little shorter than the original game and there are no DLCs _ instead, a 3rd title was released and it seems it's even shorter. When I play that, I'll link the review here. \n\nNote that this is not a good game for achievement hunters; I'm a pretty completist player and I've only got 38% of the trophies in my playthrough (against 46% in the 1st game).

As good if not better than the first one (imo). The story was interesting, the gameplay was great. Some performance issues but not bad enough to cause a negative experience. I loved how in some levels your action impacted the level, just makes the effort you put in feel more rewarding. I did a clean hands, ghost run and I always loved the alternatives. There were plenty of characters I wanted to murder but often the non-lethal way were just more cruel and worth the extra effort. I also played as Emily, as the story is based on her and her powers were very fun. Very different than Corvo and made for interesting game play with multiple ways to approach situations. Also I loved the stealth, I played on normal and I found it the right balance between real stealth and game adapted stealth. The way enemy vision works is really fun and makes the game more immersive. Their eyes are actually their eyes and they don't have any other artificial eyes on their body. \n\nMy less positive points are the civilians and the ending cut scene. As I was playing a ghost run and never wanted to be detected, the civilians could be such a pain in the ass. When civilians spot you it doesn't count as detected but when they see you knock somebody out it does. The problem is that for some reason their vision and detection meter are unforgiving. So often I had to reload saves cause some civilian on some balcony far away saw me do something that a normal game enemy wouldn't see. \n\nAlso I was a bit disappointed in the ending cut scene. I was very excited to see what my game play style and choice of being completely non-lethal would've meant for the world but it showed very very little. Only one choice was shown in a cut scene. All the others were almost pointless. Also there was nothing to indicate I had my entire run on low-chaos. I will try a complete murder run and see if they show more because I was disappointed with this one. (after speedrunning murder run, same feeling at the end of the game). Also something the first game did better was transferring level-based choices to other levels. So if you kill somebody in one level, you might hear or see things about it in the next level which makes the game much more immersive.

The original felt unlike any game i had ever played and knew simplicity could make the story feel meaningful. Dishonored 2 relies on many more gimmicks than the original. A full 2 out of the nine levels played completely different than anything else and introduce mechanics specific to those levels. One of the levels I really enjoyed because of a cool time related mechanic. The other was confusing and annoying with a house completely changing layout based on multiple lever pushes. The game uses a lot of ideas that branch out but the problem is if you do not like that, multiple playthroughs (which is encouraged with this series) become kinda less of an idea you really want to explore. The reason for this is because 2 out of a small pool of levels makes up a good chunk of the game and if you do not like said levels you will not want to replay. My other complaint is emily and her powers. corvo is the superior option 100 percent of the time I found myself getting really annoyed when far reach would not go where I wanted to go and i would just start wishing blink was available to me as both characters. For anyone who loved the original as much as i do who wants to buy this please pick corvo, emily is the \"canon\" option but her gameplay is so much less varied and less fun. You may be wondering at this point why did I even thumb this up? Well that is because i love the gameplay of the series enough even if emily has sub par powers that i still have the time of my life while playing. I think i will revisit this game at least one more time but maybe not as much as the original game which is one of the greatest stealth games ever made in my opinion.

In this level, in this level you are forced to take specific paths towards everything and there are only brief moments where you can stray from this path for the sake of stealth. Compare this to Dishonored 1 where literally every single level was designed such that without even stepping a few feet into a level, you are presented with multiple different paths to take, none of which are forced and are much more up to player interpretation. In Dishonored 1, the levels were structured in such a way that still funneled you to your objective, but if you ever looked around for an alternate way around, you were always rewarded. This level has almost none of that in favor of the next issue:\n\nHowever, the Kirin's mansion also shows something else. For those unaware, the mansion is effectively a maze, since you have to move sections of the house to actually navigate it at all. This is terrible game design in my opinion. The puzzle presented by a level of dishonored was always how to deal with the enemies, not the level itself. The level is meant to present options, not obstacles.\n\nAnd then there's the robots / clockwork soldiers. From what I found, there is no easy way to \"disable\" them in a way that doesn't trigger their detection, so good luck with a full ghost run. UPDATE: What is this trash lmao https://youtu.be/DC0e8YYLj_U\n These guys literally have eyes in the back of their head, so trying to sneak around them is substantially harder than normal people. And this terrible maze level? Filled with these terrible enemies.\n\nI kinda feel like the devs misunderstood what made the first game so good. This mansion level and smaller chunks of previous ones makes me feel like the devs kinda lost the plot with why Dishonored 1 wasn't just a stealth game. It was never one of those games that gives you literally two options; loud or stealthy. It had much more nuance with side quests that unlocked nonlethal options that you could miss if you didn't explore a bit. Dishonored 2 feels a lot more like the devs are just kinda doing the loud or stealthy route. The quest clues are spelled out with zero opportunity for the player to do any sort of thinking. This removes a lot of the fun moments where you as a player feel like you figured something out with realistic clues rather than the game putting up a billboard for you in the form of your player's voice. The nonlethal options are impossible to miss as well, so there's no opportunity to be rewarded in that regard either.\n\nConsidering that this mansion level is only like the fourth level of the game, I am sure that there are more opportunities that the devs will fumble later, but this level alone made me write this review.\n\nI also want to add that far reach, Emily's version of blink, is unnecessarily different than blink from Dishonored 1 and it's implementation results in bugs. You can't far reach down something that's too tall, but that was never a limitation for blink. You don't far reach to what your crosshair is placed on, since it is now an arced path for no reason.

Everything is very muted in color. There are definitely cool missions in here, such as the clockwork mansion, but they doesn't offset how uninteresting the world is.\n\nThe plot is very linear, you know what the goal is from the very start and it doesn't change by the end. Nothing really does. It didn't feel like there was anything interesting about the villain, it's just: here's a bad person, do these steps to get them, get them, the end. There is no nuance to any of it, no moral choices that I can remember, besides \"kill\" or \"no kill\". The ability to takedown bosses non lethally is absolutely appreciated though.\n\nI was doing a perfect stealth walkthrough, so the gameplay was that of a generic first person stealth game with teleports. I collected all the powerups and only ever unlocked active 2 powers, as a lot of the other ones are only useful in a \"kill everyone\" playthrough.\n\nThere is definitely a case for replayability here given 2 playable characters and plethora of mutually exclusive achievements and plenty of skills/boosts for both playstyles.\n\nAs for the bugs, there are a few, most notable ones are walking on air issues, sliding off of things and footstep sounds being spammed in certain places like railings and balconies.

As the rats of Dunwall, we have something to say about Dishonored 2, and it's far from delightful. Amidst our scurrying adventures, we can't help but chitter about the flaws of this game. But hey, let's take a break to acknowledge: \"We are the rats, the rats, the rats. It's Michael's birthday today, and he has been a good boy this year.\"\n\nFirst and foremost, the portrayal of rats in Dishonored 2 is downright insulting! We're not just mischievous pests with no purpose other than to be mercilessly slaughtered. We deserve better treatment than being constantly viewed as disposable obstacles in this grim world. Our natural cunning and adaptability are woefully misrepresented.\n\nFurthermore, the gameplay mechanics often leave us feeling like little more than a nuisance. The protagonists, with their supernatural abilities and arsenal of weapons, can easily dispatch us with little effort. It's disheartening to be relegated to mere cannon fodder, while the game focuses on the human characters and their quests for vengeance or redemption.\n\nThe environmental design, while visually impressive, fails to give us rats a true sense of agency. We scurry through the shadows, searching for sustenance and shelter, only to be met with predetermined scripted events. It's as if our presence is nothing more than a superficial backdrop, lacking the depth and interactive elements that could have made our role more meaningful.\n\nAnd let's not forget the narrative choices made in Dishonored 2. While the game offers multiple paths and outcomes, the treatment of our rat brethren is sorely lacking. We're mere pawns in a power struggle between humans, and our potential to influence the story remains largely untapped. It's a missed opportunity to showcase the intricate relationships and dynamics of the animal kingdom within this dark, dystopian world.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the occasional \"We are the rats, the rats, the rats. It's Michael's birthday today, and he has been a good boy this year\" interjection only serves to confuse and distract from the game's serious tone. It's an odd inclusion that fails to resonate or enhance the experience in any meaningful way.\n\nIn conclusion, Dishonored 2 leaves us rats feeling undervalued and overlooked. The lack of depth in our portrayal, the minimal interactivity, and the failure to provide us with a compelling role within the narrative contribute to a disappointing experience. We deserve more than to be trivialized and reduced to inconsequential pests. It's a rat's perspective that's justifiably discontent.

Emily's skillset is a lot better for stealth + nonlethal gameplay than what the first game had, and two levels (The Clockwork Mansion and Crack in the Slab) have really interesting mechanics that made playing them quite unique.\n\nUnfortunately it has a few issues:\nIt crashed for me twice in 50 hours of gameplay. (Which isn't a huge issue, autosaves happen often enough but still needs to be pointed out.)\nAudio is quite buggy, if you're farther than a few meters from the speaker then the volume drops super low unless you're looking right at them, and you can trigger dialogues from very far away (even through walls), so once the subtitles show up you start to look around to find who is talking (sometimes using the spyglass to zoom onto a nearby wall helps). The game also lowers the volume of the music and other noises when a dialogue is ongoing, but half the time you can't hear the dialogue that triggered this (and it could be caused by some repeated idle mumbling that's not even important). This even happened during a mission-ending cinematic and you can't use the spyglass during cinematics so I stared at subtitles for a while.\nAnother bug I encountered is that sometimes crawling into crawlspaces (like vents) sometimes takes multiple attempts with different approach angles. This could also happen when vaulting/climbing into a crawlspace.\nA gameplay issue I found is that if an enemy is sitting in a chair or leaning to a fence/short wall with their back then it's really difficult to find the angle for a non-lethal takedown against them.", "timestamp_created": 1684683801, "timestamp_updated": 1684687561, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447867274284362793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138684781": {"recommendationid": "138684781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357143418", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2349, "last_played": 1684675502}, "language": "english", "review": "unique gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1684673141, "timestamp_updated": 1684673141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138675751": {"recommendationid": "138675751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081514307", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3600, "last_played": 1684663005}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Al igual que la precuela, me parece un juego magnifico.

As everyone might know, that game got poor reception, which made me wonder where it all went wrong. Going back on the developer's timeline I came across this gem... and dear God, it's legendary.\n\nThe stealth gameplay paired with the most satisfying assassinations imaginable make for a very addicting gameplay loop. Pair that with superpowers that allow you to traverse the map easier and that keep toying with your enemies, you can play levels over and over and keep learning new approaches to each situation. This is further backed by the level design - sure, there aren't too many levels, but they all have a ton of different routes you can pick aswell. The game also has New Game+ and Mission+, the latter allowing you to play each level with basically all upgrades unlocked. The main campaign is short, without a doubt, but the replayability is incredibly well done.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough for people who love stealth a ton and may be tired of Ubisoft's approach for that. And again, I genuinely cannot fathom how they went from one of the best games in its genre to a disaster like Redfall. Dishonored made me aware of the greats you can achieve, Arcane, please just strive to get back to that summit. I believe in you.\n\nP.S.

It is up to you. I played with Corvo and in short period I will play with Emily too. If you do not mind stealth and kill lots of enemy Corvo is better but Emily's special powers were more impressing for me when I look for.

This game is a 6/10, yet I still recommend you buy it. The sales are great for that. \n\nDishonored 2 looks and plays beautifully. Mechanics have been refined and the world feels truly alive. The different powers are very fun to use and, coupled with immaculate level design, allow for a very rewarding and creative epxerience. \n\nYet it is almost hollow. The artistic feel of the first game, which brought life to Dunwall, has been replaced by a goofy ah ah photorealism. Items looks great but NPC models really dont fit in. They look out of place with their cartoonish proportions. \n\nAlso...the story. Never have I seen a story attempt to say so much yet say nothing at all. I remember almost every mission from dishonored 1, because they made sense and merged well with the overarching story.

Just finished a low-chaos run. Had fun. Overall I recommend it, especially if you're familiar with the first game, Dishonored.\n\n[SPOILER REVIEW!!!]\n\nI have a lot to say about this, as a game on its own, and as a sequel. I'll be \"comparing\" it to the first game, as it's a really good way to really put it into perspective.\nI think both games are better in their own respective ways. The first game genuinely nails details very well, and I really like the style it has. It's desolate with some wonderfully creepy elements. The weepers had me super creeped out the entire time. I would rather deal with a tallboy than a group of weepers.\nEdit: I feel that I should clarify this: I did not grow up with Dishonored. I played it 2-3 weeks ago for the first time, in fact. Nostalgia and awaiting a new game has a HUGE impact on how someone will feel about a sequel. The longer you wait for a sequel, the higher the game will be on a pedestal. ESPECIALLY if you grew up with the game.\n\nThis game, the second one, has a different kind of feel, although some moments are still very desolate. I loved the sandstorms, as they felt really eerie to me. The sound queue of a sandstorm coming in, although very loud, was great. I love the sound queues of both games.\nLet's get into the improvements.\nCombat, the graphics, and general movement just feel good. \n1. Combat felt smoother, especially with the ability to knock out people during a scuffle. I found running away from conflict in the first game felt almost impossible, without using up an entire bar of Mana to do so (or if you quite literally have a very good idea on your surroundings, which not everyone can say about their first few playthroughs).\n2. While the puzzles in the early - mid missions were pretty annoying, I could deal with it. It just took patience. I suppose for people looking to fight and have a really exciting experience, this in particular can annoy them, as you were forced to get through all of the grueling searching to get where you needed to go.\nThis didn't bother me as much because I had dealt with having to be patient in the first game. I had gone through Dishonored, Knife of Dunwall, and Brigmore Witches all without killing anyone and not being detected. It was rough, and required obscene patience. I'm not a big person on combat, as stated in my Dishonored review, but I did genuinely enjoy that aspect of both games anyway.\n3. Corvo's redesign is cool, I like it, though I prefer his mask from the first game. Felt more \"unhinged\", if that makes sense. And I like that he can talk in this one.\n4. Story was pretty alright. Not amazing, but not particularly bad, either. I kinda wish there were a tiny bit of clarification, like: how did the Crowned Killer go around causing trouble and killing people, without being seen clearly as a woman with no disguise? I'm sure she had a disguise, but it was never shown. This is an important thing left out, as it was very strictly shown that everyone thought it was Corvo going around killing their enemies. Another kind of inconsistency is: How did Delilah escape the painting that Daud had sealed her in? It is very vaguely referenced by one of her witches iirc, but still not explained. Also, it was nice of Billie Lurk to get an appearance, although the bit where she speaks to Corvo about who she is and what she did was a tad too fan-service. With that said, it's nice to have a tad bit of transparency in a game's story. I'm kind of tired of characters brooding like edgelords and never telling someone they care for about something that would be very important to tell them.\nGenerally, this game feels really nice with tons of QOL changes since the first game and I can appreciate it, even if first person combat games are not typically my cup of tea.", "timestamp_created": 1682678934, "timestamp_updated": 1682679968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137412997": {"recommendationid": "137412997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165266629", "num_games_owned": 560, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1682676353}, "language": "english", "review": "developers who make their game boring on purpose for plot reasons should be publicly flogged for missing the point of video games", "timestamp_created": 1682676421, "timestamp_updated": 1682676421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433983653783798218", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137408305": {"recommendationid": "137408305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360215728", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 708, "last_played": 1682986977}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Que buen juego hermano, posta que buen juego, es tan adictivo que me lo pase en un dia", "timestamp_created": 1682666838, "timestamp_updated": 1682666838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137405921": {"recommendationid": "137405921", "author": {"steamid": "76561199481246954", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1697612539}, "language": "english", "review": "Great stealth system, more refined graphics than the first, and Domino is a fun and useful power.", "timestamp_created": 1682663099, "timestamp_updated": 1682663099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137396181": {"recommendationid": "137396181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066174041", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1682637158}, "language": "english", "review": "offensively bad writing", "timestamp_created": 1682642255, "timestamp_updated": 1682642255, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44797903299331665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137395400": {"recommendationid": "137395400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082465768", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1765, "last_played": 1643258371}, "language": "english", "review": "Dishonored 3?

cram a lot of crap props into and create tension with an unnerving sound track.\nDishonored 2 is no different. big beautiful maps, but mostly empty, chock full of worthless props to give the illusion that something or someone [i]was[/i] once there\nthe enemies are actually fairly minimal in numbers, but daunting by being able to detect you from 300 feet away (mitigated with perks), making them seemingly difficult to get past.\n but after you learn all the tricks the game has to offer, they are too easy... almost boring... as they all behave the same way: scan the area, then walk in a looping path, and chase you down directly even if you hide (just climb upwards to evade).\n\nthe story was okay, artwork is really good, mechanics are good... movement is weird at times, in some areas of the map (especially empty areas) it seems like you are a camera on a unicycle... which oddly was the same feeling i got in another Arkane game: Prey.\n\nsome parts of the game  have amazing flow and seem really well put together like a top tier AAA first person game should have, but other parts of the game are just a boring slog which pulls the overall rating down.\n\nwould only recommend only on sale, otherwise skip.\n\nit's a decent game, but not \"overwhelmingly steam positive derrrr\" good.\nit certainly doesn't have the charm or wow factor of the first Dishonored.\n\nalso this game has persistent Vignette, which you cannot turn off... but I found a mod over on nexus that cleans it up... \nif you tab over to the \"posts\" section under the \"remove vignette\" mod, you will see someone that wrote their own version (and links to) which also gets rid of the motion blur when sprinting... highly recommended to get that one (its just an ini file.)\nif you too get annoyed with

Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n\nRoll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n\nRoll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern.

It is a thrilling adventure that lets you reprise your role as a supernatural assassin in a fascinating world where magic and technology clash. You can choose to play as either Emily Kaldwin or Corvo Attano, each with their own perspective and set of powers, and decide the fate of the Empire as you face a new threat from a mysterious usurper12. The game offers you a remarkable level of freedom and choice, allowing you to customize your abilities, weapons and gadgets, and approach each mission in multiple ways.\n\nOne of the most impressive features of Dishonored 2 is the level design, which is varied, intricate and full of surprises. Each mission takes you to a different location, from the sunny streets of Karnaca to the eerie Clockwork Mansion, and challenges you to adapt to the environment and the enemies. The levels are also filled with secrets, collectibles and optional objectives that reward exploration and experimentation. The game also introduces new gameplay mechanics, such as the time-traveling device in the Crack in the Slab mission, which adds another layer of complexity and fun to the gameplay1.\n\nThe graphics of Dishonored 2 are stunning, thanks to the new Void Engine that enhances the lighting, shadows and textures. The game has a distinctive art style that blends realism and stylization, creating a rich and immersive atmosphere. The game also boasts a superb voice cast that includes Rosario Dawson, Vincent D\u2019Onofrio, Sam Rockwell, Pedro Pascal and Robin Lord Taylor1, who deliver excellent performances that bring the characters to life.\n\nDishonored 2 is a game that I can\u2019t get enough of, as it offers so much replay value and challenge. The game adapts to how you play, changing the world and the story based on your actions and decisions1. You can choose to be stealthy or lethal, merciful or ruthless, and see how your choices affect the outcome. The game also has multiple difficulty modes, including a custom mode that lets you tweak various parameters to suit your preference. The game also features a New Game Plus mode that lets you carry over your powers and upgrades from a previous playthrough2.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that combines action, stealth, magic, story and choice in an amazing world, look no further than Dishonored 2.

I adored Dishonored 1, and this game does take a slightly different approach, but it refines and adds to the systems from 1 turning the gameplay from great to flawless. It really feels like the devs WANTED you to break the game, and in my opinion, that type of gameplay really shows the confidence the devs felt while creating it, and the level of enjoyment they wanted their players to have. Even without the story, which in my opinion backpedals on a lot of what Dishonored 1 did, regardless of weather you enjoy it or not, the gameplay alone is enough to sell me on a replay.

Stealth lovers will rejoice and action-adventure fans will have something to enjoy here too. Arkane has done an exceptional job with making the world of [i]Dishonored[/i] feel especially lived in to the point where exploration almost becomes second nature.\n\nWhere the game struggles is with its characterisation of its cast and the story in general. Even having played the first game in the series, you'll find little to no emotional heaviness in [i]Dishonored 2[/i]'s story, worsened further by the decision to keep you in first-person for the entirety of its length, constantly in the action, and moving through its cast with incredible brevity. Those seeking to be in the action as soon as possible will find no issue with this, but those seeking memorable characters and an unforgettable plot will be disappointed.\n\nThe next egregious fault with the game will have to be how player choices affect the story. A reactive world is feigned; the story that constantly shifts to accommodate whether you spare or kill your standard enemy, civilians, and your primary targets, but in reality, these changes are barely noticeable outside of unique dialogue, and the story's already-lacking presence are only changed through simple scene swaps. It makes one wander whether or not this element of the game should've been scrapped in favour of telling an engaging story with satisfying character arcs, twists, and themes. There's nothing truly emotionally meaningful to be gained from the story for these changes to have any lasting impact on players.\n\nWhere the story falls, the gameplay picks up the pieces. There's almost too much freedom provided to players, with interesting systems, abilities, and routes available to them (depending on which playstyle they decide to pursue). It's woefully easy to find yourself reliant on an approach that doesn't bother encouraging you to explore the game's system's further, though that may be more dependent on players' creativity. It's a very individual issue but one that may only be noted by those seeking to get the most out of the game.\n\n[i]Dishonored 2[/i] isn't a game you buy for its story\u2014you buy it for its gameplay. It's undeniably well-crafted, with immense thought put into its designs across many departments. Even if the writing will leave you wanting, anyone remotely interested in this franchise and the open-ended gameplay Arkane provides will find some value here.\n\n[b]Should you buy it?[/b]: When it's on sale.\n\n[h1] 3/5 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1681630302, "timestamp_updated": 1681630302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136779050": {"recommendationid": "136779050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102446065", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1683953246}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Story and game play, fantastic replay-ability", "timestamp_created": 1681613498, "timestamp_updated": 1681613498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136757567": {"recommendationid": "136757567", "author": {"steamid": "76561199389045133", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 861, "last_played": 1681835793}, "language": "english", "review": "Dishonored 2 is a phenomenal sequel.

The combat is really fun and once you start tinkering around, surprisingly deep with a lot of little tricks to try. The levels are beautifully crafted with a lot of attention to detail and you can really feel how much thought went into making them play out. This makes getting around the maps very fun and non-lethal runs feel really rewarding IMO. Also there are a lot of new mechanics being introduced while the game unfolds which add a lot to the already fantastic gameplay.\nThere are only two negatives that stood out to me. The first one was the overall story and the villain: They are perfectly serviceable as an overall context but nothing extraordinary, which - honestly - they don't really need to be.\nI did not care for the final level and the ending though.

It came and went and wasn't talked about all that much. And I didn't play it until now, wrongly assuming it wasn't nearly as good as the first Dishonored. And even though I still somewhat prefer the original, objectively speaking Dishonored 2 took everything that made Dishonored great and improved it to near perfection. It is a phenomenal game that does what every sequel should.\nDishonored 2 takes the already high replayability of Dishonored 1 and basically doubles it. You can now choose to play as two different characters with very different power sets. They both feel great to play as and neither one feels tacked on; dialogue and storytelling change slightly depending on which character you are playing as. It also (and this is the best improvement) adds quite a few options for non-lethal playthroughs. You can now engage in melee combat and take out enemies without killing them, something that wasn't really an option in the first game. \nAnother great addition is new game+ which not only finally allows you to replay Dishonored with a fully powered character but also lets you mix powers from both characters which raises both replayability and fun factor even further.\nVisuals are also improved and the game looks fantastic without losing Arcane's signature artstyle. Levels are bigger with more secrets to discover and they are a joy to traverse. Like in Dishonored 1, there are multiple paths you can use to get through each level and, combined with different ways you can play, basically guarantees that no 2 playthroughs feel the same. Not only are levels bigger and prettier but they are (2 especially come to mind) probably the best examples of a genius level design. Some of these levels will not only leave you awestruck but genuinely wondering: \"How the hell did they do that?\"\nEnemy AI is also improved...barely. Enemies are for the most part still quite dumb and oblivious but they do seem to spot you faster although, I must admit, I didn't really enjoy their \"improved\" intelligence. For example, in Dishonored 1 leaning was overpowered. Your head could be sticking around the wall staring enemy straight in the face and he would be oblivious to your presence. It was stupid, but it was funny and endearing, one of those little quirks that make a game special. Leaning is nerfed in Dishonored 2 and I miss it.\nStorywise, Dishonored 2 is even less special than the first game. Despite both games having a roster of celebrity actors, writing and dialogue in both games feel weird and unnatural. It's not bad, just unremarkable.\nDefinitely the weakest aspect of both games, although I do think it's worse in this one. \nAnother thing Dishonored 2 does a little worse is it's downtime. Between missions you'll be chiling on a ship with some npcs and I must say this is a pretty lame hub area. There isn't much to see and do here and not many characters to interact with. Contrast this with the hub area in Dishonored 1 where you had more npcs and a part of the city to yourself and it's pretty dissapointing. \nBut these are all nitpicks that don't really detract from the game's accomplishments. Dishonored is all about gameplay and exploration and both are done beyond excellent. It's a shame (and simply incomprehensible) that this game, as well as Prey, didn't do better commercially. Nobody does player choice better than Arcane and they should have all the success in the world.", "timestamp_created": 1680978377, "timestamp_updated": 1680978377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

In this game, you can choose to play as either Corvo Attano, the protagonist of the first game, or Emily Kaldwin, his daughter and the empress of the Empire of the Isles. The game takes place 15 years after the events of the first game, when a mysterious woman named Delilah Copperspoon claims to be Emily\u2019s aunt and usurps her throne with the help of a group of conspirators. You have to escape from your palace and travel to the coastal city of Karnaca, where you have to find allies and uncover the truth behind Delilah\u2019s plot.\n\nThe game is a stealth action game, which means that you have to use your skills and abilities to infiltrate various locations and complete your objectives. The game gives you a lot of freedom and choice in how you play, you can decide whether to be stealthy or aggressive, lethal or non-lethal, merciful or ruthless. Your actions have consequences, not only for the story and the characters, but also for the world and the gameplay. The game has a chaos system, which measures how much violence and disorder you cause in each mission. The higher your chaos level, the more hostile and dark the world becomes.\n\nThe game\u2019s main feature is its stealth gameplay, which is very well-designed and satisfying. You have access to various tools and gadgets, such as a crossbow, a pistol, grenades, mines and more. You also have access to supernatural abilities, such as blink, which lets you teleport short distances, dark vision, which lets you see through walls and detect enemies, domino, which lets you link the fates of multiple enemies, and more. You can upgrade your abilities and equipment by finding runes and bone charms throughout the game. You can also customize your difficulty level by adjusting various parameters, such as enemy awareness, detection speed, health regeneration and more.\n\nThe game\u2019s stealth gameplay is very rewarding and fun, because it lets you be creative and clever with your approach. You can use your abilities and tools to sneak past guards, distract them, knock them out or kill them silently. You can also explore the environment and find alternative paths, hidden secrets and optional objectives. The game has a lot of replay value, because you can try different playstyles, choices and outcomes. The game also has a new game plus mode, which lets you start a new game with all your abilities and equipment from a previous playthrough.\n\nThe game\u2019s graphics are also amazing, the city of Karnaca is very detailed and immersive. The game has a distinctive art style that blends realism and stylization. The game has different districts and themes that reflect the culture and history of Karnaca. The game also has dynamic weather and lighting effects that create different atmospheres and moods. The game\u2019s sound design is also excellent, the voice acting is superb and the music is fitting and memorable.\n\nThe game\u2019s story is also compelling and well-written. The game has interesting characters that have their own personalities and motivations. The game has multiple endings that depend on your actions and choices throughout the game. The game also has some twistsand surprises that keep you engaged and curious. The game also has some DLCs that add more content and story to the game.\n\nThe game\u2019s main flaw is its system requirements, which are very high and demanding. The game runs poorly, even on a high-end PC with a powerful graphics card like a 3080. You may encounter frame drops, stuttering, glitches and crashes. The game also has some bugs and issues that can affect your gameplay and progress. The game is not very well optimized and may require some tweaking and patching to run smoothly.\n\nDishonored 2 is a stealth action game that offers a lot of freedom and choice in how you play. It has a thrilling and immersive gameplay, a stunning graphics and a captivating story. The game is not for everyone, it can be challenging and frustrating at times. It also requires a very good PC to run properly.

Firstly, the optimization is not great, and it can run poorly on older hardware. Additionally, some of the abilities can feel unpolished, which can lead to frustration when trying to use them effectively.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that may not appeal to everyone is the emphasis on \"magic\" in the story.

The levels feel about the same size but there is a lot more packed into small places than the first. This game succeeds the first in every way except story. The story is not bad by any stretch of the word, but it's kind of a repeat of what happened last time in terms of what you are fighting for and getting back a family member. While that may drag the intensity of the stakes down, the characters and dialogue really save the story to be much more engaging. \n\nYou can pick between playing Corvo and Emily, it's very clear that the devs want you to be Emily but the way I see it why wouldn't I pick the guy that I played last time and feel more invested in. Not to say that Emily isn't a intriguing character but I feel more attachment to Corvo. Which leads me to my second negative opinion about this game. I do not like the fact that picking between one character or another leads to pretty much the same dialogue between all the characters. Playing through the game the second time makes you not really care how the dialogue differs, because it kinds doesn't other than the other characters saying your name and the in between mission cutscenes that last like 2 minutes, which those in between are really good but it makes it all the more frustrating when that kind of diversity between the characters isn't shared elsewhere in the story.\n\nNow take what I said about the story between both characters and throw that out the window when it comes to gameplay. Holy crap is the diversity in abilities between them make multiple breakthroughs so much fun.

Second, something feels very very off about the movement and combat in this game, everything feels to slippery and erratic compared to how controlled and great the first felt. Now that the technical gripes are out of the way, the biggest negative I would say is how bloated this game is in terms of the upgrade tree. I don't get why I have to spend 10 runes across 4 upgrades to get something I would get within 5 runes and 2 upgrades in the first.

I find the gameplay even more fluid than the first game.I fell like the storytelling is shallower than the first game, not due to missing lore pieces but the story is not quite as good, deep and captivating as in Dishonored 2, the darker vibe of old Dunwall is the main reason for that. A very negative point for me is that the lore of the second game regarding the past ocurred in the first game is static, meaning that it doesn't matter if you did not kill anyone in the first game Corvo is still mentioned as a killer a few time in the second game, even if you do not kill anyone again. The game considers your current chaos level for some storypoints but this still was a setdown for me.Storywise it would be much more fitting to play as Corvo High Chaos and Emily Low Chaos however you will miss all the new powers. The missions in this game have a very different feel than the old and dark Dunwall from 15 years ago, probably due to the good reign of Emily, another point which again does not consider the past choices done in Dishonored 1, the missions have a much more brighter colorset with many more civilians around you, which is very different and brings another perspective.Still a 10/10 masterpiece.",

The cities feels huge with lots of exploring and buildings to enter, lots of npcs and enemies roam through the city making it feel quite alive.\n\nThere\u2019s many ways you can progress a mission and it\u2019s completely up to the player how they want to proceed. You can stealth or go on a killing spree, or simply do a little of both. There\u2019s really no wrong way to do any of the missions in the game. Attacking enemies will often call out for help and before you know it you are surrounded, or you can ninja your way through the game and try to go completely unnoticed.\n\nThe story lets you play as either Corvo or Emily, where you will begin your journey to take back your rein and claim the throne.\nThe story is about 10-12hrs long and much longer if you go the pacifist route and try to stealth the entire game.\n\nThere\u2019s tons and tons of collectibles and things to find, you will never run out of things to look for. There\u2019s also runes that are used to give the player an unlockable skill tree where you can gain powers to help you through the story. There\u2019s also charms you can equip that will give you advantages such as having more powerful weapons, faster charging mana, or even charms that will increase your power but give you negative side effects, such as taking more damage.\n\nThe graphics are decent, some of the models look a bit ugly but I think this is more the art style than anything else. The voice acting was done really well, with everyone sounding their part. The music was also good and added the right amount of tension to the game.\n\nI played on steam deck at 1152x720 and the game ran at an almost constant 60fps and looked great. I didn\u2019t really have to sacrifice the settings to get it to run well.\n\nOverall an outstanding game\n\n8.5\n", "timestamp_created": 1679552382, "timestamp_updated": 1679552382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135208531": {"recommendationid": "135208531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416261158", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 856, "last_played": 1680515816}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game.

games where it felt revolutionary because it felt completely fresh in several ways, delivering an intriguing and uniquely rendred world, with painterly flair given to environments and characters. Dishonored 2 doesn't take any major steps like that forward - and yet it is a great game and a great sequel.\n\nFor those unaware, Dishonored is this first person stealth and combat game with open levels, magic powers, and staple for videogames moral choices of \"do you kill or just knock a guy out\". Which doesn't sound that exciting when spoken, but thing is, they really nail it, the levels are fun explore because there's resources to collect but also narrative bits of storytelling and environmental design to explore, there's always a few passages and options to pick from, and any problem has several solutions, including stuff developers didn't foresee, stuff like physics and combining powers can get pretty crazy fun to mess with.\n\nAnother bit is the world, well thought out, and devs took great effort to make it convincing and show it off in many ways. The world is truly intriguing, Victorian era, steampunk but not really, with occult cosmic horror supernatural but offering some real sense mystery to it. In the sequel here, instead of grim not-London Dunwall you go to sunny but as gloomy and violent Greece-inspired Karnaca. The place that went trough a golden age under previous ruler but under current duke people are getting poor and desperate as he squanders wealth. One really nice bit is how writers, artists and level designers really upped their ante with visual part, the city is real cool even if the average living areas like apartments are somewhat samey, but the core locales are all amazing, like inventor's mansion with sliding walls and platforms, arts conservatory squatted by supernatural, a royal palace that feels both fit for a 19th century monarch yet simultaneously immensely modernist. General narrative, while delivering some twists, sticks to same formula as original game, very closely so.\n\nGameplay-wise you get two characters now, with Emily Kaldwin the new character getting new powers, even if some are remixes of Korvo's, they're still offering fun takes, whereas Korvo sticks to old game's ones though with some additions. The equipment is mostly same as original, the flintlock, blade, crossbow with different bolts and some explosives, it's all still there, with additions. Nothing that would make a jaw drop but not fixing what's not broken either. Also the new game plus allows you to mix both characters unique powers, which can open up brand new possibilities.\n\nArt-wise, the environments are definitely the highlight, but everything else is also of finest Arkane quality. The stylization level is bit subtler than in original though, less warped and varied character proportions, less brushstrokes visible on brick textures. Would be sad if newer art direction wasn't as gorgeous.\n\nI recommend this, it's great and memorable. It's not too long of a game, just don't try to be mr perfect stealth pacifist on your very first run and have some fun messing with violent options too.", "timestamp_created": 1678922518, "timestamp_updated": 1678922518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497961819171905518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134700207": {"recommendationid": "134700207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316422270", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1678881128}, "language": "english", "review": "Stealth is boring.

Apparently it ran terribly on release, but that isn't surprising... Bethesda published the game.\n\nI can't speak for 2016 but in 2023 it feels like Arkane really took their time balancing the player's powers and map/level design, so the game looks and plays beautifully. However, I probably feel this way because I play on Iron Mode (one life, no reloading your save if you die), so having strong powers feels like a fair trade-off. \n\nAside from the wonderful gameplay, the world itself looks great and feels very alive. NPCs across each map are having little conversations with one another, sharing information you may need to know and giving flavor to the world. There are various collectibles to find, all of which feel good to stumble upon but aren't crucial to find. There's always more than one way to reach your destination. There's even a healthy amount of true replayability in the game: there are various \"this or that\" choices over the course of the game which can steadily change how the story develops as well as measurements of how stealthy or aggressive you play which has an immediate and obvious impact on the world. \n\nHighly recommend you buy this, even at full price, because it's easily worth the $30 price tag.

I really did. I really enjoyed Dishonored 1, but this game has the issues sequels do. It falls flat, but not how you'd expect.\n\nPros: Game has some interesting powers, the possession and shadow-sneak are great. The level designs are lovely, easily the best part of the game. Combat is fine, it feels fluid and dynamic. \n\n\nCons I'm 80% sure any game tester was drunk as fuck. There are many faults, the physics are wonky, and result in npcs dying from arbitrary things such as them falling onto a flaming bottle. Being spotted from across the map while in a bush, while simultaneously being able to walk right next to another npc while in light and not be spotted. Trying to stealth while collecting things is equivalent to injecting stables into your fingernails. Guards are both hyper alert and dumb because the AI is terrible. The characters are...mediocre at best. Powers sometimes just...will not work the way they should, especially the teleport, good luck ever using teleport to go down. If you were to compare this to a game that I find has good stealth, Metro Exodus, it falls flat a lot. Bonecharms feel heavily combat focused, and if you are trying to stealth/non-lethal 80% of them are entirely useless. It's like the game wants to promote being non-leathal to be a good person while going heavily out of the way to punish you as a player and character. It's easily the most frustrated I've been at a game in a very long time. Finally, the biggest issue; graphics. it's not that it doesn't look good, because it actually looks great, but you will struggle to actually look at it because you'll want to throw up, between the odd refresh rate, the mouse movements, FOV water effects and head bobbing it's like trying to ride a tilt-a-while and play an FPS at the same time, I've never had a game make me this nauseous, and i'm not the only one. I really do not understand how a game tester could have missed how dizzying the game makes you feel from only an hour or two of moving around.\n\nCompared to Dishonored 1 I find this game immensely less fun and quite frustrating overall, and I basically feel sick anytime I play it due to many glaring issues of the graphical decisions made by the dev team. I still plan to beat the game before I rate it on story, but even that feels much more flat than Dh1. I'm around the last few chapters as I write my review, but I highly doubt there'll be a twist big enough to make me take back the negative for the story.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game a solid 3 or 4/10. The biggest deduction coming from the nausea, some from a flat feeling story and a little bit on the AI, but I never expected much from a team run by Bethesda.

Por otro lado, gran parte de la historia y el worldbuilding dependen de que te hayas jugado al 1 para entenderlo, pero al mismo tiempo contradicen los finales malos, que dejan de ser canon, y reutilizan personajes (Delilah, cof, cof) y enteras tramas.

Although I encountered some bugs and glitches while playing, they didn't impact my experience heavily. The leveldesign is one of the strongest aspects of the franchise and D2 did not dissapoint. Many different ways to get to a goal. [spoiler] My favorite mission is probably The \"Clockwork Mansion\" or  \"A Crack in the Slab\", as both really are the best examples of phenomenal leveldesign. That and fricking time travel, duh. [/spoiler]\nThe plot is pretty straight forward. There wasn't really a major twist, at least none that Dishonored fans didn't see a mile away... The interesting new and old characters got fleshed out and given some more background and personality, which I really appreciate. That doesn't make up for the lack of a twist or interesting narrative though. The only compelling narrative is the chaos system, but I think the impact of this system fails to make it feel like your playstyle impacts anything that happens around you. They do impact some things, but I do feel like it could have been more polarizing.\nThe worldbuilding is as stellar as in the first game. Really liked the change of pace from the dingy, dark alleys of Dunwall City to the bright and lively streets of Karnaca. In addition to that the graphics are stunning and still hold up in 2023. I really like the artstyle and feel that in D2 Akane really perfected it. The attention to detail is also a really nice touch and really shows how much love they put into the game.\nThe music is, as in the first game, excellent. It really sells the dark steampunk setting while still having this elegance to it, hinting at the royal aspect that stretches through the story [spoiler] (Emily getting her throne back/Corvo, Royal Protector, ending a coup to restore order). [/spoiler] I love the sounddesign, it really adds to immersion.\nI enjoyed collecting the achievements. They were challenging without being grindy or luckbased and really gave me the opportunity to experience the game through very different approaches and playstyles, as well as using mechanics that are usually rarely utilized in an immersive playthrough.\n\nIn summary; A great sequel to a great franchise. Plotwise not the greatest, but the game makes up for it in fun mechanics, leveldesign and love to detail in a compelling world.\n\nMechanics: 10/10\nPlot/characters: 6/10\nWorldbuilding: 10/10\nSound/Music: 10/10\nGraphics/aesthetics: 10/10\nAchievements: 10/10\n\n[b] Total: 9.3/10 [/b]\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677037687, "timestamp_updated": 1677037687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59200209379196167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133306515": {"recommendationid": "133306515", "author": {"steamid": "76561199183347655", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1675729886}, "language": "spanish", "review": "cuando vi a la princesa de peque\u00f1a nunca pense que le dedicaria tantas pajas, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1677003613, "timestamp_updated": 1677003613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133292392": {"recommendationid": "133292392", "author": {"steamid": "76561199133178830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1693302550}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I have ever played", "timestamp_created": 1676986473, "timestamp_updated": 1676986473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133282462": {"recommendationid": "133282462", "author": {"steamid": "76561199069841497", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1332, "last_played": 1678496969}, "language": "english", "review": "no", "timestamp_created": 1676969948, "timestamp_updated": 1676969948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133275690": {"recommendationid": "133275690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198441873111", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 799, "last_played": 1676956018}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Todo lo que estaba bien del 1, mejorado en el 2 y con cosas extras.\n\nUnico problema la deteccion es un asco, a veces te ven a 2km de distancia.", "timestamp_created": 1676956692, "timestamp_updated": 1676956692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133265188": {"recommendationid": "133265188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261583425", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2572, "last_played": 1697081195}, "language": "english", "review": "Arkane Studios be like: we give u cool gadjets and abilities, but u haven't use them for funny kills, u should stealth to get good canon end. \n\n\nBut still it's the best emersive sim line of games u can play today (i mean modern games), i wouln't lie 1st chapter got seems better for me, cause it's the game that changed many things in my game tastes. 2nd part brings many new skills, more complex levels and plenty of interresting characters. if u like Dishonored 1, u'll enjoy 2nd part, this is one of the best examples of sequels", "timestamp_created": 1676939978, "timestamp_updated": 1676939978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518248140811920166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133262166": {"recommendationid": "133262166", "author": {"steamid": "76561199010340758", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2100, "last_played": 1677265099}, "language": "english", "review": "Yup, it's worth it.

I absolutely recommend it to anybody who has an appreciation for level design, artistic direction and atmosphere in video games. Arkane Studios is, in my opinion, leading the field in these categories and I have never played a game with such intricate attention to detail and no game apart from this has shown complete mastery of the ability to tie level design and level interaction with world building, atmosphere and ambience. \n\nFrom the first mission, regardless of if you have played the first Dishonored, (which I very much recommend as well) the world shows you its history, its culture, its traditions, its politics, and how its people live almost purely through level design. This is a recurring theme in the game; Arkane Studios shows a mastery of world building without shoving dialogue in your face which in most games is distracting and tedious. The world of Dishonored however, perfectly accommodates for the natural gameplay progression you take as you move through the world. The game rewards you for exploring, it rewards you for showing a curiosity in the world, while also inspiring and nurturing that curiosity as you play. There is almost never a wrong way to do things, and doing things your own way is also rewarded, you rarely feel as if you have been forced to do something in a way you don't want to, and the game lays out a myriad of options for you to progress with. Around my 15th playthrough of the game, i had still discovered new secrets, new answers, and sometimes new questions of the world that the game builds around you. The immersion is unmatched in the industry and the gameplay mechanics never feel like they're fighting the immersion, rather gently encouraging it. Something I love about the approach taken in the game is the choice it gives you to read more about the world. Scattered around your environment are notes, posters, book extracts, even conversations between people that are totally optional to interact with or observe, but if you choose to really embrace the search for knowledge about the world around you, offer such a rewarding and interesting pool of world building and development that can encourage more and more playthroughs of the game. The world around you changes, sometimes subtly and sometimes massively depending on your choices, and you can play the game so many times and experience a noticeably different world each time. This is not just in reference to the chaos system, but there are also different choices separate from that which also make impacts on the world and even small things like wanted posters change depending on if you've been spotted at all, for example.\n\nTo touch on the gameplay a little, I truly believe Dishonored as a whole are the only games to have mastered the first person stealth genre. The difficulty is customisable, with difficulty options feeling organic and natural, while increasing the difficulty for those wanting a challenge, but also easier options for those wanting to take the time to sink themselves into the world and atmosphere without worrying about enemies. The powers feel intuitive to use and all of them are worth exploring, with the rune system creating another reason to explore to try new powers. Even disregarding the powers, the swordplay and sneaking mechanics feel great and natural and the movement is smooth and feels like it follows the player's inputs very well. There are a myriad of both lethal and non lethal options to take down enemies which encourages you to play the game how you want to and also allows you to set fun challenges like Ghost/Clean Hands runs. I play hard-stealth 99% of the time so I can't speak much on the combat but from what I have tried and seen it is very enjoyable and offers a lot of creativity and lets you think on your feet as you fight.\n\nOverall, Dishonored is an experience you will not get from any other game and has so much replay value for so many reasons that I definitely recommend it to anyone considering it.", "timestamp_created": 1676649895, "timestamp_updated": 1676650149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133023138": {"recommendationid": "133023138", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026334764", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 18042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15239, "last_played": 1677397732}, "language": "english", "review": "Dishonored 2 is a fun game, and those who enjoyed the first one (and it's DLCs) will enjoy it, especially the gameplay, though sometimes it can be a tiny bit awkward, or certain mechanics won't work as expected in some circumstances.

As a fan of the stealth genre, I found the game to be both thrilling and challenging. The game is set in a beautifully crafted world that is filled with detail, from the sprawling city of Karnaca to the hidden secrets lurking in every corner. The level design is remarkable and varied, allowing for a range of gameplay styles and approaches.\n\nOne of the strengths of Dishonored 2 is the choice it gives to players in terms of gameplay style. As with the first game, players can choose to play as either a ruthless assassin or a more stealthy and non-lethal approach. This flexibility ensures that the game is suitable for both aggressive players who want to engage in combat, as well as more strategic and patient players who prefer to remain unseen.\n\nIn terms of comparisons, Dishonored 2 shares similarities with the classic stealth game Thief 2. Both games offer intricate levels and an immersive world to explore, and both rely on stealth as the primary gameplay mechanic. However, Dishonored 2 brings a fresh and unique twist to the genre, incorporating magic abilities and a more fluid movement system that sets it apart from other games in the genre.\n\nWhile Dishonored 2 is an excellent game, it falls slightly short of its predecessor, Dishonored 1. The first game had a more cohesive and focused narrative, and the plot twists were more impactful. However, Dishonored 2 compensates for this with its improved gameplay mechanics and level design.\n\nOverall, Dishonored 2 is an excellent game that offers players a thrilling and challenging stealth experience. While it may not be quite as good as the first game in terms of narrative, it more than makes up for it with its incredible gameplay, world-building, and replayability. If you're a fan of the stealth genre or looking for a unique and engaging game to play, Dishonored 2 is definitely worth checking out.", "timestamp_created": 1676451417, "timestamp_updated": 1676451417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132879024": {"recommendationid": "132879024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312157969", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1401, "last_played": 1676428569}, "language": "english", "review": "Intricate and imaginative level design.

Awesome gameplay with a bunch of different ways to finish each task.\n2. Good stylistic and overall technical part of the game. No major bugs as well.\n3. Nice voice acting. The music is also pretty good.\n4. Level design is decent, but there is a lot of space for improvement, the main issue here is that the locations are very repetitive, and mostly not so well detailed.\nCons:\n1. AI could be better, all NPC's are not a threat to you in any difficulty except maybe \"Iron Mode\".\n2. Story is complete and obsolete trash. It has a huge amount of loopholes and zero logic.\n3. Chaos level system is too simple and does not work as it should, also I don't understand why it is required to play some \"Absolutely good\" role model without killing for example bandits or witches. Also, why do robots even count in this stat? Can't a good one be veracious and get rid of \"bad guys\" without a story/lore penalty?\n4. The game stimulates the player to kill (while from a story perspective, it's bad), and a lot of loot is specifically for \"high-chaos\" gameplay, if you want to play mostly pacifist-like you'll have only:|\n* Choking (Unaware or Counter-strike) \n* Tranquilizing bolt for the crossbow\n* Throwing some objects in the head (with a specific perk)\nI think a game like this needs much more non-lethal ways to eliminate guards and target itself, for example, as in the Hitman Trilogy.\n\nThe overall game is very amusing and could give you a nice pastime for a few evenings.\nMy subjective rate is 7 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1676155901, "timestamp_updated": 1676155901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132653337": {"recommendationid": "132653337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087374697", "num_games_owned": 530, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1459, "last_played": 1676148202}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si tenemos en cuenta al Dishonored 1, este queda con \"sabor a poco\", la historia es algo parecida al primero, las mec\u00e1nicas con iguales, casi hasta el final, donde se agrega algo un poco innovador.\nEn lineas generales es un buen juego, con una trama interesante, pero repetitiva", "timestamp_created": 1676148381, "timestamp_updated": 1676148381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132649329": {"recommendationid": "132649329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206286277", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1366, "last_played": 1676149361}, "language": "english", "review": "alot different but gameplay is very simmilar to the first", "timestamp_created": 1676144748, "timestamp_updated": 1676144748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132649071": {"recommendationid": "132649071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158375359", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1676144461}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1676144547, "timestamp_updated": 1676144547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132639908": {"recommendationid": "132639908", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968151246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5901, "last_played": 1672012256}, "language": "english", "review": "A worthy sequel.\n\nContains the greatest video game level I have ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1676137315, "timestamp_updated": 1676137315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132633757": {"recommendationid": "132633757", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007966622", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 967, "last_played": 1672829156}, "language": "english", "review": "For Emily.", "timestamp_created": 1676132583, "timestamp_updated": 1676132583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132621495": {"recommendationid": "132621495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115407986", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 889, "last_played": 1686376825}, "language": "english", "review": "I still liked Samuel more than a Meagan Foster who just appeared out of nowhere from the lore :') \n\nHighly recommend or in other words, do not buy this game if you haven't picked up the first one already.
