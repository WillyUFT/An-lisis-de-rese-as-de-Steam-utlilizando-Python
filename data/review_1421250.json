The writing is pretentious using way too many metaphors in the story which makes it a slog to read and get through. The story is also very cringe. There is a weird fixation on underage girls and a constant attempt to describe their beauty. I felt like I was playing a furry / loli dating simulator most of the time. I streamed the game to a community of people and I was not alone in this assessment. The vast majority of people watching felt this way.\n\nThe game also says it is non-linear but after 8 hours of \"gameplay\" and 4 chapters you make about 3 actual \"choices\". It is just hours and hours of bad reading, since there is no English voice acting available. This should not qualify as \"non-linear\" in my opinion. The fourth chapter is also extremely short compared to the rest, with zero choices in it even though the release notes say it was supposed to have more than previous chapters and have more \"mini-games\" then before. What those are I have no idea because the only thing it prompted me to actually do was to Accept a piece a candy, with zero way to reject it.\n\nI can not recommend this game at all. If this was a star rating system I'd give it 2 stars out of 5 and that is being nice.

The game masterfully employs visual and auditory cues to heighten tension, leaving you on edge as you navigate through this unnerving world. The surreal landscapes and nightmarish sequences create an unsettling ambience that keeps you immersed in an ever-growing sense of dread.\n\nAs you control the seemingly innocent protagonist, you'll quickly realize that \"Tiny Bunny\" is far from the typical cutesy visual novel it appears to be. The game delves into the psyche of the character, confronting deep-rooted fears and internal struggles. Each episode becomes a metaphorical journey through the bunny's mind, where symbolism and allegories abound, leaving players to decipher the meaning behind the disturbing imagery.\n\nThe psychological horror elements are further complemented by an exceptional sound design. From the subtle whispers that echo through the eerie corridors to the chilling soundtrack that ebbs and flows with the unfolding events, \"Tiny Bunny\" crafts an auditory experience that enhances the psychological terror to its full potential.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Tiny Bunny\" is a psychological horror game that excels at immersing players in a haunting world of fear and unease. It masterfully blends psychological torment with regular horror elements, challenging players to confront their own fears and emotions. While some storytelling aspects could be refined, the overall experience is a chilling and thought-provoking journey.

I really liked that each choice really does tinker with the outcome and ultimately leads to a different end in both the main story and character relationships.\n\nI've played through multiple endings and choices and still have yet to find out about the other ones.\n\nThis is definitely a good read and play through!

The characters are well written, likable and interesting. The story has twists and turns, and does a great job of building tension and making you question what is real. I felt myself quickly becoming invested in the world they have built, excitedly reading through the dialogue to see what happens next, and like I said, I never enjoy games like this. I am not very far into the game yet, but I should have went to sleep an hour ago, and I had a hard time turning it off. The pagan imagery, black and white art style, and music/sound do such a great job of creating a sense of fear and tension that constantly drives you forward - Even when just looking at text over a still image. Overall, I find Tiny Bunny to be EXTREMELY engaging and absolutely one of the best experiences this genre has to offer. \n\n- Even if you don't typically play games like this, I would highly recommend it! I look forward to completing the game and updating this review in the future. -", "timestamp_created": 1687504269, "timestamp_updated": 1687504646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140529718": {"recommendationid": "140529718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327322067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1103, "last_played": 1688081569}, "language": "english", "review": "bliss", "timestamp_created": 1687485838, "timestamp_updated": 1687485838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140523620": {"recommendationid": "140523620", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126217072", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1715, "last_played": 1690683438}, "language": "english", "review": "giga chad dad saved me when i passed out in the forest. \u2661", "timestamp_created": 1687475331, "timestamp_updated": 1687475331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693054437637329102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140519512": {"recommendationid": "140519512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273618596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1687467919}, "language": "english", "review": "I think it's like an Everlasting Summer (I have not played many visual novels)\nBut it's horror. \nAnd the story is more interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1687469084, "timestamp_updated": 1687469084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140514392": {"recommendationid": "140514392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311078054", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1732, "last_played": 1694392964}, "language": "english", "review": "if you choose choose polina for any reason other than acheivements unistall the game just stop you might as well sleep in a hot bed of coals because thats basically the same feeling if not worse than the bed of coals\ni havent read 1 lick of her dialouge . i became so fast at clicking i might be professional button masher", "timestamp_created": 1687462750, "timestamp_updated": 1687462750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140502744": {"recommendationid": "140502744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256906380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 158, "last_played": 1687510771}, "language": "english", "review": "This is honestly amazing.\nThere is a constant sense of mystery and fear with many different things to chose from\nThe Graphics, while only black and white work amazingly\nAnd the Soundtrack keeps you on edge\n\n10/10.

Mermaids\". Also without a clear explanation, but with a smart look they say that the game is not for peasants.\n\nAn objective assessment is extremely negative even by the standards of visual novels. This product has been developed since 2016, and the year is 2023, and this is despite the fact that only 4 out of 5 episodes have been released. By the way, we are talking about a visual novel, and not about an RPG in the open world ... I remind you. The fourth episode was made for 1.5 years and many are wondering what they were doing all this time? I will answer you: They played fan service with the audience. for some unknown reason, for some reason they call it manga). Content in episode 4 for 10-15 minutes and only a couple of choices that don\u2019t really affect anything. The choices in episode 4 are not based on the choices in previous episodes, but in the current one, and then these choices are from the hand of the screenwriter has its own opinion and your choice is not taken into account at all, which is generally ridiculous. Considering the fact that in the story and its intrigue, the intricacies of the plot dragged out only two episodes from the fans and even from me, who considered himself a fan until recently there were a lot of theories about what kind of mysticism and devilry happened in the game. The third episode was marking time and generally remove it from the game and nothing will change and I'm serious now. played, that in general there was an opinion about which below. People who bought the official comic book about Katya Smernova, who as a character was revealed from the positive sides, and in the fourth episode her child of 12 years old was simply allowed to mince in the truest sense of the word. raises a number of questions about the state of mind of the artists and the screenwriter of the project. Is everything okay with your head there? This is despite the fact that the authors officially confirmed her death. Why? Why did you release a comic about a character that fans began to love and feel sorry for? blender? I\u2019m already silent that there is enough bad news in the real world, as well as this incomprehensible pedo-guro content for which you paid money. and he makes such moans that even women with low social responsibility don\u2019t do it for money. Then there\u2019s the child rape scene ... I won\u2019t be surprised at all. Not only do the characters change their character by 180 degrees, but also all the content is clearly aimed at fans of dismemberment and lolicon, which is already a verdict not for the game, but for those who make it.\n\nNow, without further ado. Considering that only 4 episodes out of 5 came out, and the last episode, taking into account the trend of \"development\" and the desire to squeeze the last money out of a half-dead project from its audience, the final will most likely be released no earlier than 2025-2026. I am more than sure that the finale will be as chaotic, crumpled, squeezed as possible, and like a killer (an explanation of what is happening, the star) in the game L.A. Noir will jump out of the bushes and all the fan theories will fly like a forest. It's funny, it's also worth noting that when you state these facts about the sudden sexualization of characters ( even when my characters were 12 years old, I didn\u2019t have such spermotoxicosis) who are 12 years old and who study in the 6th grade, then you immediately fly into a ban.\n\n\u041f\u0438\u0448\u0443 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043a \u043e\u0442 10.06.2023 \n\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u044b \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c,\u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a \"\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044b\" \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0430\u0434\u0435\u043f\u0442\u044b \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0442\u044b \u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0449\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432. \n\n\u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435.\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043e\u043d \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0434 \u0432 \u0447\u0443\u0436\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435. \u0423 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f \u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0441 \u041a\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0439 (\u043f\u0440\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438). \u042f \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u044f\u0438\u0446 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442. \n\nI am writing this segment from 06/10/2023\nAfter reading other people's reviews and reviews, it turned out that I am not alone in an objective assessment of this so-called game and it is extremely funny to watch how \"fans\" like adherents of a sect are trying to ineptly protect developers.\n\nNow the most interesting.

DLC crap. There's a lot of great episodic games that ruin themselves like that.\n\nBut onto the actual game, I am not the biggest fan of VN's, but this is hands down a great horror game on its own terms. It mixes a lot of different types of horror to give you a good dreadful experience: Powerlessness and naivete of childhood within an adult world (like Coraline), monstrous guts and blood (like most slasher flicks) and even the daylight doesn't save you from the strange, near Lynchian aspects of the other characters and the town itself that seem to become stranger as the game goes on.\n\nBesides that, the art style and the music and cultural references to 90s Russia really rock.

details. The art is what catched my eye, it's cute and pleasant to look at, it has its own unique charme imo. The ambient sound and voice acting are 1A+ (pretty fucking good, love them). Especially the voice lines being in the original language, damn i can feel how alive the characters are. I enjoyed exploring the relationships between the characters, that you can choose where it can go and it is pretty realistic too. The game isn't superficial (the topics you see ingame are touching, from real ones like bullying, preciousness of the connection with his little sister and others to i guess a little bit of surreal, mysterious things to yet to be uncovered (My suspish tells me some clues, but that would be spoilers.). You can emphasize with so many characters. Makes you think back and appreciate what you have more. Scary scenes are really well done and are rather of a non typical nature, very refreshing to be scared by unexpected stuff (The scene with the TV (I legit found that face to be hella creepy as a kid, so i jumped.).\n\nSo far the 2 episodes I played were a jorney worth my time/money and i even replayed some parts, made other choices and will gladly come back and replay the whole game again. A little hidden gem. Can't wait for the next episode :) 666/10 I recommend <3\n\n(Not sure if the voice lines will be ever made in another language (or are already have been made) than russian tho, kinda want everybody to enjoy the voices.

So far there are four chapters out and each one has been better than the last. Each takes a very different approach to horror and the story as a whole very differently and every time you think you understand what's going on Anton's sanity is questioned more and everything becomes jumbled again. The use of jumpscares which I normally don't care for are so well used and actually scary even though they come at expected times, but this game uses the vn format to elevate the horror so well it's incredible. The art and backgrounds are captivating and beautiful. The art style is amazing as well and adds so much to the game.\nI also love that this game's choices matter so much. The game is quite short after only one playthrough, but there's so much you'll miss if you only play it once as every single choice has many different things that can happen that are done quite well and add to the mystery. \nI think if you like horror or good mysteries and vns this is a really good game to play and even if you just play one playthrough it's still a good game. I would highly recommend and hope the series keeps getting better!", "timestamp_created": 1673070413, "timestamp_updated": 1685666297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

release would turn out, and that's from only playing up to 3 episodes so far at the time of typing this review. \n\nA little bit standard if you're looking at it at face value as we play as a 'foreigner' relocated to a new environment where they get bullied, have their 'first' school crush, and still finding it hard to connect to their parents due to them working all the time. But what made this game unique is it is based in Russian, bringing in some interesting dramatic and world-building as well as developing the premise to fit realistically with the setting. It was refreshing for me to experience and learn a bit about the cultural references and the language to see from their point of view. Everything is spoken in Russian, with few subtitles to choose from, sometimes I forget about it as the voice acting was spoken with pure passion it's crazy how much emotion I witness coming from my monitor. \n\nEach episode is about an hour and a half or less long with minimal choices but their choices can have a major impact in the later episode I found revealing some more secrets and lore surrounding missing children a people wearing weird animal masks that much I would spoiler. There's a lot of mystery to unpack, from making different choices, at least for me I couldn't help going through multiple save files and seeing how different scenarios play out to the point I'm struggling to figure out which one of my own saved files is the original, not that I mind. \n\nNot only is this game's storyline in-depth, but the mucky and polished art style is splendid to look at, along with camera focus that made some scenery tension grabbing and uniquely grim, so expect for a few 'good' jumpscare as good horror game who tease you with it. \n\nBut before anyone decide to get invested in this series, I need to mention that there was a problem with every previous save file getting corrupted when Episode 3 was released. Not that I mind as I can skip to the scene that was lost. Plus, the developer was apologetic about the issue. Just something to mention in case something like this happens again, because of that maybe hold out on playing this game until is it fully released. Keep it on the back burner until then, or just play the Prologue of the first episode for free to see for yourself if you would like it, taking about an hour 1 and a half max to complete.\n\nAs for me, I'm definitely looking forward to playing the rest of the episodes (with episode 4 coming in 2023, hopefully) to get an explanation, like why are people dressed in animal costumes (and where did all those candies come from).", "timestamp_created": 1670755857, "timestamp_updated": 1685488810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684964001178741455",

The only criticism I have is that the English translation can be a little off here and there but overall it's a great translation from the source language. The glossary is very helpful and interesting to read since it sheds light on a time and culture that I am not particularly familiar with, which makes the world that much more believable and real. I can't really comment on the voice acting because I don't understand Russian but it sounds good to me, and the fact that it is fully voiced in the first place is impressive enough as it is.

I had seen \"Tiny Bunny Prologue\" (which is the first chapter and it is free for those who don't know) a while ago and downloaded it.

There are a lot of very memorable moments in the first chapter alone. While the first one focuses more on a horror mystery, the other two chapters that are available at the time of me writing this, are more story focused and expand the characters a bit. \n\nIt wasn't quite the story I had expected going into it, but it was absolutely worth playing nonetheless. There are a bunch of desicions you can make, that are surprisingly hard and impact what exactly is going to happen, giving the game a great replay value. The price of the full game is also very generous, making it worth the money. \nTwo more chapters are in the making, meaning that my total amount of playtime for 3/5 of the game (without replaying it) was about 9 or 10 hours, given that I spent about 3 to 4 hours on the free first chapter and then 5.5 hours on the second and third chapter.

The music is great, the translation is fantastic. Since the game is set in Russia, I love the inclusion of  glossary for words, phrases, places etc that people may not be aware of.\n\nThe art style is also fantastic, black and white is great choice for a game that is set in a rural snowy town. They also love to switch up the style which I appreciate, it's not just still images, there's animation as well, there's a great moment where there's a still image of the snowy forest and in the distance is the blurry outline of two kids kicking another kid and it looks almost fmv it was eerily uncanny.\n\nAbsolutely give this ago.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1641119840, "timestamp_updated": 1687429377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534225046634674072", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107122795": {"recommendationid": "107122795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045941856", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1641114200}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no idea what I just played, but I loved every minute of it.

The protagonist has like a dozen thoughts on ever small line of dialogue. It's excessively wordy to the point of \"Is all this additional detail necessary or...?\" The kids also apparently really like Disney films seeing how they mention about 5 or 6 of them specifically by name. Seems like a silly thing to nitpick, but honestly, is it relevant the cinderalla or peter pan is mentioned? Will this story draw a comparison to those stories, or is this just a detail from the author who really likes these cartoons and wants to include them in the game?\nI also just wasn't particularly gripped by the narrative. Some kid is missing, protagonist sees some spooky animals in the forest, little sister keeps seeing a creature outside her window, etc. There's not reason for this kid to be exploring the forest other than curiosity and I'm fairly certain the only time these creatures are going to attack these kids in the house is when their parents have some reason to be away from the house for a night. I don't know, just kind of boring.\nIt's not all negative though, I genuinely really like the art style of this game. It's incredibly well done and portrays a very cold and dark atmosphere. The characters are drawn very well and seem to portray more personality than the writing will seem to give to them. Sound design is good. I also though the jump scares were effective and didn't feel cheap.\nI don't know, maybe I'll revisit this game once it's fully released but from what I read that won't be until 2023. I hope I'm wrong about the story later and it's actually going to amount to something but my first impressions are pretty lukewarm.

Not only is the art, music and story stellar (at least so far), what I'm most impressed by is how creatively the devs are able to use the medium of visual novels, something that's incredibly stale these days, to weave a story that's constantly keeping you on edge. I've read dozens of VNs and I can only think of a few that so brutally pushes the engine and so ingeniously packs it with amazing visuals. The horror masterfully jumps from childlike fear to dark folklore to socioeconomic anxiety and, lastly, to sheer psychological terror. As a kid who grew up in the post-Soviet world especially, a lot of the scares and sense of dread definitely works at scratching up some old forgotten wounds (which I'm all for lol). The only two things I can fault it for right now is that, 1) the engine really is being pushed to the limit and so the game can occasionally stutter, and, 2) the translation, while not bad to the point that it'll take you out of the experience, certainly isn't perfect.

Elementary - use SFX. That's what is so charming of this - how I dare to call it - peace of art. I don't remember that many games where it's paid so much heed to the sound, especially in a visual novel genre. I've played with Russian voice acting, as I wanted to have an authentic experience, and I can vouch that every subtle sound in the background was in place, every voice line sounded enjoyably smooth, I coundn't help but wonder how natural (and not cringy!) everything sounds, specifically to a Russian-speaking person, such as myself. Not to mention the music, oh, the music. I've actually felt anxious whenever a \"creepy theme\" would pop up. The guys who are responsible for the music should really get the credit.\n\nAs for the visuals.. they are simply gravy. The background images and the character design are appealing (the protagonist's little sister is pretty much an anime character, though I have no problems with that). There's even a [spoiler]ominous furry fox-[/spoiler]girl who hangs out with the protagonist, boy, I'm sold!\n\nIt's a shame that there are only 2 out of 5 episodes available yet, but I'm really looking forward to learn how the story will be developed and tailored by the player's choices (remember, this is \"a non-linear horror visual novel\"?).

Pretty much everything about what is presented is fantastic. The art is beautiful, the prose of the narration is stunning, the sound and music add to the atmosphere incredibly well. The story itself feels rather uncomfortably authentic (especially the school bullying). It's easy to get invested. You'll feel for Anton, your heart will go out for Olya, the family struggles are real and you'll feel just as uneasy as him going to school.\n\nAs a game, it progresses marvelously. There are choices that pop up that are genuinely difficult to make and something as simple as searching for a VHS tape versus fiddling with TV reception was made honestly hard to choose thanks to the strength of the story. For as short as the game is (two chapters as of this review) the writers do an excellent job of leading our emotions. I admit fully to getting an adrenaline rush when Anton put the mask on and the subsequent events hit me just as hard.\n\nThat said, there are two rather severe caveats here. One is that if you're expecting this to be an animal-based fantastical story of some kind (based on the title, logo, and several of the images), don't. This is much more Life is Strange than anything. It's got a few gently supernatural elements but is otherwise heavily grounded, at least thus far. The animal people the store page has you expecting aren't at all what they look like they're gonna be.\n\nThe second issue is what made this so hard to recommend or not, and that's the length. Eight bucks for a game you can finish in two hours isn't a problem in my mind (that's basically a movie), but this is two episodes of a five episode project that isn't set to finish for another two years. It's hard to recommend people putting money down on something that is so far from completion without being able to say with confidence that the full game is worth the investment. These two chapters are an excellent experience, but this isn't an episodic game. These episodes are only scratching the surface of what the game is promising and it's going to be a long while before we get the rest of it.\n\nIn the end, I refuse to give this game a thumbs down because it's so, so beautifully done that I want it to keep that \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" it has, but I also think that it might be prudent for many people to wait. Right now, I feel a bit blue-balled by it, and not quite in an eager anticipation way, but more that I only got the appetizer and have to wait for a main course. I just hope the project makes it to completion and it lives up to the promise what is currently there makes.", "timestamp_created": 1631418296, "timestamp_updated": 1631418296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.73131030797958374", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99038420": {"recommendationid": "99038420", "author": {"steamid": "76561199090260872", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1641789785}, "language": "english", "review": "Top notch visual novel with good jump scares and multiple story routes.

The characters seem to be very interesting, the plot has some twists, the choices matter (especially in the 2d chapter). I can't tell yet whether the choices will be able to affect the ending or not but so far I am very pleased with this visual novel and I will (of course) update the review with the release of more chapters or if my opinion changes)\n+ The scares are on point! This game knows when to add a little jumpscare and how to create a tense moment. I had chills down my spine during some moments of the game and the other made me jump. I really love the horror aspect of this experience!\n+ The art style is so good! I absolutely love it. It's just very pretty to look at which is very important in the visual novel type of game.\n+ Fair price (in my opinion)\n\n- There are only 2 chapters so it's very difficult to judge the story or the ending. No one knows where this adventure will take us and also we'll have to wait a very long time before the release of other chapters.\n- Since it's a visual novel, there is a lot of reading which is ok, but some of the moments feel really dragged out in my personal opinion.\n\nOverall:\nI'd rate this little horror adventure 8.6 bunnies /10 so far. I can't wait for more chapters to see how the story will evolve! I would strongly recommend experience this horror story.

That's not BAD per-say. I'm a man that chose to go on a date with the fox girl; but there's a lot of content that they should've just cut down, like a decent editor would've cut out half of the snowball fight with Alissa(Fox girl) and would'ce cut out like 3/4ths of the bullying scene in the woods. Seriously that bullying scene just went ON and ON and ON and while I know it was all servicing the ending; by the time I GOT to the ending of episode two I was more happy because it finally ended than I was about what actually happened (Though, episode two does have a VERy good ending, at least in my choices.)\n\nTL/DR: I like the game, but I really wouldn't recommend anyone spend money on it right now. I'd hold off until episode 3 is released, and then if that one drags itself out longer than this review (Self deprication ;) ) then I'd just leave it alone entirely. However, if they do episode 3 like episode 1 with a lot of fun intrigue and weird shit happening, then I'd totally recommend it. \nEither way, wait and watch, episode 3 will be the real test for this one.", "timestamp_created": 1628238504, "timestamp_updated": 1628238504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96408268": {"recommendationid": "96408268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418891696", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 156, "last_played": 1670111657}, "language": "english", "review": "I am absolutely in love with this game and there is nothing bad I can say about it. I played the prologue and purchased this version as soon as it was possible but I have only finished it today. \n\nTiny Bunny is incredible. There's an engaging storyline, breathtaking artwork and perfectly chosen voice actors. There's also a glossary of terms that you encounter as you play the game - they are not necessary to play but your knowledge of those terms enhances the experience and you are able to understand the plot and the history of the family and the current situation in the game more. \n\nThis is a game where your choices truly matter and they have a huge impact of how other characters treat you and refer to you, especially in Episode 2. Your choices also count because there are some things that you will encounter only after choosing one thing over the other.\n\nThe dialogues and the words used in the game are really beautiful, further improving the game experience. I speak English fluently and have been learning Russian for a few months now, so hearing the original voice actors in the background is another factor that differentiates Tiny Bunny from similar games. As I said before - the voice actors are perfect. You can look at the character and imagine what they would sound like and this is it, this is what you get. \n\nArtwork in this game is also incredibly good. From still drawing of the surroundings, through many drawings of the characters with various facial expressions to scary elements and cutscenes - they're all amazing. There's a lot of details in the drawings (especially when it comes to Semyon!) and you can truly guess the character's personality based on what they were portrayed like. \n\nTiny Bunny is one of the few games that I have been so impressed with and I cannot recommend it enough.

It told all the essential things about characters and the family's history. Not long after the start it started to get a little creepy and I got really into that. I've realized the music does a lot in this game.\n\n<Chapter 2>\n\nCh 2 was chill and all because characters did ordinary things that people do really. And they just went to school for 1 day. After the day at school main character goes to escrot his friend to her home. Not long after snowman part all things will be hecking scary and you will be so confused in many parts of chapter 2.\n\n\n---Did i like it?---\n\nI liked this game so much that I am going to play this game again so long that i get all achievements for this game. Worth every cent. (only 8,19\u20ac). I didn't get bored at any part of the game because this game's story hooked me in with it's horror and all! I recommend you play this game at night or at dark like I did!\n\nWell this was my early access review and i will modify this when new chapters come!

I especially enjoyed the clever use of voice acting for dialogues between the characters in game. The voice acting was done in Russian, which adds immersion to being involved in the story set in a rural village in Russia. The music was also on point, with suspenseful music being used for certain scenes, thus heightening the intensity of fear and anxiety. The story moved along flawlessly between static and animated scenes, complementing the story being told. It is like reading a novel that comes alive. There are some choices to be made, which ultimately changes the storyline.\n\nI don't want to reveal any spoiler, but I truly enjoy this game and highly recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1622716436, "timestamp_updated": 1622716436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613007903099060059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93084018": {"recommendationid": "93084018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061695809", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 521, "last_played": 1622689111}, "language": "english", "review": "Looking forward for the next episodes!\nAmazing visual novel.", "timestamp_created": 1622689625, "timestamp_updated": 1622689625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495567947626113892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93020065": {"recommendationid": "93020065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024410069", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1622589545}, "language": "english", "review": "don't be deceived by the overwhelming majority of the positive reviews, it's not a horror game and it's incomplete", "timestamp_created": 1622589932, "timestamp_updated": 1622589932, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442361742258071899", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92980998": {"recommendationid": "92980998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164029685", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1645867791}, "language": "english", "review": "mm yes very good game is my favorite", "timestamp_created": 1622537449, "timestamp_updated": 1622537449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495567947626113892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92971463": {"recommendationid": "92971463", "author": {"steamid": "76561199051681201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1630806269}, "language": "english", "review": "this game has a amazing art style and a great story so far and the voice acting is very good as well i would definitely recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1622519882, "timestamp_updated": 1622519882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495567947626113892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92895484": {"recommendationid": "92895484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198974493259", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1622154858}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome", "timestamp_created": 1622409370, "timestamp_updated": 1622409370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541055560111999512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92852739": {"recommendationid": "92852739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018239490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1689222234}, "language": "english", "review": "The voice acting, art, story, music, and ambient noises are great!

Not only because of the impressive visual part, but also thanks to the horror genre and lots of positive reviews. Well, it is finally time for me to join the party in the scary forest. Better late than sorry, yeah? \n\nAnd just a small note: I have extra warm feelings towards this game because it was made by Russian developers. Call it biased, but there is nothing I can do about it, sorry. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2490809129\n\n[h1]In The Dark, Dark Forest\u2026[/h1]\n\nThis visual novel truly shines in terms of atmosphere and aesthetics. From black and white pictures to masterfully selected music, from the mystery of what is actually happening to unbearable anticipation of a disaster \u2013 just everything, even the tiniest bit, works oh so perfectly together. And at the same time, you will never doubt that you are reading a horror story and not some slice-of-life or romcom pretending to be one. There are also various point-and-click features, so gameplay feels more interactive and immersive.\n\nThe writing is really good. Some scenes are unsettling, even disturbing. The store page gives a fair warning about it, so do not get tricked by the characters \u2013 children can be scary too, and cruel, oh so devilishly cruel. There are some cliches, but honestly, you will most probably just overlook them. The plot builds the suspense slowly, but surely, step by step bringing you into the clutches of cold dread. There were several moments that really caught me off guard. And there I was, sitting in a sun-bright room, shivering from uneasiness and listening to my fast-beating heart. The same as the protagonist, you just cannot get rid of the feeling that something is wrong with the forest. Something dark is coming, and it is hungry. \n\nSpeaking of the visual part, it is gorgeous. Heck, just look at the screenshots on the store page! Not only is the art style unique, but the pictures are also partially animated, and at some points you will even see short videos. User interface is neat and goes really well with CGs and backgrounds. \n\nAnd oh my God, the music! I have a soft spot for piano and music-box-like tunes. And an even softer one for disturbing ones. The music here checks all boxes on my list, so I purchased the soundtrack collection almost right away. Just stay in the main menu for a bit and listen to the track \u2013 and you will understand what I mean. Huge kudos to the composer(s) for their great work.\n\nOf course, I cannot but mention sounds too. The very first one you hear \u2013 howling of the cold winter wind, harsh and indifferent to the lives of silly humans, - sets just the right mood of dread and loneliness. And then it switches to a cheerful tune of everyday life, clicking of knives and forks on the plate. So careless and simple. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2490808485\n\nHowever, there is a small fly in the ointment for people who do not understand Russian. The game is fully voiced, but only in Russian. English and Chinese versions do not have their own voice-overs and use the one mentioned above instead. But man is it good! Reminds me of audio creepypastas that I have recently got used to listening. \n\nNow, another very important for me part \u2013 quality of translation. Russian is my native language, but I played the game in English to write this review. Thanks to Russian audio, I was able to compare both versions without constantly switching the settings. And I should say, the translators did a great job. The text feels authentic, and it is also easy to read. I might have missed some parts or just did not pay attention to others (I am not native, after all), but to me, English version has nothing to complain about. But I also always say, that no matter how good you are at both languages, there are some things that you just cannot explain in English. Russian is far more expressive in terms of words, while English relies more on intonation and stress. So, in my opinion, the translated version feels a bit drier than the original. But again, this is unavoidable. On a side note: there is a Glossary that explains some interesting terms and words (like Babai, for example; who is not a relative of Babushka, by the way). \n\n[h1]\u2026Evil Creatures Are Waiting For Their Prey[/h1]\n\nAs you can see, there are a lot of things that I can praise Tiny Bunny for. To be honest, I can think of only one concerning things about it (if we do not count the lack of English or Chinese voice-overs). A very noticeable thing (at least for some people) about Tiny Bunny is that it is currently in Early Access. What does it mean for the game itself? First, that it does not have all the content it will have at the final version. The developers are planning to release five chapters in total, and only two of them are available right now. Second, the content might change at any moment if the developers decide so. It might happen that there will be only 3 chapters, or maybe they will opt for 7 or 10 instead. We do not know for now. To sum up, if you do not want to wait or are afraid that the game will never be finished \u2013 and let us be honest here, this happens to EA games from time to time, sadly, - then you should not purchase this visual novel and wait for the full release instead. Simple and clear. \n\nAt the same time, Early Access also gives us, the community, a chance to influence the game \u2013 where it goes in some aspects, how it is written, what mistakes were made and which ones can be avoided in the future. Tiny Bunny has a bright future, and we can make it even better. \n\nAnd a small note at the end: the game feels a bit short right now, but I am pretty sure that it will not be the case as soon as all chapters get released.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2490808666\n\n[h1]Will You Dare To Look For Truth There?[/h1]\n\nIn the end, the last question I have to answer is whether I would recommend this visual novel or not. And of course, I will say yes, absolutely. [b]Tiny Bunny[/b] is turning out to be a very well-made visual novel; it might become even a masterpiece in the genre, I dare say. Everything is on point here, at least for now. And I liked small details connected with Russian daily life from the 90s and my own childhood \u2013 whether it is UAZ (which is manufactured in my native city), Tamagotchi, cassette players, Black Kitty book series and other things that were not that important for the story, but still helped to set the background for it. It sometimes also gives this warm feeling of reading a campfire story, until everything gets twisted into murky darkness full of scary shadows.\n\nSo, as you have already understood, I enjoyed the game immensely.

I'm going to keep this one short and simple because there are only two episodes out of five right now. This interactive fiction title is immersive; from sound, to music, the voice acting, all the animations, and even tool tips. All voice work is in Russian which is great because it adds to the authenticity of the work, culture, and folklore. On top of that you get this Soviet history lesson as you're playing, which is where the tool tips are predominantly used, that give major insight into not just the narrative but especially the entire feel and setting of the time period this story takes place in. All of the characters are believably voice acted, but my favorite is definitely the elusive Alisa as she sounds [i]sexy[/i][b]AF[/b] since her voice actress killed it with this character on every single line with her enunciation, expression of emotion, and the nuances that have to be filled in to make an unbelievable(?) character convincing. Props to the sound design team as well for getting the mix just right for the character's voice effect, providing a mysterious yet otherworldly vibe from each and every syllable. There are decisions in the story which do affect how the story plays out (thus far), point & click adventure gameplay that leans more on the hidden object end of the spectrum, and the achievements are fairly easy to 100% so long as you keep a keen eye and make a new save during very efficiently telegraphed forks in the road (or you can just use a guide).\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2476893072\n\nDespite being in Early Access, this is a very well developed visual novel with high production value and a lot of things done right that you may not notice initially but is evident when you realize how immersed you are in your experience. My only knock against it, which is just straight up nitpicking, is that only two episodes are out and thus it's currently incomplete...but that's expressed upfront on the store page and is actually an indicator of how good the writing is that you just want more of the narrative and to see what happens next. The strictly chromatic shades were a great aesthetic choice given that it adds to the almost fairy tale tones that this story tends to weave in and out of, which is further emphasized by the fact that sometimes the visuals can look like anything from vivid paintings to more grounded black & white film photographs. There is certainly a level of mastery to the execution by the sum of Tiny Bunny's parts. I [b]highly recommend[/b] this title unless you're not the type of person who has the patience to wait out an episodic format or if you just like to start and finish something once it's complete, for which I don't blame you whatsoever, yet will recommend that you at least Wishlist and Follow the game for now then grab it when it hits its 1.0 build. My anticipation is high for the [b]Saikono[/b] team not only completing this visual novel, but also for whatever projects they'll be working on next since there is already a lot of potential there. Let's just hope they stick the landing with the full retail release of this one, no pressure.\n\n[quote=]Review copy provided by the developer to [b]Abyssal Ascent Reviews[/b] | [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32607787-Abyssal-Ascent/]Follow[/url] & [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/AbyssalAscent/]Join[/url] | Thanks!", "timestamp_created": 1620144290, "timestamp_updated": 1620168159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825349211692810059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91396329": {"recommendationid": "91396329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079106802", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 474, "last_played": 1655130246}, "language": "english", "review": "very amazing atmosphere", "timestamp_created": 1620106953, "timestamp_updated": 1620106953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91260170": {"recommendationid": "91260170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198997765958", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1685666787}, "language": "english", "review": "very cool game guys, very cool.

And it's not just because the Episode 4 is more shocking and provocative, no. I don't have a problem with that.\n\nThe problem is different. I have to face an unpleasant fact. Saikono cooperates with NialMak\u02bce company for the production of Tiny Bunny's merchandise. NialMak\u02bce, on the other hand, for some time releases 3D-printed figurines of... Givi, the \"national hero of the Donetsk People's Republic\".\n\nThat is, in the NialMak\u02bce store Alisa, Forest Master and other characters from Tiny Bunny side by side with a separatist. And, I'm quoting, \"a large part of the proceeds will go to humanitarian aid and to support special military operation\" aka Russian Invasion of Ukraine, the aggressor in the war in Ukraine.\n\nAll this information is publicly available, you can easily find it. I guess Saikono is well aware of that too.\n\nSo now I can't recommend to purchase Tiny Bunny. It's a pity that such bad things happen to really interesting and quality video games but supporting aggression against an independent nation is worse.\n\n--------ORIGINAL POSITIVE--------\nThis game is as good as \"Prologue\" that I've played before. Running \"TinyBunny.exe\" you open the thrilling story of an ordinary boy in Russian decorations of 1990s. By the way, it seems a great way to know more about our society of that time. Until all the other people living post-Soviet lives, our protagonist facing off against the terrible inexplicable things that would make your blood run cold. \"The owls are not what they seems\", as was said in \"Twin Peaks\".\n\n\"Tiny Bunny\" is brilliant in every way. Great art, wonderful music and well-written story are very impressive. Russian voice acting is a good addition to unusual, really special atmosphere of the visual novel. And only problem is... we have only two episodes! Can't wait to the rest of the story. So many mysteries, so many unanswered questions! I hope the success launch in early access will contribute to speedy releases of the following episodes.\n\nEven though I'm Russian, this review was written in English.
