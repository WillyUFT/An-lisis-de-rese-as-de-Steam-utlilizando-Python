What an amazing game made by Telltale Games. I loved the first part, and this, and both games made me cry. Some of the choices are really difficult to choose. I didn't know anything about The Walking Dead before playing this and the first part of the game. I am glad devs made this wonderful game. The graphics of the game are good, the story, music, characters-everything is amazing!\n\nWhile playing the first episode, the part where [spoiler]Clementine stitches her dog-bitten wound[/spoiler], I could literally feel that pain. After that scene, I was not feeling well. I felt like I had a vehicular accident and was feeling dizzy. Later, I went to sleep. Really, that scene was very powerful as well as disturbing too. I know it's just a game, but it left me speechless. I have seen many cruel and disturbing scenes in video games, but this was something else.\n\nThis is not just a game, it's a movie. I want to thank all the people who were involved in making this game, especially all the voice actors. They literally gave life to all the characters. This game made me want to watch The Walking Dead series.\nAbsolutely a 10/10 game.

game developed and published by Telltale Games.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nPlaying first Season is pretty much a requirement to play Season Two.\n\nSeason Two of The Walking Dead takes place shortly after events from first game.\nYou step into the shoes of Clementine, who after final occurrences in last episode in Season One, ventures together with Omid and Christa to shelter known as Wellington all the way up north, protecting from walkers due cold and layers of snow. Unfortunately Clem soon finds herself alone, having to utilize everything she was taught to survive, facing threat from undead and humans on her journey to reach safe haven.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nJust like previous season, S2 is a point-and-click adventure game where you control your character through a series of episodes, gameplay playing second fiddles to narrative and story.\nMost of the time is spend on selecting different dialogue options and in few moments, making important choices that affect the narrative, with consequences coming back later to bite you.\nWhen not chatting Walking Dead offers you an option to explore small sized areas. You can find and interact with items, pick them up and keep for later use, make a quick observation about them or chat with characters.\nGame has more than a few Quick Time Events to create intense action focused bits so be prepared for button mashing or quick selection of what to press with somewhat new \"Hold a mouse button and drag your mouse into specific direction\" to spice things up!\n\nAt the end of each episode you get a screen showing off your most important choices and how overall community picked to see if you are in majority or minority. Though I'm pretty sure with Telltale Games problems, servers are down so you have look at data from...some time period.\n\n[b]Playtime and replayability[/b]\nIt took me 8 hours to make my way through all episodes.\nYou can give game another go to check how different choices impact the narrative.\n\n[b]Pros and cons[/b]\nWithout any doubt my favourite and simply best part of S2 is Clementine and her development as season goes on. Following her journey as she finds herself once again between a rock and a hard place, with new group facing same issues she saw before, needing to adapt as constant threat from undead and other humans give them no rest is a real treat and strongest aspect of the game. Struggle, survival, sacrifice, tough decisions and betrayals, looming hope and despair on the horizon, constant tension, game has it all. One does have to roll eyes a bit when game is putting so much emphasis on a single child in groups with multiple adult characters, as Clementine will be send to do...literally everything, but that's just protagonist curse.\n\nSolid characters surrounding our heroine are as important to creating good narrative experience. Majority of them is well written, with variety of personalities clashing in to offer intense moments as Clem will have to find herself on some side of the barricade sooner or later.\nUnfortunately they still suffer from horror syndrome where not all actions make logical sense or just plain stupid deaths to push story forward exist, and there are characters who have rather weird, questionable motives which do bring down the quality of a game down a bit. Writing also has weaker moments in the middle of the season.\nAnd classic \"choices and consequences\" is a bit...iffy. I understand what they went with in 1st Season but in S2 choices feel even less impactful than before.\n\nThere is not much to be said about gameplay. It works with no problems, additional new \"mouse dragging\" mechanic to spice things up somewhat is a good move though, again, Walking Dead is not a game one plays for its exciting gameplay. Unfortunately game doesn't offer same amount of hub areas like first title, and that is by far biggest negative when it comes to this chunk of Season Two. \n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nWhile slightly dropping in quality in comparison to first season, fantastic atmosphere, great cast of characters with our protagonist on top and constant tension make Season Two worth playing. \n\nFeel free to check out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/] my curator page [/url] for more reviews!", "timestamp_created": 1699126050, "timestamp_updated": 1699126050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706766426563262939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149492891": {"recommendationid": "149492891", "author": {"steamid": "76561199234228324", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 535, "last_played": 1698289276}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1699076607, "timestamp_updated": 1699076607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149467078": {"recommendationid": "149467078", "author": {"steamid": "76561199053611119", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 543, "last_played": 1699042182}, "language": "spanish", "review": "lee i miss you...", "timestamp_created": 1699042242, "timestamp_updated": 1699042242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149465893": {"recommendationid": "149465893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083224607", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 731, "last_played": 1700369019}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1699040937, "timestamp_updated": 1699040937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149464959": {"recommendationid": "149464959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857840210", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 650, "last_played": 1699034637}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1699039821, "timestamp_updated": 1699039821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149439743": {"recommendationid": "149439743", "author": {"steamid": "76561199106834223", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1418, "last_played": 1699008843}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a 10/10, I love all seasons of The Walking Dead.

As we rejoin the story from the previous instalment, the stakes are even higher, creating an emotional rollercoaster that captivates players from start to finish.\n\nThe Walking Dead Season 2 is not just a game; it's a cinematic masterpiece that immerses players in a heart-wrenching narrative. The storytelling in this series continues to demonstrate the power of choice and consequence in a way that few games can match.\n\nThe characters you've grown attached to return, and your decisions impact their fates and the story's direction. This creates a sense of investment in the characters and their struggles that few games can achieve.\n\nAs the tension escalates, the game maintains its gripping narrative and appropriate soundtrack, providing an immersive experience that takes storytelling in games to new heights. Despite the undead apocalypse backdrop, it's the human elements, the relationships, and the choices that drive the narrative forward.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first season of The Walking Dead, Season 2 is a must-play continuation of the story. For those who appreciate profound storytelling, emotional depth, and memorable characters, this game is a gem in the gaming world.\n\nIn summary, The Walking Dead Season 2 is not just a game but a compelling journey that explores the depths of human emotion and the consequences of choice in a post-apocalyptic world.", "timestamp_created": 1698744189, "timestamp_updated": 1698744189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149240697": {"recommendationid": "149240697", "author": {"steamid": "76561199477018643", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 759, "last_played": 1698744517}, "language": "english", "review": "good game good story no bugs", "timestamp_created": 1698743029, "timestamp_updated": 1698743029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149219197": {"recommendationid": "149219197", "author": {"steamid": "76561199454364020", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1698703491}, "language": "english", "review": "jane>kenny", "timestamp_created": 1698703512, "timestamp_updated": 1698703512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149210493": {"recommendationid": "149210493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345182495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 592, "last_played": 1698692129}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1698692666, "timestamp_updated": 1698692666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149209047": {"recommendationid": "149209047", "author": {"steamid": "76561199527557381", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1698690685}, "language": "english", "review": "Its not as good as the first game, but if you like the first game, you will like the second one.", "timestamp_created": 1698691012, "timestamp_updated": 1698691012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149197427": {"recommendationid": "149197427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375460043", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1698677685}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not a game..

continuation of the critically acclaimed series, delivering another intense and emotionally charged adventure set in the post-apocalyptic world of the undead. The game's narrative is its strongest aspect, with a gripping storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The choices you make throughout the game truly matter, impacting the relationships you form with the characters and shaping the direction of the plot. The writing is top-notch, filled with poignant moments, unexpected twists, and moral dilemmas that force you to make tough decisions. The character development in season 2 is remarkable, especially when it comes to Clementine. As a young survivor, she faces numerous challenges and dangers, and it's fascinating to witness her growth and resilience as she navigates this harsh world. The supporting characters are also well-written and fleshed out, each with their own motivations and flaws. The gameplay mechanics remain similar to the season 1, with a focus on exploration, puzzle-solving, and decision-making.

INCLUIDOS]; esta vez tendr\u00e9 el honor de analizar una gran continuaci\u00f3n de una aventura gr\u00e1fica redonda: The Walking Dead: Temporada Dos.\nHe de decir que las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas/pel\u00edculas interactivas es mi g\u00e9nero favorito (tengo mis razones), y que me gust\u00f3 m\u00e1s la segunda temporada que la primera (oh dios m\u00edo eres un bicho raro.. Ejem, un respeto se\u00f1ores, todos tenemos algo raro en nuestra vida), ya sea porque empatic\u00e9 a\u00fan mejor con Clementine o porque en general el nuevo grupo me gust\u00f3 m\u00e1s (soy raro, lo s\u00e9). En fin, sin m\u00e1s dilaci\u00f3n, mi an\u00e1lisis.\n\nHISTORIA: The Walking Dead: Season Two es la continuaci\u00f3n directa de la primera temporada, que a su vez fue el juego que le di\u00f3 fama definitivamente a Telltale Games. La historia, a mi parecer (y el de la mayor\u00eda), es el punto m\u00e1s importante en una aventura gr\u00e1fica.\nContinuamos con las andaduras de Clementine, una ni\u00f1a que pierde al grupo en el que viajaba y que tambi\u00e9n pierde a su mayor amistad en el juego, Lee Everett. A partir de ese momento, Clementine tendr\u00e1 que viajar con otro grupo y reencontrarse con su antiguo compa\u00f1ero Kenny.\nUna historia que en algunos momentos not\u00e9 vac\u00eda, que le faltaba algo, que mor\u00edan los personajes porque as\u00ed lo quer\u00edan los desarrolladores. A\u00fan as\u00ed, me parece muy buena, y que hayan buenos juegos de zombies es bueno, bien porque hay muchos y empiezan a cansar o bien porque no innovan nada (ejem ejem Dead Island Riptide ejem ejem).\nLe doy 4/5 estrellas.\n\nJUGABILIDAD: Es una aventura gr\u00e1fica (Regreso al Futuro, The Wolf Among Us..), as\u00ed que no esperes \"aplastar botones\".\nEs un juego generalmente pausado, con un ritmo digno de TWD, donde conocer y entablar amistad con los personajes y sobrevivir es lo importante. Aunque eso no quita que haya muchos momentos en los que correr \"a toda hostia\" con el botoncito. Las decisiones son variadas y los momentos en que escoger \"decisiones importantes\" est\u00e1n bien elegidos (aunque odio que un personaje muera s\u00ed o s\u00ed, pero qu\u00e9 se le har\u00e1...).\nLe doy 5/5 estrellas.\n\nGR\u00c1FICOS: Es una aventura gr\u00e1fica con un apartado gr\u00e1fico m\u00e1s que excelente, que no busca (ni de lejos) la \"foto-realidad\" pero que no cojea en las expresiones faciales y el aspecto de los personajes y el entorno; aunque he de quejarme de esas animaciones rob\u00f3ticas, no me gustaron para nada. Aparte, tiene un apartado art\u00edstico muy bueno y que encaja a la perfecci\u00f3n con la tem\u00e1tica Zombie.\nLe doy 4.5/5 estrellas.\n\nSONIDO: Me pareci\u00f3 correcto, bien localizado en los momentos exactos, pero me pareci\u00f3 mejor la de la primera temporada. A\u00fan as\u00ed, sigue siendo correcta.\nLe doy 4/5 estrellas.\n\nINNOVACI\u00d3N: El apartado pol\u00e9mico, el apartado del c\u00e1ncer, el apartado de la baja nota... Ll\u00e1malo como quieras. Total decepci\u00f3n, as\u00ed describo este apartado. Ninguna evoluci\u00f3n respecto a la primera temporada, es exactamente lo mismo. No pido que saquen lo m\u00e1s de lo m\u00e1s, pero macho, tela. A pesar de todo, todo lo aplicado en la primera temporada aqu\u00ed sigue siendo excelente, y esto es lo que salva este apartado.\nLe doy 2.5/5 estrellas.\n\nNOTA FINAL: 20.5/25 estrellas = 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1696042434, "timestamp_updated": 1696042434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147322712": {"recommendationid": "147322712", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228826743", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1676231578}, "language": "english", "review": "still not bitten", "timestamp_created": 1696040020, "timestamp_updated": 1696040020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147317241": {"recommendationid": "147317241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873379031", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 679, "last_played": 1696032210}, "language": "english", "review": "fuck arvo all my homies hate arvo", "timestamp_created": 1696032431, "timestamp_updated": 1696032431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147308110": {"recommendationid": "147308110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838933753", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 749, "last_played": 1695995295}, "language": "english", "review": "A big step back in almost every aspect from the original game.\n\nFor the most part I am angry at those writers, who are due to their stupidity does not now what a harsh season winter is for human beings.

Luke era joven, fuerte y valiente, pero por eso mismo comet\u00eda errores y era imprudente. Sarah fue salvada tanto para morir de una forma que creo fue est\u00fapida, y la misteriosa conclusi\u00f3n del resto del grupo me disgust\u00f3 (peca de que, como el juego anterior, los personajes pecan de cometer muchos errores siendo que ya llevaban como 5 a\u00f1os en el apocalipsis)\n\nEl juego busca hacerte sentir mal en todo momento para que sepas que tu decisi\u00f3n fue tuya y afectar\u00e1 de todas formas a la historia.

This, in itself, is not a bad thing to explore, in fact I think it's quite interesting, however the game treats Clem leaving with Kenny as the 'good ending' - and makes his death bittersweet if you choose to kill him. Jane, who is at odds with Kenny, does not receive this treatment and is in comparison a far better role model for Clementine. It seems cheap - like Telltale was trying to illicit an emotional response based on the fact that we *know* Kenny. I don't buy it. [/spoiler] The new cast isn't anything special either.

Dentro rese\u00f1a!\n\n\nPoint and click que sigue a su antecesor siendo esta vez Clementine la protagonista con el legado que Lee le dej\u00f3. Ahora, algo m\u00e1s adulta debe seguir avanzando y sobreviviendo a todo tipo de situaciones.  Poca innovaci\u00f3n, las mismas mec\u00e1nicas donde el eje principal se basa en las decisiones que tomamos y las que llevar\u00e1n a un camino u otro con muertes de personajes o salv\u00e1ndolos.\n\nA d\u00eda de hoy se sigue conservando bien en todos los aspectos y aunque para muchos fue el cierre de la historia, continuar\u00e1 en otras dos temporadas de las que ya hablaremos. Un cierre perfecto durante los 5 episodios (~2 horas cada uno).  Las situaciones si bien algunas son parecidas a las del anterior juego, innova en localizaciones y personajes, donde odiar\u00e1s a unos y amar\u00e1s a otros. Es la segunda vez que lo juego y no ha bajado la calidad con la que lo recuerdo.\n\nEn fin si simplemente os gustan las buenas historias deber\u00edais jugar a todas las temporadas de TWD.

developed. What I found interesting at the start is that once you start a \"New Game\" it will search your PC for a save file from the first game, where all of your choices are stored. I haven't seen it in story games before as far as the story games I played. \nIn this game you will see the second part of the series where you continue the story. It hit my heart evenly emotionally as the first game (Maybe a little more). You'll have to make very difficult choices through the game that will impact the outcome as bad as they could be. \nOverall I would recommend it as it puts a whole new perspective onto the first game.

forgotten by the rest of the survivors(such as the deaths of Walter, Carlos,Sarah and Luke)\n\nEverything else about the game was phenomenal, The ending that i chose (staying with Kenny the whole way

from Telltale was almost perfect but it just wasn't and let me explain to you why. \nFirst in terms of duration the game feels short compared to the previous title which even had a DLC that was so cool, this doesn't mean that is bad, it's more like they rushed the production after the success of the first one.\nThat leads me to the other issue I encounter, and it has to be with some choices that won't really affect the outcome of certain situations I mean it has happened before but I really expected an improvement, that was what we all liked of this series it's like they're just caring less about the structure of the story and giving more credit to just putting on some graphical situations and maybe they could've release some DLC about of things were in the Supermarket just after the 400 Days DLC ended that would've be awesome.\nAnyways, despite all of this I found the game entertaining enough and it's very enjoyable specially if you come from the previous title and want to continue the story, beautiful scenarios and memorable characters definitely a must-play and another point to graphical novels.", "timestamp_created": 1692674005, "timestamp_updated": 1692674005,

The dialogue box change was nice, but it is clear the selection buttons were designed with console in mind as it works great for joysticks. But for us PC players it can be more annoying than using the scroll wheel as we did in the previous game. \n\nSecondly, the story is very meh. Very little of what you do actually matters. Which is a problem for the entire Telltale series, but in this season it is by-far the worst. You will save characters only for them to die 20 minutes later, sometimes in the exact same episode. Several character development attempts go absolutely nowhere and characters are forgotten by other characters shortly after their dramatic death scenes. Characters also feel rushed, with them changing their personality frequently.\n\nClementine is an awesome character but making her the protagonist at only 11 years old really limited what the player could do compared to Lee in the previous game. There was very little of the dramatic choices or action scenes seen in the first season.\n\nThis season also fails to take into consideration a lot of what happened in the previous season. Despite the option to use save data from the previous season, this is only used in a few dialogue options in the first episode this season. The game assumes that your version of Lee went down the path of being a saint, with disregard if the player made hostile or bad choices throughout their time playing season 1.\n\nIf you're desperate for more of the TWD, this game might satisfy that urge. Otherwise, you'll probably enjoy Season 1 or Season 3-4 better than this one.", "timestamp_created": 1688939146, "timestamp_updated": 1688939146, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

The second season of The Walking Dead is a real kaleidoscope of failures, in spite of which the characters survive and increasingly lose their moral compass. After the woeful first season, which, however, inspired optimism, the second is seen as a standard of despair and despondency. Even when the heroes finally find their target - what do they do? They wallow in internal strife and firmly, greedily hold on to their vices. Kenny - the embodiment of responsibility - developed much more complicated, much brighter than the central character Clementine. In the first season, he lost everything and has now turned from a determined flowering man into an indifferent, grief-stricken figure who has lost the meaning of life. He has become cruel, rude, harsh and demands complete submission, because he knows better how to save your troubled asses. On the opposite side, there is the concept of independence, which acquires new facets of meaning in the dead world. The lively girl Jane is the personification of freedom. Jane experienced a lot, lost her sister, but she learned a lesson from her troubles completely different from other heroes. The key to survival is loneliness, partners are a burden that pulls you to the bottom, and any group is doomed to collapse and death. This confrontation in the second season was key. Mutual assistance, disastrous heroism and the mythical walled city of Wellington, a guiding star for Kenny and his rare supporters, on the one hand, and bitter freedom from responsibility, on the other.

He became a complete monster and it was really sad. \n*[spoiler]Kenny vs Jane is a tough decision. I personally chose Kenny but he's pretty fucked too.[/spoiler]\n*Edgy/aggressive dialogue options are incredibly entertaining.\n\nCONS: \n*Your choices are one sided and there is usually a better one. (they hold no weight unlike in s1 where they each affected the game in little ways)\n*Dialogue options barely affect your relationships with characters. Being an asshole or saint doesn't matter because the characters forget a minute later.\n*Carver is a generic power dynamic villain\n*The adults make Clementine do the adult work which makes sense from a game play perspective but its really dumb.\n*There is almost no downtime to just talk to the characters and get to know them. Fast paced set piece to set piece.\n*Characters are killed off without finishing their arcs which is super unsatisfying. (they had the potential to be great but it was squandered)\n*Barely any branching dialogue options compared to Season 1\n*Saving characters doesn't matter because they don't have any redemption or development afterwards. (unlike Ben from season 1)\n*Christa is M.I.A. (she never appears again in season 3 or 4)\n*Bad implementation of 400 Days by giving the characters brief cameos (400 Days was supposed to be the bridge between season 1 and 2)\n*Much more of an on rails experience than season 1. Its like one long interactive cut scene unlike s1 which gave you downtime and optional dialogue.\n\nI would only recommend it on sale just to see how the story continues. You might really like it. You could also watch a play through from your favorite youtuber. \n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1682547082, "timestamp_updated": 1699669055, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498098880052566528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137317375": {"recommendationid": "137317375", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096669889", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 218, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 758, "last_played": 1682507628}, "language": "english", "review": "The Walking Dead: Season Two review\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros:\n+Story-driven game\n+Amazingly well-written\n+Intense scenes\n+Badass Clem is amazing\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons:\n-Get ready to cry, a lot, AGAIN\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo I recommend The Walking Dead: Season Two?\nYes", "timestamp_created": 1682507717, "timestamp_updated": 1682507717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137201906": {"recommendationid": "137201906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882396435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 667, "last_played": 1682293043}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game", "timestamp_created": 1682292714, "timestamp_updated": 1682292714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137181088": {"recommendationid": "137181088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345565635", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4102, "last_played": 1621294326}, "language": "english", "review": "Love!

I would still consider S1 the better overall season as that gave choices more impact and a tight story.\nThis gets a little sloppy. \nEpisode 1 is a decent start with some good moments, but I think it trailed off a bit too much for its own good.\nEpisode 2 is better since we have a main cast now, but the number quickly rises. There are a lot of moving parts and it goes back to an earlier plot point and has it as a cliffhanger.\nEpisode 3 is my personal favorite. It is tight and has some great scenes overall. I was finally getting used to the main cast of characters and they were being used in the right ways.\nEpisode 4 is not bad at all and has some good theme progression. It is also the big episode that establishes something that will be used for the rest of the franchise. \nEpisode 5 is okay. It has decent tension but I really felt the absence of the main cast. Too many were killed off and I think there could've been something more for them. The final choice is tough... especially when two of the obvious ones don't feel right. *obv i won't mention who exactly got killed but this is Walking dead. we all know people are gonna die.\n\nI think what gets me here is how dark the story actually is. It is used well in some areas and not in others. It went for something a little different.

The choices you make as Clementine will have you second-guessing yourself like a survivor second-guessing a shortcut through a zombie-infested alleyway.\n\nAnd let's not forget the characters.

You will be thinking, \"that was interesting how will this character grow from this, will they start causing problems for the group, are they going to grow and learn, never mind move the story along they're dead.\"\n\nThroughout the first season you always had Lee and Clementine and could see how they grew as characters and how their relationship changed over time. In this you frequently have characters not around in certain episodes, join late, or leave. Characters are said to possess certain traits that you don't really see, and get killed off instead of finishing any kind of story arc. In the first game you had Lee's relationship with Clementine, Lee trying to earn the groups trust, Clementine trying to find her parents, Ben feeling guilty over his actions leading to the death of people, Kenny forgiving Ben. Important characters from the first season are quickly removed from the game and even after years of zombies being around the characters you are with and more incompetent than ever. Characters from the 400 Days DLC are only given a short possible cameo with the exception of one. Choices still don't really mean anything, now amounting to little more than keeping an uninteresting character alive a little longer only to have them almost immediately killed off in a scene or killed off screen. \n\nThe focus tries to be Clementine and what living in a world like this could turn her into, even having the cliche badly written moment of random villain you hardly know saying that you are just like him, even though you might not have ever done anything for that to even make sense. You also never end up needing to make any kind of difficult decisions that you could see causing Clementine to turn into a more harsh or violent person, making the central focus of the story often non existent. The final chapter is terrible, starting like an old serial film that seems to ignore the last chapters ending where pretty much everyone should have been dead, characters start to ignore or barely be effected by being shot, and choosing one of the two endings, pairs you with an extremely abusive person, and undoes a character arc of the previous season and ends up leading to a pretty ridiculous fairy tale seeming situation which would seem to be telling people that hanging out with violent controlling abusive people is good actually (which will be undone in as ridiculous a fashion as any other ending you get in the next season opening anyway). Zombies are also supposed to be slowed down by the cold but seem to function very well after being trapped under the ice of a frozen lake. It ends up being a much more uninteresting generic zombie story full of bad cliches than the first season with some horrible and somewhat offensive use of certain characters.", "timestamp_created": 1675389890, "timestamp_updated": 1679906982, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538461565971374512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132091783": {"recommendationid": "132091783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198960428324", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1675890610}, "language": "english", "review": "The best BUT play season 1 first", "timestamp_created": 1675379952, "timestamp_updated": 1675379952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132083835": {"recommendationid": "132083835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257180496", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1644789502}, "language": "english", "review": "The game does not have the Spanish language", "timestamp_created": 1675369571, "timestamp_updated": 1675369571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132071928": {"recommendationid": "132071928", "author": {"steamid": "76561199276054957", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1689785512}, "language": "english", "review": "very super giga mega cool game :D", "timestamp_created": 1675355713, "timestamp_updated": 1675355713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132071511": {"recommendationid": "132071511", "author": {"steamid": "76561199435924979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1682538810}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really cool and clem is da best!!!", "timestamp_created": 1675355237, "timestamp_updated": 1675355237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132042820": {"recommendationid": "132042820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128273884", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 558, "last_played": 1675375414}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing", "timestamp_created": 1675312753, "timestamp_updated": 1675312753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132017028": {"recommendationid": "132017028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198966001434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 653, "last_played": 1675275697}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tremendamente buena....

Follows the first one, a mix of point and click with some scenes with a bit more of action (probably more than the first). Good story. \n\nOn Steam Deck:\n- Running fine to the day of the review (will edit if I notice anything odd)\n- Some blocky shadows that black out parts of the screen. Tried applying Proton GE (7.47 at the moment) and added \"-noblur\" (withou the \"\") on the launch parameters and haven't seen them again, hope it fixed it and not just a coincidence. \n- Changed the resolution to 1280x800 (too fill up the screen) manually since the game started with a lower one and didn't changed automaticaly.\n- Players that played Season One can load the save to keep their previous choices, the problem is that doesn't work on the Deck/Linux. If you don't have any other computer, there's a linux tutorial somewhere to help you with at (don't remember where, but probably you can easily find it on google). Easier way, get your hands on a win computer (or VM on a Mac since the newer Macs won't run these 32bit games), then open Season One (so it fetches the save from Steam Cloud), exit, and then opened Season Two, made it look for the Season One save, let the game start and exit. It will load the save to Steam Cloud and then you can continue on the Deck.", "timestamp_created": 1674658686, "timestamp_updated": 1675075334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131515016": {"recommendationid": "131515016", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215876352", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1674624226}, "language": "english", "review": "Kenny our lord and savior.", "timestamp_created": 1674639864, "timestamp_updated": 1675668671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131508628": {"recommendationid": "131508628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023456092", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 600, "last_played": 1674554184}, "language": "english", "review": "Just as good as the first game!

It tells yet another great story, lets you bond with the characters and is overall a work of art. I still think the first game was better in terms of story, but that did not change the fact that I enjoyed this one immensely. \n\nThe Walking Dead: Season Two is the direct sequel to the first The Walking Dead game. It picks up where the first game ended and continues with Clementine as the main protagonist.\n\nThe story is a piece of perfection and, just like the first The Walking Dead review, I will not spoil anything. This is something that you need to experience for yourself.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this game is that it can import your choices and outcomes from the first game, including the 400 Days DLC. People react to you based on the choices you made from the original The Walking Dead. So epic. \nGraphicly, The Walking Dead: Season Two received a nice upgrade. Besides the improved cell shading and animations, the game is a lot darker, something that enhanced the experience really well. The sky is dusk yellow most of the time, giving you the feeling of an apocalypse wasteland.\n\nThe sound design is just as good as the first game, especially the voice acting of all the characters. It is the sound where Telltale games shines the most. This shows with the soundtrack, which is excellent. It even got nominated for several rewards. You know that you are doing it right when you achieve that level. \n\nThe Walking Dead: Season Two plays in the same style as the original game in which you use point and click mechanics, quick time events and choice making to work to the ultimate ending of the game. Every choice has consequences, and, at times, real moral dilemmas are present in which both options are technically wrong or unfair, but you have to make a choice. \n\nYou need to react fast at times and are not always giving the opportunity to think things through. This aspect of quick reaction is realistic and if you make a mistake in game by providing a wrong answer or an answer that people are not happy about, it is just like real life, in which you do not have the perfect response or solution available right away.\n\nOriginally, just like The Wolf Among Us, new episodes would come out every few months between each other. But, just like The Wolf Among Us, you can also buy the retail version, including all the episodes. \n\nThe episodes themselves are great, every one of them and the overall length of the game and the episodes themselves is fair. You got a solid seventeen hours of story ahead of you when playing the game, which is very acceptable for just a story based, on rail point and click game.\n\nLike I said, I would prefer the first game over this one, but this is my personal taste. I think this is mainly because of my attachment to Lee from the first game. \n\nOverall, I loved The Walking Dead: Season Two and, once again, Telltale Games earned my deepest respect for creating this beautiful game. \n\nAbsolutely recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1674162982, "timestamp_updated": 1674162982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131165274": {"recommendationid": "131165274", "author": {"steamid": "76561199240725028", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 560, "last_played": 1674158672}, "language": "spanish", "review": "literalmente me qued\u00e9 \" \u00b70\u00b7 \" en el \u00faltimo episodio, recomendad\u00edsimo \n( kenny te quiero )", "timestamp_created": 1674158868, "timestamp_updated": 1674158868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131163264": {"recommendationid": "131163264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198975472898", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1674155401}, "language": "english", "review": "whats not there to like about this game?", "timestamp_created": 1674156290, "timestamp_updated": 1674156290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131158082": {"recommendationid": "131158082", "author": {"steamid": "76561199350143872", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 944, "last_played": 1674149737}, "language": "english", "review": "my fav game now\n", "timestamp_created": 1674149754, "timestamp_updated": 1674149754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131121646": {"recommendationid": "131121646", "author": {"steamid": "76561199145974898", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1248, "last_played": 1687733934}, "language": "english", "review": "jhgkb", "timestamp_created": 1674096039, "timestamp_updated": 1674096039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131114271": {"recommendationid": "131114271", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096378119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1674083134}, "language": "english", "review": "Ive had my eye on this game since i was a little kid and i finally was able to play it.

It allows you to take control of Clementine, the girl you took care of in the first game and decide what type of person she will become. \n\nThe games biggest weakness and strength is one character is [spoiler] Kenny, this is because his story wrapped up perfectly in the first game (if you saved Ben), it even concludes with his death. But now he's back and his anger is a lot worse. He is the main conflict of the game, whether you side with him or not, and that can be difficult when sometimes he's mad at you no matter what choice you make. [/spoiler]\n\nThere was a interesting idea with having a couple characters have two possible deaths, depending on your choices. But the idea falls flat. [spoiler] Nick can be killed by Walter which is interesting and makes narrative sense, due to his prior actions, or he can die off-screen and be found as a zombie, which is so disappointing. The second character I know of with this mechanic is Sarah, who can be killed after being too afraid to do something. Bringing the arc of her being Clem could've been without Lee to a close. Showing us that people need to be strong to survive now. Or she can fall off a balcony and get eaten because there's nothing you can do, and you get no chance of saving her yourself. It really sucks, but I think it would've been better off leaving that mechanic out if they weren't willing to actually change the story.

Otherwise you're forced to shut up, let everyone else remain a dumb fuck, and end tragically because you didn't say shit earlier.\n\n\n[spoiler] You could decide whether to rob Arvo or not, and I decided not to. He came back saying we robbed him and took his supplies, THERE WAS NO FUCKING DIALOGUE HE'S LYING. The only thing thats somewhat similar to it is BLAMING JANE like he took anything from him... well yeah she took his revolver and thats it, would it make sense to kill each other over a fucking revolver? And as for the rest of the game everyone including me are supposed to feel bad for arvo when we defeated his guys. How could I feel sympathy for a man who intended to KILL ME over a FUCKING REVOLVER? I supported Kenny all the way saying that kid deserves the beating, we would be dead otherwise if we wouldn't be able to fight them back. What? I'm evil? Did the kid not count with the consequences? He just gets to go around town killing people and if that turns out wrong we shall show sympathy and let him be? Kenny wasn't crazy, but the game and characters made it look like he is. Frustrated the hell out of me. So to conclude, I couldnt speak up and prove him wrong, everyone is acting like an idiot because of this and feeling sorry for him, Kenny is labeled as crazy for giving him what he deserved. And the entire group just fucking split by the end because this misunderstanding of Kenny. If they could just give me ONE TIME to tell the entire group the FUCKING TRUTH, I wouldn't be mad, I'd just get over it saying everyone is dumb as rock and being ignorant.

everything they changed about it during the process, it's very well written. well, literally every season of this game series is perfect, very well written and the best I know compared to any other game, so basically, the worst season of this series, is still better than any other game from any other series, for me. I'm not saying this season is the worst among all though. \n\nthis season of the game affects the other seasons of the game series the most, but playing the first season before this is still a must.

It tells the story from Clementine's point of view who tries to survive the upcoming winter with a new group.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Story branchings that lead to different endings\n- You can transfer your decisions from the first game\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- No manual save option\n\n[b]Specs[/b]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you liked the first game, buy this game.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe game still uses the same unique style as the first season. Characters look like 2D portraits with their black lines on their models, while the environments take a more realistic look. I also liked how the grasses and plants look so detailed. The fire doesn't seem to match the environment, though - they look like lights more than anything.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story tells a few years after the events in the first season. Clementine has learned more about how to survive in the apocalypse and become more mature with time. This makes her character looks cold most of the time - her eyes are squinted instead of wide when this happens to make it more apparent. Although she has to mature quicker than her age, she still can be gentle depending on the decision that you chose.\n\nChoice matters for the story. Some dialogues only differ in the first few responses after your choice, but others will slightly impact the story sometime in the future. The most major changes will be the characters' deaths, which just like the first season, mostly won't matter since the character that won't die in one choice will either be gone or dead later on. I still think that's understandable since it can be hard to make a sequel with a lot of branching paths.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=971751160\n\nThe main topic of this season is trust. You'll be presented with a new group that you will get along with, but unlike the first season, it can be hard to trust people at this time - years have passed after the apocalypse starts. People already flocked around to make groups and they have information that you don't. You'll be left in the dark for some time and have to choose without knowing everything. This also put your loyalty to the test. With a group being as secretive as it is, can you trust them? Or should you ditch them and choose the other side? The pattern will keep on happening until you have to choose between people.\n\nBeing in an apocalypse for years, you might think that people are capable. The new people that she met were mostly useless; they might be able to fend themselves from the zombies, but they are not in the right mind. Most of the cast are mentally unstable, and they keep on arguing most of the time. Moreover, when push comes to shove, they will mostly have no choice but to rely on Clem, which has to do either emotional support or heavy lifting for the group.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2714764904\n\nStill, some emotions are going through the game. It's not as impactful as how it was in the first season, but I don't mind since the pacing was faster this season. You will understand the tension and why people are feeling that way: the despair, the anger, the desperation - all of it can be felt from each of the characters. Sometimes, I even can't choose between the choices since I couldn't find a better way out of it.\n\nAs for the ending, it might not be as emotional and touching as the first one, but it was made brief. You get a scene, and bam - the game suddenly ends. There is no time for you to get closure or anything, which might be done in purpose for the sequel. Still, I enjoyed the story. I had to stop and think for a while about whether I made the right choice at that time. It felt like I was drawn to the tension in the story. The sudden decision at the intense moment near the end might have contributed to that, and I liked it for what it is.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]The Walking Dead: Season Two[/b] doesn't have much in the gameplay department. Sometimes, the game will let you walk around, interact with objects, and talk to people, but they are mostly brief.\n\nMost of the gameplay comes in the QTE section. They are usually the same ones like mashing the Q button or pressing an arrow button, although there are more complicated ones too. Still, you can retry them if you fail and they are easy enough to finish as long as you're paying attention and/or remembering which button to press.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=204876213\n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 10.2h. The game was split into 5 chapters, meaning that each chapter lasts for ~2h. People can replay the game to have a different ending. However, since most choices at the beginning won't have much impact on the ending, I don't think replaying the game is a good idea, especially since you can't skip the cutscenes.\n\nIf you have played the first game (which you should), you can import your save to this game. Your decision will carry over to the rest of the game, although as I said before, they won't matter much. You also can have the game generate the choices if you don't have your save anymore.\n\n[b]Issues[/b]\nThere is no manual save option. The game might tell when it does the saving, but sometimes the checkpoints can be far from each other. Moreover, there are no skip cutscene options. It can take time to replay the game to see the different endings this way.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[b]The Walking Dead: Season Two[/b] might be less impactful than the first season, but it's still an enjoyable game. The gameplay is mostly the same with a focus on the story. I was hooked on it from the start until the end, and sometimes, my head even hurt thinking from all of the arguments. There are a lot of heated discussions going on, and people are at their limits. It's nice to see a different side of the apocalypse with the arguing and bashing, and if you already played and enjoyed the first game, I don't see a reason to not play this one, unless you are already stressed out and don't want to see people arguing when playing a game.", "timestamp_created": 1669180761, "timestamp_updated": 1669181042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681478023529052734", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126101185": {"recommendationid": "126101185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260243039", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 693, "last_played": 1669834298}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1669160532, "timestamp_updated": 1669160532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126031337": {"recommendationid": "126031337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023776379", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 395, "last_played": 1669243669}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1669149449, "timestamp_updated": 1669149449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125937519": {"recommendationid": "125937519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805175411", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 959, "last_played": 1669137167}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game for the build up of Clem character, The most realistic scene i loved when the dog tried to attack Clem when she feed him, Dogs aren't really your best friend and in dire times their true nature will surface and eventually hurt you.

(Just kidding, [b]abajo dejo la rese\u00f1a en espa\u00f1ol[/b]).\n\nI was thinking in recommending buying the collecting instead, but I see that game had a lot of visual bugs for no reason, so I\u2019m not sure anymore.\n\nGood thing my save file was finded easily starting a new game without much worries and also taking my choices made in 400 Days DLC, thing what Dragon Age 2 doesn\u2019t do with Dragon Age: Awakening, I mean, is good to see a SME. (Because it\u2019s not indie at all).\n\nDude, I really want to play Telltale's The Walking Dead without knowing my choices doesn\u2019t matter, at least the story is decent.\n\nBy the way, why not a skip option for credits or \"previously\" recap?\n\nThe episode 3\u2026 Oh my god what a mess. I knew my choices don\u2019t matter, but saying there \u201call characters in 400 days will play a role in season 2 of TWD.\u201d And then, each one just make a ten seconds cameo is such a cheap move.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLvN1pP3ZB4\n\nWhat is this bullshit? The only interesting thing is seeing all those characters being henchman of a crazy leader who things killing people is a way of\u2026 showing we must to take hard decision? I don\u2019t know, killing a one-hand person\u2026 It is not so much difficulty, more like bullying.\n\nThey can made a 800 days showing how they get there and how they become cynical and by the way; Expanding your poorly written villain.\n\nThe zombies are a little bit more detailed, so I think is a good thing.\n\nI give this game a negative review because it can be a lot better. Also, the franchise is always the same, you find a group, you move, you feel safe, then a person betray or become crazy and you need to move again, everybody die and you find another group for repeat the cycle.\nIt\u2019s a decent game, and had some interesting things, like Sarah, because as well of Ben, is possible the most common person you will find in a zombie apocalypse, before Lee or Clementine.\n\nA decent game, but with lots of flaws\n\n\n[h1]Espa\u00f1ol:[/h1]\nEste juego esta solo en ingl\u00e9s, cosa que es una poronga para muchas personas, pero m\u00e1s teniendo en cuenta que el anterior juego si ten\u00eda traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol.\nEstaba por recomendar la colecci\u00f3n completa, pero vi que tiene tantos bugs visuales que ahora no estoy del todo seguro.\n\nLo bueno es que mi partida guardada fue encontrada sin necesidad de bajarme de nuevo el TWD, incluyendo con lo del DLC de 400 d\u00edas, destaco esto porque Dragon Age 2 me trajo problemas con Dragon Age: Awakening y eso que a comparaci\u00f3n de EA, Telltale Games es una PYME. (Tampoco puedo decir que son indie).\nAunque bueno, Dragon Age S\u00cd tiene personajes que pueden sobrevivir hasta el final o morir en la primera entrega as\u00ed que hay tambi\u00e9n algo bueno por parte de Bioware que Telltale Games no hizo.\n\nMe gustar\u00eda jugar este juego con una mentalidad m\u00e1s inocente, creyendo que mis decisiones importan. Pero esa magia no volver\u00e1 m\u00e1s luego de la primera temporada.\n\nAdem\u00e1s \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se pueden saltear los cr\u00e9ditos y el \u00abpreviamente en The Walking Dead\u00bb?\n\nEl episodio 3 de esta temporada\u2026 Dios, un desastre. Ya s\u00e9 que mis decisiones no importan, pero decir que los personajes van a tomar un rol importante y solo hacen un cameo de 10 segundos me parece imperdonable.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLvN1pP3ZB4 \nEn serio \u00bfQu\u00e9 es esta poronga? Lo \u00fanico curioso es ver todos estos personajes convertidos en tropas de un tipo que posta se cree su mierda de la supervivencia del m\u00e1s apto, mientras mata a gente con un solo brazo que le tiene respeto y luego miedo.\n\nPod\u00edan haber hecho un DLC de 800 d\u00edas, continuar con sus historias y de paso desarrollar a su villano pobremente implementado.\n\nLos zombis est\u00e1n mas detallados en esta entrega, supongo que es algo bueno.\n\nLe doy rese\u00f1a negativa porque la verdad es que esta muy flojo todo, una cosa es que tus decisiones no importen y otra cosa es cometer los mismos errores de la serie y hacer siempre lo mismo, mueren todos, buscas un grupo, se complica, se mueven, cuando parece que est\u00e1n seguro, una persona es malo, as\u00ed hasta el infinito.\n\nDentro de todo, es una secuela decente, con cosas que la gente odia pero puedo entender que est\u00e9n ah\u00ed, como Sarah, que al igual que Ben, refleja que antes que gente como Lee o Clementine, te vas a encontrar con gente guiada por el miedo que por otra cosa.", "timestamp_created": 1667790031, "timestamp_updated": 1681419816, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125060618": {"recommendationid": "125060618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104512389", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 527, "last_played": 1667719920}, "language": "english", "review": "\"hey, who left this bowl of onions here?\"", "timestamp_created": 1667757009, "timestamp_updated": 1667757009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125041005": {"recommendationid": "125041005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814512162", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 525, "last_played": 1664490863}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely loved this series!

and the russians.Loved Kenny,Luke and Alvin...from the beginning I hated Rebecca but after a while I started liking her,after she apologized for how she treated us.I really hated Carlos and the main reason for that is because he's supposed to be a doctor.A doctor can identify a dog bite and a walker bite.But no,this motherfucker said ''Sorry we can't be sure,that's why we will lock u in the shed'' I loved how Clementine kept reminding these guys for how they treated her when she needed help.I didn't really like Jane.Mike and Bonnie,never trusted them at all,especially Bonnie and Jane,mainly because:Jane has a habbit of manipulating and leaving people behind,and Bonnie,because she ratted us out to Carver.Mike,well because he wanted to leave with the motherfucker Arvo.The character I hate the most is Arvo,this motherfucker literally blamed us for robbing him (even though in my first playthrough I didn't) he still blamed us! And even after that,he shot us for no reason whatsoever,even when I was nice to him when Kenny was beating him up.I really hope Arvo fucking turns into a walker.Telltale did a really great job at making likeable characters and hateable characters.Oh,I forgot Sarita and Sarah,I hated Sarah,she was annoying as fuck.Sarita,well I really didn't give two shits about her lmao.Also,fuck Nick.\n\nOverall,if you wanna know what happened after season 1,that's a pretty good sequel well worth the money.\n\n\nAnother spoiler:\n\ntake the medicine from Arvo,because he will blame you no matter what you did.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1665091915, "timestamp_updated": 1665092504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

Clementine has gone from cute, innocent girl to protect into a much more somber old-for-her-age eleven year-old (which is bittersweet, no matter how you slice it).  Ultimately, as this game gets further along, you realize it is addressing the abuse cycle and how people act when they are stuck in it and IF they try to break free.  You get a real sense of how broken the apocalypse would make some people.\n\nMajor changes from the first game are the lack of commentary from the player character whenever they look at objects (minor you'd think, but it really adds a sense of melancholy mood throughout the game).  Choices seem a lot more punishing and tend to lead to bad outcomes no matter how you slice them.  Tons of \"what traumatic situation can we force this little girl into next\" vibes in order to beat the player with how harsh and sad this world is for our main character to experience.  Overall, the gameplay is generally identical to the first one with a minor new mechanic or two that are well-explained.\n\nThe most glaring issue I'd say with making Clementine the main protagonist this time around is the fact that yes, she is still just an eleven year-old child.  Unlike Lee in the first game, when you make choices and speak up quite constantly (obviously as the player character)....people wouldn't listen to you all the time.  Adults make calls (especially in life-or-death survival), not children.  So that tends to break immersion if you really think about how Clem's choices would truly affect the groups she finds herself in.  This is simply an unfortunate consequence of the setup.\n\nSome emotionally satisfying moments and some very warm callbacks to the first season help this round as you struggle along in survival.  Lots of characters get picked off and force the player to wonder if they should emotionally detach from everyone like some of the characters you meet have already done to ensure their survival.\n\nAll in all, not as fresh and memorable as Season 1 will remain to be, but a competent sequel if you are captured by the story narrative of Clementine as it continues to play out.

That was disappointing as i liked these open areas. This game still had some of these open areas, but they were usually more linear, not much to talk about with the characters there, less interact-ables, and generally you went through them quicker. That could have been for the games more on the move style, where we were always on the move unlike the first game, and that added generally more action to the game, in turn adding more quick time events, which were quite improved on, adding more controls to use, and were much more natural and dynamic. \nOther minor gameplay elements were added too, especially during action scenes, like the added amount of times you actually shoot weapons, with proper aiming this time, and the new click and hold to a direction feature.\n\nThe visuals, preserving the first game's comic book style, were very well improved on. \nI criticized the first game for having inconsistencies in terms of some really nice looking scenes with sharp textures, but some areas with blurry low res textures. In this game this was almost completely fixed with sharp textures all across the game. The farther backdrops were improved too, being more layered, instead of just being a 2D wall like the first game. The lighting seen some good changes too. \nThis game was just generally much more visually polished and consistent which was very appreciated.\n\nThis game, while not expanding on my most fun aspect of exploring small open areas every now and then, was still a great game with a phenomenal story, relatively good enough gameplay, and improved visuals.\n\nI do recommend this game, mostly for its story at the very least.", "timestamp_created": 1663538315, "timestamp_updated": 1663538315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122444457": {"recommendationid": "122444457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195334145", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 933, "last_played": 1663426745}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2611 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2611 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1663520974, "timestamp_updated": 1663520974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122408817": {"recommendationid": "122408817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373555770", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 948, "last_played": 1663466363}, "language": "english", "review": "The second season is as strong as the first, very emotional and full of suspense, with every moment you seem to live at full and with very difficult decisions to make that teaches you how to let go and where you will lose everyone and everything that is left good: \"They're all going to die, Clementine.

There's no real difference so I saw fit to put here my thoughts about season 2.\nDisclaimer#2: I have enjoyed most of my time playing this. I'm not exactly saying that I \"don't recommend\" this. Why thumbs down then? Well, all in all I find myself feeling very disappointed. Since this game has a very good reception I'm allowing myself to rant about it more than usual.\nDisclaimer#3: Spoilers may follow\n\n[h1]Short review[/h1]\n+ All iconic Telltale games features are here - cool soundtrack, minimalistic but good comic-book style graphics, cinematic experience, story-driven adventure.\n+ Story has some very effective and intense moments.\n+ That's really tiny, but the GUI is so much better and more responsive than that of the previous game. Sheesh!\n\n-Still, weaker story than of season 1.\n-Characters usually lack depth and true interest, and are at best forgettable to downright annoying.\n-[spoiler] I expected more continuity from season 1 and something more than just killing (almost) everyone and starting a new saga with completely different groups of people which would die sooner or later too, etc. [/spoiler]\n-Choices have so little effect.\n-Horrible technical bug which would not allow to save in the middle of an episode since ep.3 and onwards(may be random, but still).\n\nLonger review follows.\n\n[h1]Technicalities[/h1]\nLet's put aside the technical matters first - In this aspect, season 2 is mostly superior or just the same as season 1: This is a quality adventure with a cinematic gameplay. It's fully story driven. The soundtrack is good and fitting very well the atmosphere for both the intense and calmer moments of the story. The graphics are slightly improved, but the usual Telltale comic-book style. The in-game interface is tidied up a bit. Also, playing this straight after season 1, I've noticed how the menus there were very laggy and clunky and here they were (finally) much more smoother and responsive. Which is pretty important imo.\n\nOne horrible thing in this aspect is that the checkpoints system seem to randomly break at some point. Since EP3 and onwards I could not save in the middle of an episode. I have tried messing with it several times and had to restart the episode about 3 times after completing a relatively big part of the episode. Since they won't ever let us skip dialogues, this was very painful.\nAlso, as someone who likes to play in a short intervals, it was rather painful to have to play whole episodes in a ~2-3 hours sessions.\nAfter googling this a bit, seems that this bug affects the original game as well, and not only the definitive edition. Also looks like it does not affect EVERYONE but would randomly occur to some players. Still, no solution to this and that's very disappointing.\n\n[h1]Story since Season 1[/h1]\nNow, I can go on to what really matters in this kind of games - the story elements.\nAs I mentioned at first, I DID enjoy this game very much, most of the time.\nThe story was intense and intriguing. Clementine is a very likable and relatable protagonist.\nStill, I'm majorly disappointed at many points of it and can't help but feel this goes a few steps down from season 1.\n\nNot entirely sure why, but the writers chose to completely ditch almost everyone and everything that's happened in season 1. [spoiler]Of the very few characters that survived, they pretty much finish off Omid and Christa right at the beginning of the season. The part of Clementine having to survive all alone in the world for some time was a strong point of the story, but quickly enough she connects to a new group of people, just to be entangled at some dramas which feel awkwardly parallel to those of S1.\nAnyway, having Kenny back was a nice surprise (I never liked him, though) and the very tiny cameo appearances of the 400 Days characters felt more like an insult.\nAnd right, there's Bonnie, which was OK but didn't really fit into any major part of the story in both season 1 and 2, imo.\nAt the end of this season, once again most of the characters are dead [/spoiler] and so it appears that although making this a \"Series\", the writers didn't really want anything to do with any story too complex and continuous but rather more self-contained stories with disposable characters.\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\nWhich leads me to the next point - characters were much weaker in this season. While in season 1 we have at least had the time to get to know and connect to the characters, learn a bit about their origins and motives, and maybe even slightly care about them, in here there was very little time left for that. I guess a zombie apocalypse really is not the best time to get to know one another, but still, the result is that this season - to me - felt more like a thriller with chains of intense events where I really just wanted Clementine to survive while she entangled with a group of strangers tearing itself apart. The whole writing and dynamic between the characters just felt a little off to me, and it seemed like large portions of the game were about watching some stranger adults fight and yell at each other with someone dying every now and then one way or the other.\n\n[h1]Choices[/h1]\nWhat leads me once again to the next point - Telltale games have always claimed to tailor themselves to how we play. At this point, I've already played TWD S1, Batman, The Wolf Among Us, and some Game of Thrones, and I understand that this is mostly an illusion. STILL - in those titles it felt like there's at least SOME variety possible by our choices. In season 2 - it is very apparent that the choices matter even less than before, making the tiniest and not very interesting alterations to the heavily pre-scripted scenes of the game.\n\n[h1]Ending[/h1]\nWith all that's said above, I was still relatively alright with Season 2 until I played Episode 5 to the end. While there was still the right amount of heart warming along with intense and\\or heart-breaking moments, this episode really brought to story to fall flat on its face. [spoiler]I've really felt nothing much happened besides what's left of the group just fighting with each other. The whole saga with the russians&Arwo felt completely forced and redundant. Towards the end, of course we go on with killing some more characters or just having them ditching off so that the story won't have to actually deal with them (not the Mike & Bonnie felt like very significant characters to the whole picture). [/spoiler]\nThe very ending may actually alter significantly depending on your very final choices. Many of the possible endings (around 5 or 6 in total, I think) are very well done and emotionally draining scenes, fitting to this season.\nStill, for me, the final episode was mostly a mess, and while I haven't played seasons 3 & 4 yet and holding myself to not look up for spoilers, I already assume that it doesn't really matter what ending I came to eventually, this will have very little to no effect on the rest of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1663334378, "timestamp_updated": 1663334525, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122314653": {"recommendationid": "122314653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851252445", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1689672800}, "language": "english", "review": "as if i had less things to cry about already", "timestamp_created": 1663320218, "timestamp_updated": 1663320218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122300054": {"recommendationid": "122300054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352010467", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 675, "last_played": 1663173559}, "language": "english", "review": "Kenny! <3", "timestamp_created": 1663287312, "timestamp_updated": 1663287312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477079778909683228", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122287662": {"recommendationid": "122287662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198807583892", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 591, "last_played": 1663267145}, "language": "english", "review": "Great continuation of awesome and very sad story...", "timestamp_created": 1663267196, "timestamp_updated": 1663267209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560727834701538086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122276510": {"recommendationid": "122276510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073227290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 789, "last_played": 1538357498}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. h", "timestamp_created": 1660228229, "timestamp_updated": 1660228229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.295384824275970459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120420833": {"recommendationid": "120420833", "author": {"steamid": "76561199105237936", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1147, "last_played": 1660263513}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it", "timestamp_created": 1660181771, "timestamp_updated": 1660181771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120404474": {"recommendationid": "120404474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035298920", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 894, "last_played": 1660155866}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Series to play.

Van a haber situaciones donde esta pasando algo y te genera impotencia porque no podes hacer o decir algo que dirias si el protagonista fuese adulto.

I played the first Season exactly 9 years ago, and I still have a better impression of the first season than the second season up until now. \n\nWhat is good: the characters are more or less believable, the athmosphere is really good (read: depressing, as it should be) and I was happy to see Clementine again, which I kinda developed fatherly feelings for in season one. Which tells you how good the storytelling in S1 was. \n\nWhat is bad/annoying: S1 was basically an interactive movie where you chose minor plot changes (but with much emotional baggage) like which side-character dies or which way to go, or who to cheer up. S2 makes you feel very openly that your choices don't matter. I know the general direction of the plot is fixed, but there are several deaths in this game that feel really impactful at first, but then you notice that those characters where hardcoded to die. I had a saving-error and had to redo a part of the game, so I chose a different plot option. The result was 100% the same. Down to the t. The worst part is that the game does not do a very good job at hiding this fact. \nThere are \"sneaking sections\" where my only \"choice\" is to click to go into the direction that I have to go...\n\nThe story itself seems alright until now, so I will continue \"playing\" it. Mostly because I am invested in Clementine from Season 1 still. But it really really feels like an interactive movie. Which is annoying.\nMore so: after each episode, there is an outlook what will happen in the next episode, and you cannot skip it. If you minimize the window, the game will wait for you to maximize again, so you must watch it!  So they basically spoiler the plot for the next episode.  Each episode is about 1,5h to play, so when you have a more extended gaming evening, you are *forced* to sit through plot-spoilers for the thing you plan to do in the next hour. \n\nSo all in all, I will vote negative to express my dissatisfaction with some of the story-telling choices they did, even though the story itself is indeed interesting.

the story which begun with Season 1.\n\nI consider the first season of this game series to be fantastic and this one simply continues that trend. The quality of the writing is still at the kind of level that the first one set and the voice acting and other aspects too. The quality of the models/textures at times can be a little better than the first.\n\nFor the most part this game plays like the previous one. You control a character from a third person perspective and essentially live out a portion of their story during this zombie apocalypse. At certain times you're given some hard choices and they will change the outcomes and details of some aspects of the story. There were some improvements with some of the Quick Time Events (QTE) scenarios and some of the \"mini-game\" sections compared to the previous titles.\n\nThe technical gripes I had with the first season were addressed for this sequel.

I also quite enjoy the ending in whatever you choose decides how you start the next game Either with kenny, in the camp, or at the shipyard you've been trying to get to. There were some previous things/people in the first game that we never really saw what happened to them such as kenny and what I like in this chapter is the return of him.\n\nStill great game overall, would recommend buying if its on sale for those non-telltale game lovers but definitely buy if you are a diehard telltale games fan", "timestamp_created": 1655451052, "timestamp_updated": 1655451052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117050645": {"recommendationid": "117050645", "author": {"steamid": "76561199055952068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1220, "last_played": 1655343393}, "language": "english", "review": "the twd games are perfection in every way", "timestamp_created": 1655343430, "timestamp_updated": 1655343430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116909331": {"recommendationid": "116909331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369056032", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 600, "last_played": 1695199163}, "language": "english", "review": "Every time I decide to let Clem shoot someone I feel like I'm shooting myself.

Unlike the first one, I felt absolutely no challenge, just annoyed to restart some parts when you fail the QTE.\nThere are no puzzles nor complicate item combinations like in classic point & click games. \nThe only thing to do is walk around, click on things, succeed at QTE and make some choices (with a few that are quite gut-wrenching).\n\nThe story is not as good as the first one, the locations and situations are interesting.

hizo muy buen y esta tambi\u00e9n, pero no es igual, de hecho es peor en esta, de todas formas las elecciones son generales, as\u00ed que es muy probable que te quedes satisfecho al final de cada decisi\u00f3n \n-el juego tiene secciones donde tienes que hablar mucho y otros donde debes elegir mucho, sea en elecciones dificiles o combate, y eso es molesto, ya que te dan mucho de uno, pero poco de otro, y luego mucho de eso otro, pero poco de lo anterior a lo que te hab\u00edan dado mucho\n-Kenny esta todo el juego quejandose de todo, eso no ayuda para que quiera ayudarlo, pero bueno, supongo que quedaron secuelas del anterior juego xd\nPros:\n+el desarrollo de Clementine es bastante bueno, se siente muy natural y pausado\n+los entornos son muy buenos y se aprovechan bastante bien para solo durar 10 horas el juego\n+la nueva mecanica de flechas me gusto mucho, pero debieron ponerla un poco mas brillante, casi me muero unas 2 veces por no verla bien\nCalificaciones:\n-Historia: 8.8/10\n-Personajes: 9.6/10\n-Narrativa 8.4/10\n-Sountrack: 10/10\n-Expectativa: 8/10\n-Realidad: 9.5/10\nMuy recomendado para la gente que le gusto el primer juego\n(AVISO: este juego si o si tienes que jugar la primera parte si quieres disfrutarlo al 100%)", "timestamp_created": 1643347082, "timestamp_updated": 1643347082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

She is really well written and interesting.\n\nBut i have some troubles which are the reason i give this a negative review:\n- no official french translation, which is bad since s1 and 3 have it.\n- there is a general \"choose X then it doesn't really matter because the story will consider you will have chosen Y or something close to Y in any case\" issue which is really problematic because it happens in times where you would have a different \"reasoning\" for story in the season 1. So the comparison to s1 is not for the better on this point. \n- At some point, you even have the NPC prevent you to do your choice. If that was all, I would just shrug and think about something else. But it is then marked in the choices as \"You choose not to do it\"... and that pissed me a lot because i didn't know if it was a continuity bug or just the game preventing me to have my choice taken into account by the game and \"forcing\" the choice I didn't want at all.\n- and finally, but that's maybe only me, there are multiple time where I couldn't play the Clementine I wanted. I wanted my Clementine to be a hard human, transformed to steel due to what she lived with Lee in s1. There were many times I wanted to be able to say sentences as \"I will kill you\" to some characters in the game or even think those sentences. But I couldn't. And even when there is the opportunity for revenge, I only have the choice to watch it, not to enact it myself or at least try to do it myself. \n- Finally the story of the game uses more of \"stupid\" moments. At some points I was like: \"ok i get it, you don't like each other. Can you just shut up and deal with the walking deads who are coming on us first, then resume yelling at each other?\" The ending of episode 4 is just such bad moment. I didn't felt anything for the scene because I was just mad that the characters in the game were stupid to the point where their survival is of no matter to me.\n- in episode 2 i would have loved to make a shot myself because the character in game is so stupid that he thinks his bullets go through concrete or sturdy walls... I understand the fact that Clementine is a little girl so i cannot shoot okay, but then at least give me an option to TELL the character that what he intends to do is stupid...\n- for a game with few bullets, the characters sure waste them a lot.\n- And finally the story offers more and more ingame reasons to just give up on some characters, and go with another character... but no, you are forced to go with the stupid ones even if the going away one makes more sense. That's a bit sad because it goes with the other \"story forces me\" issues of this season.\nIn the first season, staying with the group made sense, and leaving didn't so it was totally okay and not a problem. [spoiler]Here the conflcits come from a rotten group at its core and... you will not be able to leave when you want even if it makes sense to leave with the \"smart\" character.[/spoiler]\n\n- the episode 4 ends with characters saying something ([spoiler]i stole the meds from the Russian Arvo guy [/spoiler] ) which is simply not true: i choose not to do that thing. It is never explained if it is a continuity error, a deliberate lie from the characters, or something else. It feels really bad because I would have loved to say \"it was a lie.\" [spoiler]the whole episode 5 is based on a lie in my playthrough since i didn't steal the meds from Arvo in episode 4, and at NO point can i say it in game.

They came very close to the perfection of the orignal. Lots of emotional highs and lows.\n\nMy only 2 complaints:\n\n1. As usual your choices don't actually matter. It's just the illusion of choice. It's what you expect from a Telltale title. It can be overlooked though since the story itself is intriguing. It would be nice though if your choices actually had a lasting impact instead of always ending up at the same crossroad no matter what you choose. I understand, however that can be difficult and/or expensive to program multiple branching paths like that.\n\n2. The adults in this game are mostly useless. So often they rely on Clementime, (who if im not mistaken is a 10 year old girl at this time in the series) to vitally important tasks for them. Or to make very important decisions for the group. Like I get this is the apocalypse and kids grow up fast and probably have a larger say in what happens in a survival group like this. But the only person who would have this much reason to put so much faith in Clementine is Kenny since they have history. There's just a bit too much of the grown men and women standing around with their thumbs in their pockets for me to overlook it.\n\nIt's still worth experiencing at least once though.",

ingl\u00e9s, pero se puede poner en espa\u00f1ol de una forma muy sencilla gracias a las guias de la comunidad de Steam.\nLo segundo es que en esta rese\u00f1a ar\u00e9 alusi\u00f3n al juego anterior a este The Walking Dead: Season Two, por lo que si no lo has jugado, puede aparecer alg\u00fan spoiler.\n\nAhora si, vamos con la rese\u00f1a!\n\nThe Walking Dead: Season Two, sigue la historia de Clementine, la ni\u00f1a que Lee (nuestro anterior protagonista) rescata al inicio del apocalipsis zombie. Al perder casi por completo a su grupo de compa\u00f1eros de la primera entrega, Clementine deber\u00e1 sobrevivir sola en un mundo donde la fina linea entre enemigo o aliado cada vez se difumina mas.\n\nThe Walking Dead: Season Two sigue su linea de la primera entrega, donde las decisiones que tomes tendr\u00e1n consecuencias futuras en la historia. Jugablemente no sigue siendo la gran cosa, pero si que es verdad que se han a\u00f1adido algunas combinaciones de botones para superar determinadas situaciones que en la anterior entrega no estaban. La historia es el punto fuerte de esta clase de juegos, pero en esta ocasi\u00f3n me ha parecido peor que la primera season, aunque sigue siendo bastante buena, y consigue engancharte lo suficiente como para siempre querer saber lo que pasa a continuaci\u00f3n.\n\nEn definitiva, si te gustan las aventuras graficas episodicas, con tematica zombie y una trama bastante entretenida te recomiendo este juego, eso si, cuando lo veas de oferta.\n\n\n---{Graficos}---       \n\ud83d\udd32 Obra maestra\n\ud83d\udd32 Hermoso\n\ud83d\udd32 Bueno\n\ud83d\udd33 Decente\n\ud83d\udd32 Horrible\n\ud83d\udd32 Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\ud83d\udd32 Vas a jugar 24/7\n\ud83d\udd32 Le vas a hechar muuchas horas\n\ud83d\udd32 Muy bueno\n\ud83d\udd32 Bueno\n\ud83d\udd33 Nada especial\n\ud83d\udd32 Malo\n\n---{Audio}---\n\ud83d\udd32 Orgasmo auditivo\n\ud83d\udd32 Muy bueno\n\ud83d\udd33 Bueno\n\ud83d\udd32 Decente\n\ud83d\udd32 Malo\n\ud83d\udd32 Violaci\u00f3n auditiva\n\n\n---{Audiencia}---\n\ud83d\udd32 Ni\u00f1os\n\ud83d\udd32 Adolescentes\n\ud83d\udd33 Adultos\n\ud83d\udd32 Todos\n\n---{Dificultad}---\n\ud83d\udd33 Solo presiona algunos botones\n\ud83d\udd32 Facil\n\ud83d\udd32 Facil de aprender / Dificil de dominar\n\ud83d\udd32 Dificil\n\ud83d\udd32 Dark Souls\n\n---{Historia}---\n\ud83d\udd32 No tiene\n\ud83d\udd32 Algo es algo supongo\n\ud83d\udd32 Promedio\n\ud83d\udd33 Bueno\n\ud83d\udd32 Te har\u00e1 llorar o reir un mont\u00f3n\n\n---{Tiempo de juego}---\n\ud83d\udd32 Muy corto\n\ud83d\udd32 Corto\n\ud83d\udd33 Promedio\n\ud83d\udd32 Largo\n\ud83d\udd32 Depende del jugador\n\ud83d\udd32 Infinito\n\n\n---{Modo individual}---\n\ud83d\udd33 Si\n\ud83d\udd32 No\n\n---{Modo online}---\n\ud83d\udd32 Si\n\ud83d\udd33 No\n\n\n---{Precio}---\n\ud83d\udd32 No lo pienses y compralo\n\ud83d\udd32 Vale la pena\n\ud83d\udd33 Espera a la oferta\n\ud83d\udd32 Si te hace ilusi\u00f3n, si\n\ud83d\udd32 No recomendado\n\ud83d\udd32 No tires dinero a la basura\n\ud83d\udd32 Free to play\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\ud83d\udd33 Nunca tuve ninguno\n\ud83d\udd32 Bugs menores\n\ud83d\udd32 Varios bugs\n\ud83d\udd32 Puede volverse molesto\n\n\u2611 RECOMENDADO \u2611", "timestamp_created": 1638381049, "timestamp_updated": 1638381049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035129547119141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104897546": {"recommendationid": "104897546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134186478", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 794, "last_played": 1452115036}, "language": "english", "review": "completion, Great, lots of fun, sad, but, truly, a masterpiece, bring it, back for a round 2, and you-ll be, surprised, baby, lets go,.\n", "timestamp_created": 1638308097, "timestamp_updated": 1638308097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104878528": {"recommendationid": "104878528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355574122", "num_games_owned": 534, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1586460323}, "language": "english", "review": "This game feels the shortest out of all of them because you are with the same people the majority of the game.

nothing to add on top of what I already wrote about the first season. The way how these games are presented - in episodic dozes with good story structure - suits this genre perfectly. I enjoyed playing the game episode by episode every evening and it felt great this way. After all it is basically an interactive story so maybe, in a way, as a medium it's closer to a movie than a game. \nAs a game though, there is nothing much really to talk about because it's just an exploration of presented environments with quick time events and dialogue choices. The rest is cinematic sequences determined by choices you made. However the presentation and story is The Reason why you should try it. The game is great and worth every minute I spent playing it. \n\nPros:\n\n+ Presentation\n+ Length \n+ Story\n+ Characters\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Some game-play improvements since the Season One\n\nCons:\n\nNothing. \n\n\nAs great sequel as it gets. \n\nGo and grab it (along with the rest of the series).", "timestamp_created": 1637174495, "timestamp_updated": 1637176114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102944749": {"recommendationid": "102944749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409190901", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 842, "last_played": 1648520515}, "language": "english", "review": "SOOO good, I just wish we would\u2019ve gotten more of what we were told!!

Gameplay is the same as many Telltale games, a story-focused game where you get to move around sometimes but most of the time you'll be choosing dialogue options, and sometimes QTEs. If you're expecting a combat game, you won't find it here.\n\nThis season we focus on Clementine instead of Lee, and we play as her throughout the whole game. You will meet groups of survivors, and like last season, you must prepare yourself for some feels since some of them will definitely die, and you can't help it. A strong point in this season for me is the appearance of Carver, a human antagonist voiced by Michael Madsen, whose voice I enjoy because of Dishonored and overall an interesting character.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan of The Walking Dead franchise or even zombie stories to enjoy this game. It doesn't really connect with the books or series. You just need to like story games, and you'll enjoy Telltale's TWD series.

Normally, I'm against [i]'movie style games' [/i] but The Walking Dead 2 does a great job of engaging the player with the story and leading them in the right direction while still giving them that sort of [i]'open world feel'[/i]. The only game that does this better that I can think of is [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222140/Detroit_Become_Human/]Detroit - Become Human[/url], however, both games shine in different ways. \n\nI'd also like to acknowledge how well this game plays with emotions and then leads you through the story, leaving that insatiable feeling in your gut. I mean, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/261030/The_Walking_Dead_Season_Two/#app_reviews_hash]the game is literally bringing people to tears, because of how well it does this.[/url] Just to give you a taste of how emotional the dialogue is: \n\n[spoiler] Clementine: \"I'm scared, Lee.\"\n  Lee: [i]\"What can I tell you to make it better?\"[/i]\n  Clementine: \"That you won't leave me.\"\n  Lee: \"Oh, I wouldn't do that. I promise. Everything's gonna be all right.\"[/spoiler]\n\n\nIt's quite apparent when you compare both the reviews, and the improved gameplay and animation itself, that TellTale has learned from [url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series]their failures in the past [/url]and sought out to develop a game that has more or less defined the story genre itself. \n\nThe series itself has its ups and downs but the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/207610/The_Walking_Dead/]earlier Walking Dead games [/url]are incredible. If I'm being honest, there were very few times where I knew what was going to happen, [spoiler]or who might die[/spoiler] The game keeps you on your toes. It's not predictable in any way, shape or form and that is something that not many story games can do.\n\n My only criticism is that sometimes it feels too much like you're playing a detective game at times, as well as the fact that when you open the game it says [b]\"The story is tailored to how you play\"[/b] [spoiler]which is more or less a bit misleading, and as soon as you replay the game you will see that your choices have little to no impact on the story[/spoiler] That said, I still commend the developers for the amazing story that this game has to offer and I'm sad to have seen it die out over recent years but it was a masterpiece of its time and I enjoyed every second of it. I'm really sad to see the company shut down after such emotional yet brilliant masterpieces like these, however the series will live on,[i] providing people keep playing it.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1636267020, "timestamp_updated": 1646220425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102337367": {"recommendationid": "102337367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126792626", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1636417987}, "language": "english", "review": "T_________T best game ever even thoooooou its sad", "timestamp_created": 1636223332, "timestamp_updated": 1636223332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102331211": {"recommendationid": "102331211", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092314031", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 681, "last_played": 1636217277}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1636216294, "timestamp_updated": 1636216294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102323094": {"recommendationid": "102323094", "author": {"steamid": "76561199040938091", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 829, "last_played": 1668816248}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1636207125, "timestamp_updated": 1636207125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102298108": {"recommendationid": "102298108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837675950", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 587, "last_played": 1634017404}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't like that almost everybody dies but that's the trend in The Walking Dead games...

Sadly, Omid dies in a f*cking bathroom right at the beginning and you're left only with Christa to try and get to Wellington, a safe place she talks about. You two got attacked and got separated, then Clementine has to survive alone, but it doesn't go too well from the start, you get badly injured and then two men find and save you before taking you to their group.\n\nThe story is filled with a lot more action than season one, actually there's almost non-stop action, making you feel like nowhere is safe and so there's this constant pressure that anything could happen at any given time, and I like that, because it really is like that, you might start to like a character and next thing you know, there's a bullet in their head or they might die in a dumb way, but I think this is more realistic, since not everyone has a \"heroic\" death, sometimes they just die from dumb stuff.\n\nThere's also moments that get the best of you, for example, when you get captured by Carver, there's a scene when this guy slaps Clementine and OH MAN I wanted to punch that sonuvabitch through my monitor.\n\nMost of the characters are unique and interesting, but some were questionable, Luke was likeable at the beginning and he seemed like a character you can trust, but then when you try to escape Carver's camp or whatever that was, he tries to stop you once again and when you finally had him at gunpoint you choose not to shoot him? Like after all he's done he thinks about letting him live? If you're gonna let him live he's gonna come after you, AGAIN, and this time to kill you, he chased you for like 5 nights or so  and you think he won't try again? And a lot of moments when he doesn't even think straight or just says senseless stuff, he once almost gets your group killed because instead of looking out for walkers and scouting the area he f*cks around with Jane, and since I mentioned Jane can I just say that she's actually mental? She comes out as a loner and even left the group but then she comes back, she does save us though I'll give her that, and after that you're glad she came back but you'll soon regret it, because near the end when Clem, Jane and Kenny get separated in the snowstorm and meet again she comes to you without AJ and tells you to stand back and watch so you'll see that Kenny is a bad man? B*tch.. you hid AJ and lied that he died just to get Kenny angry so he'll fight you? FOR WHAT? She actually deserved to die there, of course Kenny is gonna be angry, especially after how much he lost along the way, Duck, Katjaa, Sarita and now you come at him with that bullsh*t? Of course he lost his sh*t, he tought AJ died when he swore he'd look out for him.\n\nBut besides that, the story was amazing, the human interactions, the trauma surrounding each of the characters, the raw-ness of it all blended it together beautifully. The ending brought a tear in my eye to be honest, Kenny sacrificed himself so Clem and AJ could make it inside Wellington and have a chance at living as close as you can get to a normal life, he gives AJ his hat and then tells you [i]\"I'm real glad to have met you, Clementine.\"[/i] that sh*t had me bawling, not gonna lie. :(\n\nThe Walking Dead Season Two is a perfect continuation of the first season and I'm glad I was here to experience it.\n\nAbsolutely beautiful.", "timestamp_created": 1634909751, "timestamp_updated": 1634910073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101398118": {"recommendationid": "101398118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410715123", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1090, "last_played": 1665938939}, "language": "english", "review": "The second best part of the series (right after the first season).

This time the game focuses on the day-to-day survival and human contacts, without a clear goal. \n\n[i]Warning: for the story and characters, The Walking Dead: Season One should be played before this. There will be spoilers of S1 in this review. If you haven't played S1 and are interested in playing these, I recommend not reading this review beyond the header. You can find my review of S1 [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TNTFTB/recommended/207610/]here[/url]. [/i] \n\n[h2]Alone, and trying to survive [/h2]\nWith Lee departed, Clementine has to survive on her own, something she isn't capable of yet. She has to find a group of people to stay alive, but the world has become hostile towards strangers. \nThis game focuses even more on the human interactions during an apocalypse and staying alive during the winter. There is no clear goal like in S1 (finding parents, or a boat), just to survive and to get along with each other. \n\n[h2]Upgraded technicals [/h2]\nS2 has upgraded significantly over S1 visualwise. The resolution is a lot higher, and there has been clear effort to make every scene as nice as could be. S1 created resources, which can be found in S2.\nMusic and voice acting are always good with Telltale games. \nAnd with Telltale games, QTE's are a staple. Sadly. \n\n[h2]My experience [/h2]\nSome parts are better than S1, but overall the experience was a bit worse. That sounds more severe than the reality, S1 is a very good game. \nS2 is a lot more streamlined at least. S1 fell a bit silent at times, which doesn't happen in S2. There is a very good balance between action, dialogue and social interaction. There are a lot of locations, just like S1. This also means there is never a save home to stay, and thus there is never a sense of security for Clementine. \nAnd that is a very weak point in this game. A child like Clementine is relatable for many people, but in an apocalypse world?? Lee was such a strong protagonist, especially with Clementine. Alone she is vulnerable, although she is tough as nails. It just less fun to follow a child in a damned world. \nThe game excells in character development and human interaction. It takes it time to converse between the different characters, and develope their relationship, for better or worse. This is very realistically done, as far as I can determine. \nI have come to accept that Telltale games have the illusion of choice. All choices do is adjust a few lines, or maybe the way someone dies. This doesn't mean I appreciate such shallow depth choices, but it is what it is. \n\n72/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers).

I won't name names so to not spoil the ending for anyone that hasn't played, all I will say is that this was an incredible experience, and I only wish Telltale Games didn't shut down, I would have loved more of TWD, and even a third season to Minecraft: Story Mode. The story may be the same cookie-cutter format that most of their games followed, but who's to say that means the game still isn't good?\n\nI would definitely recommend the game if it's still available for purchase, along with Season 1. I haven't played Michonne or Seasons 3 or 4 yet, but I plan to play through them very soon, and I'm sure they're just as great.", "timestamp_created": 1631761434, "timestamp_updated": 1631761434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99414460": {"recommendationid": "99414460", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996519701", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1029, "last_played": 1631829999}, "language": "english", "review": "Season two seems more linear than the first season.
