The developer's passion for this down-under haven has come across very clearly, as new updates have consistently occurred to this already-impressive creation since launch. In the spirit of Animal Crossing and other farm sim games you will find a chill, creative experience here, but with an Aussie twist. You can build, decorate, fish, hunt, mine, aid townsfolk, and farm to your heart's content at a relaxed pace.  No two people's game will be the same because of the enormous level of customization and creation possible here. When you want a break from more intense gaming offerings on Steam, this game is a welcome respite to replace any frustration with joy and any stress with relaxation. It's great to decompress after a long day at work or soul-crushing gaming session with a souls-like.

You can unlock many new recipes, abilities and whole game mechanics through purchasing Licenses from an npc. The brilliance comes from how you earn License Points, which is by doing virtually anything in the game. License Points are unlocked via Milestone achievements in an adventure log. These scale up in number depending on how many you've completed, for example: catch 10 bugs, then 50, then 100, then 500, etc.\n\nThe great thing is, there is a milestone for doing virtually anything in the game. There's the typical ones you'd expect like harvesting crops, catching fish, etc but there's other ones like for just walking around, or breaking tools, there's even for taking damage. This really makes it feel like no matter what you do in Dinkum, you are constantly progressing and utilizing your time towards unlocking things. In a game that has so much to do the game makes sure its  rewarding you for simply playing and partaking in any of these things. From mining, combat, fishing, farming, crafting, buying and selling items, etc. It means that no matter what you choose to do in a day you feel like it wasn't wasted, which I think is crucial in these types of games.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1700571566, "timestamp_updated": 1700571566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150533801": {"recommendationid": "150533801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305228489", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "playtime_at_review": 11730, "last_played": 1700347113}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a little bit of everything!

There's tin everywhere but it seems like almost all important recipes and buildings and tools require a lot of copper and it's NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. I can walk around all day and be lucky to find two veins of it. It seems really broken.

There is no borderless window mode so every time I pause the game I have to use the windows button just to be able to access my other monitor.

So much stuff to pick up it needs an auto pick up. Might be further in the game, but I haven't seen it. Turning just a bit to the left or right is a PAIN, might not sound important but when your Fishing its critical. Items get super expensive and the tool breakage rate doesn't help much. You feel like your barely treading water sometimes just trying to pay off a simple building that costs 125k coins. Selling: I dont know who came up with this stupid system but they need to be taken out back and beaten. You don't know what any single item is worth unless you sell it first.

Even though health is easy to handle, energy can be a challenge when you need to do a lot of tasks, as you can only consume up to 3 meals. And if you do not eat on time, you lose some precious time. Mid and end game meals make it easier to manage.\n\nResident system:\nAlthough it's a nice idea, it doesn't seem to be purely random. On one game, the same resident kept visiting each 4 days.

I love it, truly. It's a little buggy here and there, but it's honestly smooth for early access.\n\n-Graphics/performance: ACNH+Minecraft; the colors are SUPER vibrant, so if you have sensitive eyes, you may need to mess around with your pc's color/brightness settings, because I haven't noticed a way to do it in-game. Still running smooth with mods installed.\n-Music/Sound: the music reminds me so much of House Flipper, and I can't tell if I hate it, but I have the music turned down anyways, so potato potato. The thunder crash for thunder eggs makes me jump like a bish every time and I'm still salty. The animal noises are super cute & the villagers sound Animalese-ish.\n-Overall Story/Gameplay: the story is kinda cute. Grandma is a little bossy, but not condescending like a certain tanuki. The friendship system is pretty standard, although the neighbors sometimes have impossible tasks; it's not a game breaking occurrence, just motivation for more unlocks. Definitely grind, but the map is so big that I seriously never get bored of running around and hoarding.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10; I am absolutely obsessed with this game right now; some QoL features are definitely missing, but moddable.

The black entrances in some buildings is also another turn off for me.\nAnd that concludes all my displeasements with this video game.\n\nWith that being said, other than the above displeasements I mentioned, there isn't any complaints from me. its a really damn good game.

I really hope and wish the best for him in the present and the future.\n\nEDIT: One more major downside for this game are the boring NPCs. The npcs are very empty and their existence seem meaningless for the player other than buying/selling/commisions/quests. They are pretty much soulless. You would spend a huge chunk of time and effort trying to gather/ make them move in, but the reward for that isn't very satisfying for me as they are very soul less.

If you need a chill game to just escape to, this is probably it.  Spoiler-ish: truck > motorcycle\n\nI'll update later, but seeing as I have 65+ hours after playing for less than a week, I figured I'd start this now. \n\nImagine Australian Animal Crossing (NH), but you're being bossed around by a grandma, there are giant angry birds, and you have some kickass customization options. I love it, truly. It's a little buggy here and there, but it's honestly smooth for early access. \n\n-Graphics/performance: ACNH+Minecraft; the colors are SUPER vibrant, so if you have sensitive eyes, you may need to mess around with your pc's color/brightness settings, because I haven't noticed a way to do it in-game. Still running smooth with mods installed. \n-Music/Sound: the music reminds me so much of House Flipper, and I can't tell if I hate it, but I have the music turned down anyways, so potato potato. The thunder crash for thunder eggs makes me jump like a bish every time and I'm still salty. The animal noises are super cute & the villagers sound Animalese-ish. \n-Overall Story/Gameplay: the story is kinda cute. Grandma is a little bossy, but not condescending like a certain tanuki. The friendship system is pretty standard, although the neighbors sometimes have impossible tasks; it's not a game breaking occurrence, just motivation for more unlocks. Definitely grind, but the map is so big that I seriously never get bored of running around and hoarding. \n\nOverall: 8.5/10; I am absolutely obsessed with this game right now; some QoL features are definitely missing, but moddable. But for those who don't like modding, that could be an issue. \n\nI'll update later once I've progressed further", "timestamp_created": 1695710448, "timestamp_updated": 1700678506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617612957954406738", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147019622": {"recommendationid": "147019622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020795565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 5150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 828, "last_played": 1696522912}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: I changed to positive after the initial review.\n\nUntil the mine situation is fixed I am giving this game a thumbs down. The cost of the mine pass is far too high and it is one time use. To make matters worse, when you get into the mine there is a chance you will be swarmed by enemies and you are downed and lose the rest of the day. I have had this happen both times I went into the mines. Others have complained about the enemies in the mines as well. The mines are critical to the game therefore this needs re-balanced.\n\nI will also add that I have yet to find either of the two head items for the scarecrows. Without them all my crops are eaten before they can be harvested.\n\nEdit\n\nI am nearing the end of my first year and just started my day and all my money was gone. I payed off the last building available many days ago. The store was closed the day before. I had about an hour's worth of coin on me. It appears that this was due to giving Fletch the requested gift for her birthday, as has been posted on internet forums. \n\n9-28-2023\n\nFor now I will change my review to positive.\n\nWhile the game has a significant imbalance related to iron, which is essential, it is a very enjoyable game.\n\nPositives\n\nStable - no crashes\nActivities -  Farming, bug catching, mining, museum collecting, relationship building, fishing, and more.\nCustomization - Vast amounts of clothing, terrain modifying options, furniture, etc.\nNPCs - Many different NPCs to recruit and build relationships with, each with their own specialties.\n\n\nNegatives\n\nSaves - only after the end of a day, which could be 20 or more minutes.\nMines - Very expensive for when it appears and very unbalanced. I was attacked by 5 enemies the first time I entered. Killing bats is difficult due to the timing required to hit them. This was compounded by the inventor only being available 7-9 days over three visits during the first year who makes an item that is almost required for this location.

At 36 hours however I feel stuck, and not sure if I can be bothered to continue doing the same things over and over again. I cant figure out how to get more islanders to move in, and the endless cycle of bringing the NPCs gifts is getting very repetitive.

Yes, it's a lot of farming, crafting and building. Not to forget grinding is also part of it, but it's not necessary to grind excessively. You can play the game in short sessions and not regularly and still feel the progress over a pretty short period. If you like these attributes or even love these kind of games, Dinkum could be your game.\n\nAlso not to forget it's extremely relaxing. You can progress even while mostly growing plants.

Maybe in comparison to Stardew Valley the game feels inferior, and I think that's true largely to polish, but the idea of building up the whole town, the whole world being your sandbox, in comparison to just a small slice is an awe-inspiring and encouraging feat to tackle. I recommend Dinkum to all, and my more detailed thoughts on the highs and lows are as follows:\n\n+1: The art style of the game is genuinely adorable, like Animal Crossing but warmer and lest harsh on the eyes. Even looking out over the haze of the world across the ocean is something I find myself doing.\n\n+2: The settlers all feel very unique and have a great personality all their own. Though Clover may be a cultist/serial killer, I find myself really clicking with each of the NPCs in different ways, and unlike a game like Stardew, I generally engage with all of them fairly equally.\n\n+3: The wildlife of the world helps it feel like it's always moving, and therefore keeps me wanting to enjoy the beauty of the natural generation.\n\n+4: The shovel-scrap-finding mechanic is actually a really cool idea, and helps make the crafting recipes more reasonable and fun to gather supplies for.\n\n+5: A weird one, but I love the vehicles in the game. I just wish the sailing boat was easier to get the recipe for.\n\n-1: The deep mines are mechanically unbalanced. I don't like having to pay a big chunk every time to use it, especially when it already takes so much to build the elevator. The cost of losing day of progress elsewhere all for some stone and extra ore doesn't feel like it's worth an extra 25k every time you want to use it. Even the secret rooms require keys and collectables that can be hard enough to find. Add to that the difficulty at level 2 and I think the only way to not feel like you've been wasting money and time is if you reset the day when you die; a mechanic I hate doing but often do because of how overpowered those lizards are. I think the elevator passes should be one pass to unlock that level (25k for lvl1, 75k for lvl 2, etc) for unlimited uses and/or the base cost and materials to build the elevator should go up.\n\n-2: Minor, but crafting should really use nearby chests. It's tedious to go back and forth to chests to find things, even with the help of the checklist. It would also help to craft multiple at once: let the game spend 2 minutes crafting a ton of paths while I go to the bathroom rather than have to sit and click a button every 3 seconds.\n\n-3: Crafting blueprints themselves... super tedious and annoying to get. I wish there was more consistency in when you'd get them from NPC quests, offer them in lieu of bulletin board dinks, and give more variety at Franklin's lab. At the very least I'd like to see all the recipes I'm still missing, just greyed out, but more over I think it would be nice to have a wider range of available recipes at shops or some indication as to a blueprint reward for completing a certain request.\n\n-4: Shop inventories in general are frustrating, especially Rayne's seeds. I understand furniture and clothes being a small rotating selection and a list of everything you've already gotten and want more of, but it's really annoying when she doesn't have the seeds you want. There should be a full selection at all times. The same goes for John's goods, at least regarding food and parts as getting Sheila to the island requires so many flour, sugar, and crops that are seasonal and hard to get early means you'll take forever to actually be able to get her recipes.\n\n-5: Either remove the penalty from failing to make a daily request or give the option to speak to the NPC and back out. It's very annoying when RNG means you can't find an item that you've spent a day searching for or it turns out you're missing one ingredient for the recipe. This would also allow you to actually put harder requests like rarer fish and bugs without deterring players all the time.\n\n-6: Rechargeable tools shouldn't break when they drain. I hate that I can't get better tools because every opal has to go to new dirt printers because the bar doesn't always drain at the same rate. It doesn't make sense that the mining helmets turn off when they run out but a power tool just evaporates.\n\nAgain, most of these are fairly minor, and for an early access game. Let me know your thoughts, but I hope the developer takes things like these from a heavy player into account. I love everything you've done, and just want the game to be as approachable and fun as it's clearly built to be!

So, here are my thoughts on Australian Harvest Moon with a dash of Animal Crossing.\n\nFor an early access title, it's pretty fun! There's a lot of things that are there at the jump for you to interact with once you unlock them, from farming and animal rearing to fishing and animal hunting. You go out into your own little outback and start to build a little town from the ground up, enticing townsfolk into your little community by doing tasks for them. At the time of this review I have only 4 people in my town and the last one to finish a major task hasn't wanted to join my town. There is also a debt system similar to Animal Crossing with building any building and the prices are a BIT high, especially for the beginning of the game.\n\nAnother problem I have is that it feels like resources for certain things are sort of hard to find? Copper especially seems very scarce to find once tin/iron seem to be the main material for most crafting materials. Granted I did just unlock the deep mines so perhaps more ore is plentiful down there. The game music also doesn't really loop much, going into long stretches of time with no sound.\n\nA MAJOR problem that is a bit of a nit-pick is that time in game does not freeze unless you hit a button in the book menu to actually pause the game. Talking with npcs and buying/selling things does not freeze the time so it feels like you're in a rush to do these actions unlike most farming sim games of this variety.\n\nOverall, the experience is fun and it is enjoyable to play with only a few minor things that dampen the fun only slightly.", "timestamp_created": 1692761406, "timestamp_updated": 1692761406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144827671": {"recommendationid": "144827671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043387106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 557, "last_played": 1695582565}, "language": "english", "review": "my partner was telling me about this game. \"its harvest moon, animal crossing and stardew valley combined... but in the outback\".... well i love anything Australian ... well they bought the game and i watched them play., they were right. its amazing. its just as my partner described but better. i highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1692756959, "timestamp_updated": 1692756959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144819927": {"recommendationid": "144819927", "author": {"steamid": "76561199510713758", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 34053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1742, "playtime_at_review": 5684, "last_played": 1700682293}, "language": "english", "review": "Loving this game !!", "timestamp_created": 1692744899, "timestamp_updated": 1692744899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144815377": {"recommendationid": "144815377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185766870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1903, "last_played": 1697858119}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so fun and super cute.

They either have it or will grab it asap as soon as they are made aware of it.\n\nFor everyone else, this is a mishmash of ACNH + Stardew + 3D Harvest Moon + Minecraft. It lacks the soul and charm of all. Like a pale imitation or copy. Even the emotes seem like they were added without much understanding (they're weird). An air of awkwardness permeates Dinkum. If you never managed to get into Minecraft because it quickly starts to feel like work and a manual labor simulator... Dinkum feels more like work than a game. Tons of tasks, chores, tedium, and monotony. I didn't care for the aesthetics either. Pixelated and generic. \n\nThe game just didn't work for me. That preview video at the top of the page is after hundreds of days. This game seems like a, \"It gets better once you get out of Midgar.\" game if you know what I mean. Don't expect jetskis and hang gliders when you start.\n\nI had \"No\" selected while writing this review. I don't imagine the vast majority will stick with it through to the end. I think like many indie games, most are for a niche group of players. However, for the amount of play hours Dinkum will provide for it's cost and the fact that its like the first game to finally try to merge so many other games into 1, I switched it to \"Yes\". I have no plans or patience to play this anymore. \n\nMy favorite thing about 'Dinkum' is just how lazy it makes Nintendo appear to be. ACNH was a big disappointment. Ridiculously shallow. Extremely time gated. Probably a huge team of experienced developers and what we got is what they sold us for 60 big ones ($). A tiny indie game crams more content in for just 20 ones. The state of AAA gaming anymore  is depressing.\n\nVoting with your wallet is getting harder every year in video games and indie games will be the last shining oasis for many gamers to cast their votes and still have a voice. I don't feel bad about buying this game. Maybe years from now, I'll be in a better place mentally where I won't mind dropping 100+ hours on a chores sim game again. Its like my stamina bar needs to refill. Until then, this is a vote I'm happy I made.\n\nHonestly, I have to say it... \"FINALLY!\". Every time a game is popular and does well, copycats come out of the woodwork and release their version in an attempt to get a slice of that sweet pie... or improve upon ideas. Look at 'Vampire Survivor' or any match 3 game, WoW clones, Minecraft clones, the GTA like games. Animal Crossing came out in the 90s. The nineties! It was successful. For decades. No copycats. Top selling game over Covid. Nothing. Then this game releases. Maybe there are other attempts out there, but I don't remember them and never heard of them. ACrossing is a low low bar too and it still took all these years.

To me this game feels like a mixture of Animal Crossing and Castaway Paradise. But I think it is way greater than both of them. Received the game as a gift from my husband and we have been playing it together ever since. It is a great way to just relax and escape todays world and find yourself on an island that you can create and design just the way you like it, do all kinds of tasks to make the island even better. The more you progress and upgrade, the more visitors will come to your island and will introduce all kinds of new things and tasks for you to do.\n\nThe game has realistic elements, and you can even get seriously injured or die, since not all the animals on the island are going to appreciate your presence. Found myself dying a few times because of a wrestling contest with crocodiles and sharks because of me overestimating myself thinking that I would just \"fix that!\" little problem. Battling these animals will go better by practising and upgrading your tools. Same counts for fishing. At first, I was struggling understanding how to reel them in, but it all comes down to practise, keeping a close eye on the indicator on your screen that shows when to stop and when to reel, and of course upgrading your fishing gear.\n\nFor me personally another big plus about this game is that, so far I've seen, it doesn't seem to be pushing any agenda, which is rare for games nowadays. Although, I did noticed some \"New Agey\" references in one of the chat dialogs with an in game character, but it was minimal. Overall, this seems to be an innocent and fun game where you can spent hours and hours unlocking and discovering new things to do and by doing so creating your dream island. I don't see myself getting bored with this game anytime soon.\n\nOne point of critic: There should really come an autosave option, or manually save without having to end the day. In the beginning, there were a few times when my husband and I would be on his Island and suddenly in the middle of the game the server gets disconnected, which results in the visitor getting kicked out and losing all progress. This leads to a lot of frustration and takes away the fun of the game. Hopefully the developer wants to reconsider this. Also, it might be nice to add later on in the game, as you've progressed more, some kind of purchase catalog in the store, where you can purchase all kinds of decoration items for your home, instead of only being randomly offered some of these items every now and then.\n\n9/10 Very impressed. And to know this is just the early access stage makes me even more excited for what is going to come.

I am always chasing games in this genre that capture my attention, and after more than 300 hours, I'm still in love with this game. It isn't even complete yet, but this is definitely an Early Access that is fully functional and has plenty for you to do. It does not [i] feel [/i] incomplete at all and bugs are minimal.\n\nWhy I love it:\n\nFirst, the setting is unique and adds a refreshing layer to the game. The love for Australia is clear in its design and not just set dressing. It's reflected in the environment (biomes, plants, etc.), the animals (both wild and the animals you ranch), the dialogue, objects, food & recipes. It's also quite charming.\n\nEncountering animals in the wild that aren't all friendly is a fun experience! I was surprised how much I enjoy that aspect of the game. It's fun to go out foraging and wind up entangled with a crocodile lol. When I started, I ran away from all of them. Now I feel accomplished defending myself against the wild and enjoy it!\n\nI probably enjoy taking care of my animals & their produce the most because they're adorable & unique to the setting (slightly-fantasy versions of actual Australian animals). I'm not usually a big fan of bug catching in any game (nothing against it, just... bugs lol; not my thing), but I enjoy the new bug-catching competition! For fishing, the ocean & river areas are beautiful & relaxing. Mining is challenging but I enjoy the [spoiler] treasure rooms [/spoiler]! I love just plain exploring. I also really enjoy [spoiler] stealing eggs from the nests of giant wild birds [/spoiler].\n\nI think the balance of options for what to do, time and difficulty is smooth. It's definitely a \"just one more day\" kind of game for me where I don't want to quit! \n\nMultiplayer is fun! I spent the first ~250 hours playing by myself, then started multiplayer with my partner. We've had a great time. We have seen the most bugs in multiplayer, but they're always minor, often goofy and usually resolve by quitting & restarting the day. My favorite is the two times he became an invisible ghost in my world, knocking stuff over or causing floating objects from my perspective lol. We like the mix of being able to go do our own thing independently or help each other on bigger projects or mining & hunting.\n\nThe anniversary event was a fun treat, too, with new prizes you could earn in-game for fishing, including a fun new weapon and cute collectible decor objects.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about this game and I really respect this indie developer. I appreciate his commitment to the game, his vision and the world he's created.

After i got home, i was looking for something to play and feeling very blah so i jumped into this hoping it would be the thing that made me feel better and it is! I was thinking it would be a sort of bland \"farm together\" task sort of simulation game (i love simulation games don't get me wrong) but it's actually much more than i thought it would be and i'm kind of hooked now!\n\nIt's been really cool recovering while playing this game. I haven't even explored the entire map, but i absolutely LOVE this game! I really enjoy the fact that everything, or nearly everything has a use or a purpose and a lot of the items aren't exactly easy to get & take a bit of grinding to obtain.\n\nSome of the animals i thought would be hostile aren't while some i thought would be very tame are not so it's definitely keeping me on my toes. i am pretty impressed with the overall weather and wildlife in the game  especially seeing as one sometimes seems to effect the other as well as time of day and many other things. There is a LOT to do and residents to help out and convince to stay, things to build, and Dinks(money) to earn.\n\nOver all, super happy with this purchase. This turned out to be a really cool game. i hope there are updates in the future and other possible games similar to this from this dev.\n\nSome stuff to note:\n* \"passing out\" or dying damages all your tools, so avoid that!\n*Sleep to save your game if you log out without sleeping until the next day everything you did will be unsaved.\n*If you buy chooks from Irwin, pen them in first so the dingos don't eat them, because it's nearly impossible to pick up an animal once you have placed it!\n*Help EVERYONE! it makes them want to stay in your town and that ultimately helps you out a lot! They will also help you out with items and dinks.\n* BUILD! especially a bulletin and some of the cooking and crafting tables. \n* Check your mail!

You know what's funny about early access games meant for trying out and need feedback before the full release?\n\nExample :\n[b]Players from outside australia:[/b] Sharing feedback\n[b]Aussie :[/b] Fuck you, I didn't make this game.

There are also better features like a rotating camera, items that aren't just repeated 'leaf sprites,' and a larger area to build and explore. Since it's set in Australia, you'll encounter both dangerous and harmless animals that you can hunt for meat. For example, you can hunt dogs and eat their meat.\n\n\u3000 There's so much content that makes this game worthwhile even in its early access state. Overall, I hope they can incorporate new features based on player feedback. And yes, as mentioned above, we've had issues within the community.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]G\u0280\u1d00\u1d18\u029c\u026a\u1d04[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000I didn't mind the game's style\u2014it's cute and beautiful at times. But if you're giving it a go after reading my review, you might notice the colors aren't great. Yep, you're totally right about that. On the forum, some random Aussie might say, 'Fuck you! That's how we see things here! no need to change!' It's kinda funny how they're cool with their whole continent looking that way, basically telling people not to bother visiting Australia. I mean, who'd want goes to a place that has dirt looks like that?\n\n\u3000As for other graphics, sometimes they're a bit off, especially the shadows using that cell shading thing. When it's sunset or sunrise, you'll see this awful shadow effect. But the rest, like the 3D stuff, is fine. Good thing, I found color mods on Nexus, using them now. So, don't afraid thinks the game would make you blind. because mods got it covered.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]M\u1d1c\u029f\u1d1b\u026a\u1d18\u029f\u1d00\u028f\u1d07\u0280[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Online works well, but there's a catch. That's why Terraria is more successful. Different gameplay? I don't care about other Aussie opinions, so screw you. Dinkum has a world seed limit, and some plants don't come back. This traps you into trading in the community, needing to visit others or use two PCs to get a new world for that resource. Unlike Terraria, where you can take your character to other islands or worlds locally, Dinkum makes you trade with random people to buy seeds that won't come back after you chop them in your world. That's my problem. Just watch out for Aussies when trading (If you'ev tried to join the community, you know what i mean).\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]C\u1d0f\u0274\u1d1b\u0280\u1d0f\u029f[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Work well with, D-input.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]P\u029f\u1d00\u028f\u1d1b\u026a\u1d0d\u1d07[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Up to 24h-70h, Bet i can spend more than that!\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]S\u1d1b\u1d0f\u0280\u028f[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Ah yes, you're an Englishman from Britain, loving tea, coming to a continent and claiming it as your own, full of emus.

I would rate it an 11 if I could and it didn't  have bats. It is not just another builder game that quickly gets boring. There is always something to do and is versatile enough to give you many options. If you like to design and build towns, there is a wide variety of materials and decorations . You can also explore, hunt, fish, farm, mine or race your vehicles around the islands. Though I have never played multi-player, you can even have friends join you.

Unfortunately, it fell short.\n\nWhile it does share some similarities with Animal Crossing in its small features, there's a significant missing element: the villagers. Instead of regular residents, all characters on your island serve specific functions like shopkeepers, quest givers, instructors, museum head, etc. Though you can form bonds with them, the depth of those bonds is limited. Furthermore, the lack of variety in characters makes the experience predictable for everyone as the order in which your island grows does not change.\n\nOne minor gripe I have is the monotonous landscape, entirely comprised of different shades of brown. It becomes visually dull with no diversity. Incorporating different biomes or the full implementation of seasonal changes could significantly improve this aspect.\n\nOverall, the game is okay, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're seeking an Animal Crossing-like experience.", "timestamp_created": 1690965299, "timestamp_updated": 1690965299, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451969504356384277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143247883": {"recommendationid": "143247883", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076083098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1357, "last_played": 1697075523}, "language": "english", "review": "20/10 this game has taken up all my free time.

As with all my reviews on early access games, I take a prediction on the future of the game, and I believe Dinkum has a bright one.

It absolutely deserves the love it gets. This game actually feels rewarding to do even the most basic tasks. When you unlock licences by Fletch's tent/town hall, this game doesn't hold me down for anything. \n\nYou can get sprinklers to water the crops for you, there's animals and bosses to defeat, there's hidden (and regular) NPCs that can give you the best stuff in the game if you have the resources, if you reach a good friendship with an NPC they can fight, farm, and harvest with you and a cave system that has some cool items like the glider, a wand that can spawn rocks/ore, a bottle that can make the game rain and more that i haven't even discovered yet. (At my pace lol) Watch out tho if you're new, it can be quite challenging\n\nThis games community is sweet too. The discord has a ton of nice people that can help and even have a tab for mods! Just watch out for those random public lobby trolls.\n\nThe one thing I was afraid of is overabundance the orange desert look when I made my purchase. However when you have the flooring you want, you can make even mountains have an industrial look if you really wanted to. So don't worry about that :)\n\nOverall a must buy especially if you wished more from New Horizons or a fan of chill games like this. \nLastly before I finish this review, Clover is an absolute sweetheart!

It has the concepts from minecraft I loved but with added interactions from towns people like animal crossing! I enjoy making my own town with different maps each time. I enjoy that my map can at any point change from single player to multi-player without being restricted to always being single player on a save. Fishing is very fun and I even miss a few so its not too easy. I love seeing everyone's shared pictures of their unique towns! \n Only draw back for me is I have to step away a lot while playing games and as much as I love the pause button.....

At first, it might almost feel like you're playing an AC fan game, which is far from being a bad thing as AC is incredibly addictive and time-consuming in the best way. For example, you'll never run out of things to do thanks to a daily task system which gives you 3 optional tasks daily. These small jobs can be anything from mining to helping out your neighbors with their requests, and completing the tasks will give you special currency which you can spend on upgrading your toolset and things that you're allowed to do on your island.\n\nSpeaking of the islands, there are a few small areas where this game doesn't act like it should. For example, when you start the game you get a randomly generated island where you begin your first few tasks. These tasks are mandatory for progressing into the more open parts of the game. Unfortunately, on my first time generating one of these islands, I was spawned on a small sand circle where the closest island with the resources I needed to progress was farther than I could swim with the current energy bar. That meant I was stuck and had to start a completely new save. Fortunately, I got a far better island the second time around. Aside from that, the only other issues I've experienced with the game so far are small visual errors such as water tiles not being seamless and my character managing to stick his head through one of the NPC tents.\n\nOverall, despite its few bugs and poor design choices, Dinkum is a great game for anybody looking to express their creativity in a long-term town builder. If you're a fan of Animal Crossing, you'll most definitely enjoy this game. Even if you aren't or haven't played Animal Crossing before, I'd still recommend trying Dinkum as long as you're a fan of building/slow-progression games.

Sometimes you have to do things you DONT want to because then you will feel better about it later. It also helps me with perspective. If I do this boring thing now, future me will be grateful because I can get cooler stuff with dinks! (the in game currency). So definitely give this game a try.

This game feels like a good mix of Animal Crossing and Stardew valley. However, it's lacking in that the game feels a bit empty and soulless. The NPCs are great, but since there aren't a lot of them, the island feels like a barren land.\n\nThe wiki says there are 8 biomes total, but it really just feels like there's 2-3 that are the same but have different colored grass and trees. I'm not sure if I'm playing the game the wrong way, but after 13hrs, I am still in Summer, which I only bring up because that means I've only seen about 3-4 different bugs on the entire island and maybe 4-6 different fish, regardless of the time of day. This island also takes a good amount of time to walk from one side to the other, and the only thing I see along the entire walk are trees, water, and foliage. The animal life is pretty sparse and not too diverse.\n\nWorst of all, I think a lot of this could be remedied if the early game weren't so slow. The energy system feels like something that creates a large unnecessary grind to maintain your energy and keep food supplies for it. Maybe it gets better late game, but it seems to have a lot of grind associated with it to get to the fun part of the game like the trailers have where you have an established town and a nice island. After enabling cheats to see, it also seems like there isn't a whole lot of options for decoration in general.\n\nI think if the game had more to it, it could be very enjoyable. More bugs, fish, and critters would make the island feel more alive. For example, Animal Crossing has anywhere from 20-30 different bugs and 20-30 different fish that can spawn per month, so if the game had something like that with their season system, that would help the island feel more diverse. Also, maybe increasing the spawn rate of insects once there are more would help. \n\nAnother thing that would help is more decoration. Again, I know it's early game and making all of these things takes time, but with Animal Crossing, there's a LOT you can do both in your house and on your island. With Dinkum, even after 13hrs, I have almost 0 decorative options for outside aside from pathways and fences.

A loooot of games.  Dinkum was... a pleasant surprise!  It's definitely not as developed as either of the above games, but it does reflect the spirit of both games.  And I do want to distinguish that from 'ripping off' SV or MC which, again, a LOT of (terrible) other games have ended up being.  Dinkum definitely has many of the same features, but it's all its own flavor.  The world design - characters, objects, animals - are unique and appealing, the map design is clean and distinctive, the quests and gameplay revolve around a novel story.\n\nOn an initial playthrough I found the gameplay very cute, but a slow grind to build the town.  I put it down for awhile, and recently picked it back up - after I stumbled on a discussion that it had mod support!  I downloaded what I wanted and fired the game back up.\n\nNow, I'm not here to say that the game isn't good without mods - there are plenty of people who love it as is.  But the beauty of a game that allows mods is in how it can affect the game.  Worst case scenario, your game remains mostly unplayable but people play longer than they would otherwise because the mods do everything they can to fix what the makers didn't (cough cough, Skyrim, cough cough, My Time At Portia).  Best case scenario is that it can draw in hitherto uninterested players and greatly expand the fanbase, as well as greatly increasing the amount of replayability for those fans.  So I think it's well worth pointing out that while it's not yet workshop enabled (I believe James has stated that he's hoping to implement that later), there are mods available outside of Steam and while the setup is a bit confusing at first (I had to find a tutorial), once you've got the basics done it's very, VERY easy to add and remove, and I have yet to discover a conflict between what I've chosen.\n\nSo what type of mods have made this game more playable for me?  Well, first of all, I have ADHD, and I have worked some VERY stressful jobs in the past.  When I open up a game such as Dinkum or any of the similar I listed, I'm looking for a game that is very peaceful, very isolating, something that makes me feel as if I'm alone in a non-threatening world where I can go as I please and make as I please.  The scenery, the design, and the music all make that happen, and the rest is simply tweaking.  So I turn off animal hostility because I want them to be part of the peaceful and beautiful environment I interact with, not something that's constantly distracting me from it.  I make fish and insects stackable and able to be put in containers because trying to track gifts and quest items tweaks the ol' ADHD anxiety.  I add a sprint feature because I love running and leaping like a gazelle.  I add a communism mod because listen, I'm the one out here doing all the hard work of building and gathering for everyone else's profit, so y'all are gonna get your taxes on new buildings upped, deal with it.  Inventory management, because again, ADHD YIKES.\n\nI do have more but the point is, purists would point at the above and yell \"that's not the same game anymore!\" and my response is \"yeah... isn't it *great*?\"\n\nMaking a game takes a lot of work - a LOT of work.  This game's maker has clearly put their heart into it and they've been very good with providing updates on the progress as well as releasing new content to try and keep people interested while working toward an official release.  Putting aside their ego enough to keep their game friendly to mod makers and to people like me is simply the sign of a very good creator - a creator with a healthy ego that allows for room in their world for people who aren't exactly like them to still come in and have fun.  I'm very grateful for that sort of mindset, and I absolutely believe the early access price is reasonable for what I've received in turn.\n\nI lastly want to hark back to the animals I talked about.  I LOVE the animals in this game.  A great example is 'diggos', clearly a variation on 'doggos' and immediately makes you want to love and cuddle them and make them your pet - and you CAN!  Another sign of a good gamemaker, understands the OBVIOUS result of putting adorable puppers in games and doesn't be a jerk and make them non-interactive forever.  But the hostile animals are just as adorable!  The crocos with their adorable big smiles, the bush devils that are 1000% distant relatives of Stitch, so you're damn right I don't want to fight those cuties!, and the cuuuute frilly frills and their running animation!  There are many more adorable animals to be found, but those are certainly my favorites.\n\nAnyway, it's time to jump back in and play some more Dinkum, but James' latest post reminded me that I've very rudely never sat down and taken the time to express what about the game makes it worth the purchase for me.

Progresses time like Stardew, offers \"building the island of your dreams\" like Animal Crossing, and has some open-world exploration like in Minecraft.\n\nFor the town itself, you have to build everything from scratch and get NPCs to move in, similar to Animal Crossing. You have a set amount of NPCs that you can do requests for and level up their \"hearts\" with you. I'm understanding you gradually unlock more perks as you raise your heart level, but I don't really see much of a difference at this time. \n\nMost things you can't really do immediately, though, since the game works on a licensing system. To get a shovel, you need to get a license. To fish, you need a license. Basically, to do anything meaningful early game, you need to get a lot of licenses. Those licenses are obtained with Permit Points, which is just like the Nook Points in AC. Luckily those points are easy to rack up. It keeps the game at a fair pace so you don't complete everything too fast.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that there's obviously not a lot of content implemented just yet. Some items like toad skin have no use whatsoever besides selling for a meager amount of coins. Bottle-wood trees don't respawn or drop seeds. Once you've explored enough and obtained a few licenses, there's not much more that the game offers. \n\nThere's also a handful of bugs or concerns:\n- Sometimes the map may load incorrectly and you will clip under it and fall.\n- I've had a few dialogue boxes that just say \"Need Text Here\", or there's just blatant grammatical or spelling errors. \n- Shop owners sometimes never navigate to their shop when they're supposed to. This is already pretty frustrating considering NPCs have specific days off. For example, John is off on Sunday entirely, so whatever you need to sell or buy has to wait until Monday.\n\nA few more suggestions:\n- Going back to the NPCs having days off, I like the idea. The reason they have days off is to let the player \"hang out\" with them. They can help you do small tasks like water crops, chop down trees, or maybe hunt. There's not much else, though. There's no way to tell right now what NPCs have what days off though, which is frustrating if I want to go to the bank or buy more seeds. It's not a great trade-off for a \"hang out\" feature that isn't great to begin with.\n- PLEASE make an easier way to make scarecrows besides pumpkins and melons. I have to gamble on whether my crops will survive (including the pumpkins and melons) themselves for a good chunk of the game because I have to wait for those two to grow. And they take almost 2 weeks in-game. \n- Maybe unlock sprinklers earlier or reduce energy for watering? Realistically, you can only have a handful of crops early game since watering them can easily take up all your energy.\n- Stop making NPCs wander so far from town. I hate having to track them down if they decide to wander halfway across the map.\n- There's no separate storage system for clothing and furniture like in Animal Crossing. I am stuck with several crates or drawers just to hold a few shirts, couches, beds, etc. \n\nMULTIPLAYER: \nIt's alright. It's not \"true\" co-op, in the sense that you're really just visiting someone's island and helping them out, like in Animal Crossing. It's not like Stardew, where you feel like you actually have your own livelihood outside of the host. But it's also not as restrictive as Animal Crossing, where you can't even pull out an axe. It's basically having a buddy to help you do things, but they don't really get much out of it. \n\nOverall, I enjoy Dinkum quite a lot, but there still needs to be more content.

I needed a new game and Dinkum caught my eye.  You can keep animals, farm, fish, mine, cook, interact with wonderful NPCs...you name it!  You can also hunt a variety of Australian-themed animals.  Being a animal-loving vegetarian, this really bothered me at first.  But then I decided that if it's an animal trying to kill me, I will defend myself!  Take that Crocos and Bush Devils!!  Not all wild animals here are dangerous, many are benign, and you can even tame a diggo (dingo) and mu (emu.)  The game has incredible depth and is very addictive.  It will be a long, long time before I feel like I've done it all.  With a developer who is very engaged with his following and always taking suggestions for new additions, I don't see this game ever going stale.  James Bendon is the sole developer for Dinkum and I continuously shake my head in wonder at how he's done it.

There were a lot of colorful characters in the game, and you would randomly get a set amount of them in your village, making each person's town different. And the passage of time was tied to your real life clock which made it even more immersive. It made the town feel lived in. You were going back to your town every day during set hours, talking with your neighbours, doing some daily chores and relaxing. With time some new activities would pop up but this was the most of the game.\n\nWhat made SW were also its characters and speed. The characters are the same for every player but it's fine since they're all different from each other personality wise, and feel fun to hang out with. You could grow close to every one of them, and could even romance them. The size of the map is not too large and every day is only 14 minutes in real time. This meant you were racing to get the most of every day. The farming mechanics were the main point of the game so there's a bunch of strategy and variety involved in that as well.\n\nDinkum has none of these, and worst of all, has nothing to distinguish itself from the other games in this type of genre. The characters are all boring and lifeless, every single mechanic in the game is way too simplistic, it's somehow even more grindy than the rest, the map looks cool at the beginning but a short walk shows how empty it is despite being so large, time never runs out, and the energy system doesn't feel balanced. I fail to see the point of this game, there's nothing to strive for. \n\nHope it gets better once it gets out of early access.", "timestamp_created": 1688598711, "timestamp_updated": 1688598711, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488343924283981323", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141406948": {"recommendationid": "141406948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301365924", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10800, "last_played": 1694893577}, "language": "english", "review": "Prepare to lose countless hrs wrapped up in this phenomenal game!

The multiplayer/co-op experience is also more robust than Animal Crossing as you not only can you visit each others' islands as you would in New Horizons, but you can also fully participate as a member of each others' islands as well. all-in-all, if you're an Animal Crossing fan and you're looking for any other game that even scratches that itch, Dinkum is the only one that I've ever found to do so.\n\nit is worth mentioning that the game is an early access game made by only one guy. it's scope is still limited in some ways and there is more content to be added to make the game feel like a fuller experience. interestingly, all the NPCs in the game are people who have also function as town hall workers or store owners, so it's like if Tom Nook, Isabelle, Sable, Mable, etc. were also the only villagers in your Animal Crossing town, albeit with the ability to make small talk and ask for favors and such. I think having NPCs that could just be regular old townsfolk would be a nice addition, and fleshing out your island with neighborhoods of citizens would add some more depth to the game. in general, I hope the future content just gives the player more things to add to their town, both functioning and decorative, as after about 30 hours we're taking a bit of a break as well as waiting for some more content. but with all that said, at $20 Dinkum is more than worth the price.\n\nalso the game is Australian so all the NPCs say g'day mate.", "timestamp_created": 1688275113, "timestamp_updated": 1688275113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141091967": {"recommendationid": "141091967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198975572156", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2864, "last_played": 1688102097}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so fun!

I probably spent more time on this game than with my wife\u2026 at least they have themselves to keep each other company.\n\nDinkum let\u2019s me live out my sexual fantasies of having a house, a job, and someone who cares about me. It\u2019s like Animal Crossing that adults can play without being judged for playing it.\n\nIn truth it\u2019s just a colonizing simulator that casually leaves out the actual horrific history and reality of colonialism in Australia. Just absolutely wonderful!\n\nI am VERY picky with games. I frequently find that new sandbox games coming out are drab and repetitive. Dinkum has the same characteristics as most \u201cfarming\u201d sandboxes - you can farm, fish and catch bugs, and make friends with villagers etc. - yet everything in this game is well developed and interconnected so everything feels like it has a purpose and there are SO. MANY. THINGS. to do! I find my self getting lost in it for hours.\n\nGames like this are about chilling out and slowly taking your time. It's not an objective driven game. Yes, there are tasks... but they're more about giving you ways to unlock things and teach game mechanics... rather than being a mission or story based narrative.\n\nDinkum is, in my opinion, an awesome game.  Does not overwhelm or make it feel like work.  So much more than just farming. I enjoyed the hunting and fishing you can do. As well as the collecting of bugs, fish, and critters to fill the museum up. \n\nMy favorite thing to do is go into the deep mines with friends or even solo. The thrill of the darkness and lurking enemies around the corner is so much fun for me. Plus the rewards for making it out alive can be quite large!\n\nI love the magpie songs. I like the dingos chasing the roos all over. I want to keep an echidna as a pet cause they're so cute.  I also enjoy how the dialogue feels genuine Aussie, and not what Americans think they sound like. Could go on and on.  It is an absolute delight.\n\nI really enjoyed this Animal Crossing/Stardew/Minecraft hybrid, and I feel  this game has taken some of the best parts of those games and put them all together. It\u2019s super fun, addicting and the dev is awesome and listens to the community. \n\nIt\u2019s mind blowing how a single person can make a better game than anything s*at out by a AAA studio. Can\u2019t wait to see how it progresses!\n\n10/10 would recommend cooking shrimp on the barbie.", "timestamp_created": 1687804938, "timestamp_updated": 1687805131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 84, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595715701580047607", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140746194": {"recommendationid": "140746194", "author": {"steamid": "76561199142060366", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2282, "last_played": 1687807413}, "language": "english", "review": "f", "timestamp_created": 1687802675, "timestamp_updated": 1687802675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140741048": {"recommendationid": "140741048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000295832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 13694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1693507787}, "language": "english", "review": "bonza\n\nedit: okay had some good playtime in this so full review time\n\nPros; it's charming. the sound design is excellent, very soothing. Mechanics are mostly smooth. intuitive and simple to get to grips with. there's loads to do in the game with the variety of all the different types of collections keeping it from feeling too grindy. You can turn off the very annoying vocals/\n\nCons; saving is only when you end the day by going to sleep; not when the player wants it, which when the beta crashes can be annoying if you've done lots of things in the daytime and lose everything from the crash. \n\nWhat could make it amazing:\nEither an auto-save or mini-progress save i.e. it just saves the last thing you did, not the rewards bit (that can be as it is). \nChange the Drop to say Drop / Plant  - that would be super useful. Some actions have dual purposes which isn't necessarily clear from the outset. Some of these are fun to find, others are a PITA.\nA bit more info about what each licence gives you i.e. unlocks x y & z so then if you're trying to do something specific you don't waste credits on something you think might give you what you need only to be disappointed \n\nOverall this is a great game, I deeply enjoy the mechanics but the soundscape is what really really sells it.

You can fast forward it so that is a lot of clicks.\n[*]Tedious repetitive dialogues to do the same activity again and again. Un-necessary follow up conversation - like I just want to buy my license and be done or sell my item for the 3 millionth time, why do I have to listen to the same follow up conversation that I cannot just one-key-press escape. \n[*]Small small small map.\nMap is not built for transportation. Want to carry that Amber Chunk in your pocket? You can't - you can a whole engine that you found but you can't this particular item.\n\n[*]Planting seeds - I don't know if I am doing this wrong, but planting a tree goes as such 1.Dig a hole. 2. drop a seed 3.Plug that hole with soil. Now if you want to do this say 400 times for a big tree farm imagine doing that over an over.  You can try putting down multiple seeds but they can get clubbed together and when you pick up one you pick up both. And if you drop two seeds - it won't just plant one and leave one be instead it won't plant at all.\n[*]Game is not scaled to do massive projects. Want to expand the land? Or flatten it? Sure - you can do it one block at time. Which is fine - but your tool that degrades and eventually breaks if you over use it to the end. So better make 20 of these or just be ready to spend several days flattening a huge area. Or make 10 of those charging stations to keep cycling through them. \n[*]Again - Giant animals but not enough land to house them. Want to do a 100 wombat farm? You going to need a ton of land, but not for the animals silly. Its for the housing that shelters the animals.\n[*] The whole petting the animal nonsense. Not a fan even once you are in possession of the musical instrument.\n[*]Some tools break some you can recharge. Helmet - recharges does not break but any other powertool breaks? Why?\n[*]Sleep to save system. Did you enjoy flattening that 2 mile long area that took you long time to flatten? Great you were so excited that forgot that tool was about to at its last usage and broke? No worries just don't save and start over. Yes you will have to do that whole flattening again.\n[*]Flowers? Can we make colors out of this yet or not?\n[*]Bats - fun to kill. Till you keep getting hordes of them while mining. Even with two bat-zappers you will run out of them. The game's philosophy is progression = 10x of the same item.\nAnyway, spent ton of hours on this - but game still feels as tedious as it is on Day1 (IN-GAME) you would think after few years worth of days in game and pretty much unlocking everything it would be easier to do massive projects? But no. What is the end goal of this game if not that? It is not minecraft with procedural endless regeneration.\n\n[/olist]", "timestamp_created": 1687697080, "timestamp_updated": 1687697572, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490972369909286499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140668322": {"recommendationid": "140668322", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199339449", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 3186, "last_played": 1699783066}, "language": "english", "review": "absolutely lovely game! good, relaxing, open world game. loads to do or can just chill and work on your town <3", "timestamp_created": 1687692637, "timestamp_updated": 1687692637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140664899": {"recommendationid": "140664899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036233332", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4442, "last_played": 1688276386}, "language": "english", "review": "Most relaxing, yet satisfying game out there.", "timestamp_created": 1687687350, "timestamp_updated": 1687687350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140662232": {"recommendationid": "140662232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288060915", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_at_review": 6098, "last_played": 1700644627}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2611 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10\n------------------------\nThe PC version of animal crossing, minus the long real-life wait times. \nYou can keep customising your own village to your hearts desire and the one dev that is making this game keeps adding content to this game [b] and interacts with the community [/b].

The main interaction you will have with npcs is by completing request for them. \"bring me fish/food/furniture/clothing or can i buy this from you/do you want to buy this from me?\"\nRequests are worth it to get new items/blueprints, but you don't learn anything about the npcs by doing them. It also has a frustrating relationship decay mechanics.\n\nThen there's building. That's where the game shines. You can place npcs houses wherever you want, you can build wherever and whatever you want.

I would say it's 8.5/10 with the only things stopping it from being higher for me can mostly be boiled down to \"Early Access jank\". Detailed ramblings that resemble a review below.\n\nI am a veteran Harvest Moon, AC, Rune Factory etc player based in Australia. These games are my Vegemite (or I suppose, Mighty, in Dinkum's case) on toast. This game to me is worth full price right now with the amount of content it has, and with more major updates on the way. Obviously, it has its bugs and flaws as most Early Access games tend to, but most of the time, it's nothing making sure your saves are backed up won't fix.\n\nThe main thing that helps Dinkum stand out and shine is the setting for sure. Many people, Aussie and not, I've streamed the game for have said \"wow, this is exactly how I imagine a HarvestCrossing Australian Flavoured game to be\". While Dinkum isn't necessarily a \"lore heavy\" game like some others in the genre, I really like the little tidbits we hear about the world \"before things went South\" and about \"South City\" as we have people move to our island and befriend them. Essentially, the premise of Dinkum is the world has gone South (aka to Jackaroo Poo), and Fletch, an elderly woman, puts out an ad one day about a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get out of South City that you the player are the only one who takes interest in. She tells you about the island, which is where her father lived many years ago, and provides you his old journal (which functions as your \"achievement\" system and progression tracking namely) and you get on an airship and go from there!\n\nThe overall \"mechanics\" of the game are incredibly familiar with, but there are things like the licenses, and Franklyn's shop, that are distinct enough that it's hard for me to 1:1 compare Dinkum to another game mechanically, or for me to say that it feels \"too similar\" to another game. One thing I like and wish was more common in the Harvest Moon series is when you make meals at your cooking table, they all have certain unique buffs! These buffs both make it easier to do that action and also affect your EXP. For example, if a food has a sword and a shield icon in it, that means it buffs your attack and defense. On the note of combat, for anyone expecting the game to be combat heavy, you will likely be disappointed to hear the combat is fairly basic and not necessarily a required part of the game until you start getting into the endgame. But that doesn't bother me personally, if I want a more combat heavy game in the genre, I'll go play RF4 or SDV. My favourite part of the progression would have to be the things you unlock via Franklyn, especially things like the motorbike or helicopter (which is a cool 3 million dinks and many Shiny Disc sacrifices :P). Yes, you read that right, the money is literally called Dinks :D\n\nRegarding co-op/multiplayer, it can be a bit buggy and janky at certain points, but for the most part I like how it is. The only major gripe I have about it is if we want to pause, the only way to do that it seems is by ending the day (which for reference Dinkum days are about 30 mins irl time if you use the full day). Aside from that, I like the travel bag system (a \"global\" backpack for taking things to others islands) and the fact that it's easy to avoid getting burned if you're trading because of how the save system works (which is, the game only saves when you start a new day). I know some people have complaints it's not \"true\" co-op, in the sense of it isn't it's own separate save or mode, but rather you take your character and your items in your inventory and travel bag to someone's island, or they come to yours. However, you can still work on things for your own island on someone else's, such as your relationship/hearts progression with NPCs or doing things like bug catching, fishing, mining etc. etc. to work on your \"exp\" for those skills, so it's not like co-op not being hosted on your island is a detriment to you, especially because time won't progress on your island while you're on someone else's, it only progresses their day. I get the complaints and if this is a deal breaker for you that is understandable, given how games like SDV have much more refined co-op/multiplayer comparatively. At the same time it is only in Early Access, so this may change once the game releases, especially since the Developer has said he would like to work on bringing Dinkum to non-PC platforms once the game is officially \"done\" and released out of Early Access (this is in the FAQs on the community Discord). \n\nThe only negative for me personally is the fishing is a biiiit janky, which is a relatively common \"negative\" people cite. I actually preferred the old button mash system as a controller player though I understand the reasoning for the minor rework. The main reasons I wanted to call this out are because 1) fishing is how you get the current anniversary event currency, and 2) fishing one of the ways you can make a lot of Dinks, and is pretty easy to do so especially once you have the jetski and the Fishing Book from Theodore's Museum.

Yes, it has room for improvement, but I do not feel like a +1 in our island and yes I am the second player. I just did the first story quests in like 20 mins and then joined the other players island. I just cant place houses, but we can decide that together. I can still help pay the debt, bring the materials etc. I can't bring the people to the island, but we both do the tasks anyways so what does that matter really? Only real gripe I have is that I can't go into the mine alone and the NPC-s don't really react to me 5 staring them, felt like a bit of a waste of time going to max with them. We just built a guest house, and that's my house. I furnish it, I build around it, I live there. It works fantastically in coop, no problems whatsoever (except that villager friendship meter thing).\n\nSo take all of these 45 minutes played \"fake coop\" callers with a grain of salt, they barely played past the first story missions. At first I was a bit pissed as well, but I very quickly realised that I was not nearly as limited as I thought I was going to be.

I enjoyed my time with the game, but some problems are too big for me to ignored, and I hope they are fixed by the full release:\n1 - Please!!! make it so when you open a menu it paused the game. I don't want to have to go to the tittle screen every time I need to step away from the game and loose everything I did since the start of the day. And when I need to step away isn't always at night when I sleep. \n2 - Similarly, it's not okay that animals can attack me when I am in a cut scene. An alligator attack me when I was speaking with the grandma when we arrived on the island. I was also attacked when I was looking at the board with the demand or when I had just catch a bug and it played the cute animation. \n3 - I got no info on how to drive the wheelbarel so I was just confused until i try everything on my controler. I think leaving the player figure some things outs is nice, but I don't think this is one of them, since it is specific to this game and no one will instinctively know how to do it. \n\nOverall, this game will be great, but I think I will wait a bit so those issues are fixed and then played more. I hope the developpers are aware of the first two problems the most and fix it or the game will just be more annoying than fun for me. \n\nAlso, I played on the steam deck and got no problem specific to it I can recall, it was pretty smooth.", "timestamp_created": 1686864292, "timestamp_updated": 1686864292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140111051": {"recommendationid": "140111051", "author": {"steamid": "76561199206089751", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 348, "last_played": 1686913730}, "language": "english", "review": "lurve sangat this game", "timestamp_created": 1686850443, "timestamp_updated": 1686850443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140108915": {"recommendationid": "140108915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102891764", "num_games_owned": 446, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1686406016}, "language": "english", "review": "Philly has lost his mind to this game and thinks he owns an island", "timestamp_created": 1686847886, "timestamp_updated": 1686847886, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140107742": {"recommendationid": "140107742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401259025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1658793841}, "language": "english", "review": "This isn't a game with \"Animal Crossing vibes.\" It is a word-for-word copy of Animal Crossing New Horizons in terms of storyline and is disappointingly lacking in gameplay features.

The simplicity in the game ui & character controls makes it easy to pick up and hard to put down. You can lose many hours of your life in this game and not regret a single second of it.\nI'm a particularly a big fan of the animals and interactions with them the game offers. So many other games of this nature go for fantasy or more western animals so to play with Australian animals is refreshing and just as adorable as usual. Pick up a guitar and -bam- you've got the cutest audience for your little performance. \nThe game doesn't hold back when it comes to the survival elements, a backpack full of grub is often needed to get from one place to another. Angry critters will run after you too, I find the encounters engaging but never too difficult for me to manage. \nOverall, Dinkum is chock full of endearing qualities all put together in a bright and eye-catching graphic design, James has done a truly wonderful job creating this game. There are things that could be improved but this game is in early access so I'll give it the benefit of \"maybe eventually it will all work out\"\nFor a game that is very new it runs very smoothly and with few bugs, I can safely say it's one of the best early access games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.\n\nHere's where we get to the *but*...\nWhilst I would recommend the game I'd advise extreme caution when engaging with the online Dinkum community. I met some of the most amazing people and truly felt I'd found somewhere I belonged, but it was short lived. I was one of a group of people accused of being \"too helpful\" and was very confused and upset. When I did eventually gather myself and make a heartfelt apology I was responded to with a message that started \"I'm not reading that\" and then banned. I'm still under the belief that there was severe misunderstanding and miscommunication from both myself & the admin team but this thing isn't what upsets me the most. When I say I met amazing people I do truly mean it, and those amazing people were also cut off and bullied out of the server. I've heard some horrible things about what happens behind the scenes and the bias certain people show towards others, I have seen messages from the community manager that I would never expect anyone to send let alone somebody in charge of a massive network of gamers (some of which were/are incredibly vulnerable). With all of this some of our friends reached out to James himself and he made it clear that he supports the actions of this CM and so I feel I cannot support the game anymore.\nI loved this game, adored it, I put so much of myself into it and dedicated myself to helping others wherever I could, but now when I even look at it in my games menu I feel sick to the core. Not only was it an extremely traumatic and upsetting time for me but the way that my friends and other community members have been treated upsets me greatly. \nA game as beautiful and accepting as this should have a community that reflects that, instead it's caused harm to a group of people who were only trying to help and engage. \nDownload the game, have the most amazing time because I promise you 100% you will.

Comparing it to the other games listed above, all the items have a purpose, there's more to craft, you can explore your island in different ways, there's lots of animals to take care of or hunt, and so much more. There's no way you can rush through this game. \n\nIf you like decorating and is concerned about filling your island up too fast, don't worry! Your island is MASSIVE! There's so much land to explore that you couldn't finish decorating or laying everything out within a short period of time. There's also lots of recipes and items to discover as well as visitors to bring to your island.\n\nOne of my favourite things is DInkum's online co-op. You can have up to 4 players per island, AND there's no restriction to what you and your friends can do on each other islands. It's a great help especially when you go down to the mines, need to fight an alpha or even to get materials around the island. \n\nOverall, for the price of this game it is well worth your money.

It's hard to stop playing sometimes. There's a lot to like about this game, and there are also some areas that could use improvement. Below are some points I hope are implemented.\n\n1: Manual Save Functionality - Probably the only real annoyance I have is that the only way to save the game (aside from using the debug console cheats) is by sleeping to end the day. Often I will do the \"morning routine\" of watering crops, tending to animals, getting the NPC daily tasks, etc., which will usually take until mid-afternoon. There's still a lot of time left in the day to go into the deep mines, go out and collect materials, etc., but I sometimes will be pulled away or just want to stop, and I have to choose between just ending the day there or redoing it all. I strongly believe there should be a way to save the game without ending the day.\n\n2: Bugs and Fish in Containers - I feel that bugs and fish should be able to be stored in containers. It was annoying to have to go get a specific one when an NPC requested it, when I had previously caught it and had to sell/drop it to make room (this was before learning you can place them on the ground. However, this still gets cluttered when you have a lot of them, and it can get hard to tell which is which). Perhaps special containers can be locked behind licenses or bought from Franklyn or Julia.\n\n3: Crafting and Automation - Some of the first mods I look for in games with crafting systems are mods for inventory management and crafting automation. By the end of the first in-game year, I had a lot of chests, and just one day in the deep mines could net up to 200 ore. I think it could be satisfying to have some options for improved crafting and processing. Perhaps some Franklyn commissions for a special crafting table that pulls from boxes that are in specific squares, special boxes that feed into adjacent production items, etc.\n\n4: Wheelbarrow - I think the wheelbarrow has extremely limited uses currently. It is nice if you want to transport dirt a small distance, but that usually isn't something I've needed, and by the time I did, I had the dirt printer. I think if the wheelbarrow could place its contents in the square in front of it one at a time, it could serve as a nice in-between before you have the dirt printer, and it would have a lot more utility.\n\n5: Silos - Placing animal feed into silos should require a single click to place the entire stack you're holding. There is no reason to place them one at a time, and it is tedious to have to click 200 times to completely fill one. Even just topping one off after a few days of use kind of defeats the purpose of it automatically filling the feeders if you have to click the same number of times anyway.\n\n6: Crab Pots - Currently, crab pots feel pretty disappointing. Being locked behind the 3000 perk point fishing license and requiring a total of 35 ore *per pot* is a lot. Then, each requires some meat to bait every day (which really adds up when you make a lot of them), and each only catches a single item per day, which is usually a common item you could get a bunch of anyway.

And well Animal Crossing is rather boring, just by watching it. With Dinkum, you have slower progression, but it feels just quick enough for you to learn the game. Sure, not everything is explained, but sometimes the people you talk to will give you advice that helps. I could see how some people might not enjoy the slower progression if they like to min/max etc., but I like it. I haven't felt rushed, even when I feel like I'm not doing all that much. I know I could be doing more with my days, but there is no rush. Just sit back and chill, unless you're in the mine ofc. \nOh and before I forget, so far it has the best fishing experience I've had in a game that isn't just a fishing game. It's closer to a realistic experience and I love it.  Actually my favourite thing to do.\nI highly recommend this game if you love chill games.

The multiplayer feature was top-notch, and I encountered no bugs throughout my gameplay. The graphics and sound were impressive and added to the overall enjoyment of the game.\n\nDinkum is a fun game that kept me engaged for hours on end. The controls were easy to learn, and the gameplay was smooth and seamless. The multiplayer mode was particularly enjoyable, as I was able to team up with other players and take on challenges together. It added a whole new level of excitement and strategy to the game.\n\nOne of the things I appreciated most about Dinkum was the attention to detail. The graphics were well-designed, and the sound effects were spot on. The game truly transports you to a different world, immersing you in the gameplay and making you feel like you're part of the action.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Dinkum to anyone looking for a fun and engaging game to play. It's well-designed, has great graphics and sound, and the multiplayer mode is top-notch. After playing for 16 hours, I can confidently say that Dinkum is one of the best games I've played in a long time.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1682985320, "timestamp_updated": 1682985320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137640739": {"recommendationid": "137640739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268788824", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 969, "last_played": 1686235520}, "language": "english", "review": "idk how but Dinkum mixes just the right amount of farming, exploring, surviving and building a new island in a way that doesnt overwhelm me like most games do, and that hooks me so bad...\nalso I am on the verge of becoming an addict", "timestamp_created": 1682972749, "timestamp_updated": 1682972749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137637226": {"recommendationid": "137637226", "author": {"steamid": "76561199182771083", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1151, "last_played": 1685599693}, "language": "english", "review": "Wahoo!", "timestamp_created": 1682968599, "timestamp_updated": 1687808421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137636410": {"recommendationid": "137636410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141034567", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1699, "last_played": 1685026900}, "language": "english", "review": "Rooroopoo", "timestamp_created": 1682967635, "timestamp_updated": 1682967635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137632797": {"recommendationid": "137632797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044343661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1558, "last_played": 1683396148}, "language": "english", "review": "Animal Crossing + jump attacks...a solid souls-like.", "timestamp_created": 1682963901, "timestamp_updated": 1682963901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137614562": {"recommendationid": "137614562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232719112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 12185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 483, "playtime_at_review": 1401, "last_played": 1700255436}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: I've put a few more hours into this game, and am still enjoying it.

The master volume slider starts at around 30%, which is fantastic - can every game be like this please?\n\nRegarding the 'recommendation' for this game - I am refunding it; it's not one I see myself playing in the long term (plus the sounds were really bothering me). That said..\n\ntl;dr : It tries its hardest to be Animal Crossing, but just isn't - though it certainly feels like it's well on that path. Maybe with some quality-of-life updates it can get a lot closer, but - wasn't for me. To be fair, I was never the biggest Animal Crossing player to begin with - so if you were, it may be more palatable.\n\nGood:\n(1) Serious Animal Crossing [Switch]/Nintendo vibes - if you enjoyed that game, this one is very likely up your alley - at least with regards to the graphics/ui/overall feel of the game off the bat.\n\nBad:\n(1) The sound effects - the developers sure love their extremely high-pitched/grating sounds, for everything. List: [UI menu clicks for everything/Pickaxe mining sound/even the occasional footstep sound] - they're all just... incredibly irritating, like nails on a chalkboard.\n(2) The inventory system - like Animal Crossing, it offers a toolbar+backpack organization of your items. That itself isn't bad, but - unlike Animal Crossing, there is no rotating through your backpack/toolbars - there's only a singular bar you can put things on. I found myself CONSTANTLY having to open up the backpack and move things around, which as a controller player was just time-consuming/obnoxious. Seriously, just do it the way Animal Crossing [Switch] does, and it'd feel SO much better.\n(3) Selling items - there's no way to see how much each item sells for, as a single unit, or as a stack; when you hover over your items at a merchant, or try to find them in the informational menus. You select everything you want to sell, and John just gives you a price - that's it. I'm sure I could sell him one item at a time and note how much each thing sells for - but come on, that's unrealistic.", "timestamp_created": 1682906264, "timestamp_updated": 1682906421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137590032": {"recommendationid": "137590032", "author": {"steamid": "76561199147239094", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3042, "last_played": 1688192421}, "language": "english", "review": "It reminds me a lot of Animal Crossing, but actually challenging.

panales o las conchas grandes sobre la cabeza, si tenemos un sombrero colocado se nota mucho el efecto entre los modelos, siendo el m\u00e1s notorio con el sombrero de copa.\n\n2.- Opciones graficas:

There's several issues with the game that modders fortunately solved. God bless the modding community, I tell ya.\n\nThe game has good regional pricing (for the most part)\n\nCons: The game only has a singular save file AND the game ONLY saves when you go to sleep at the end of the day. Now, considering that you can spend upwards of 30minutes on a single day, this means that if the game were to crash at any time during the day, then you lose ALL that progress made during the day and lose all loot. And since the game crashes every so often, that means you're going to lose hours of gameplay if you invest any meaningful amount of time into playing the game. The dev could easily fix this by implementing a save system that ISN'T straight out of the year 1995.\n\nA single butterfly/spider/etc. takes up a whole inventory slot, but you can have 20 engines on 1 inventory slot. Makes sense?\n\nBecause of the above inventory stacking design decision, the inventory is far too small, and it rightfully should be increased by at least 10 spaces.\n\nWeapons/Tools/etc. break when they reach zero durability, meaning you lose them forever.\n\nYour stamina/energy bar comes 1/10th of the size when you go past 00:00 at night, and you LOSE all stamina that you had above that line. A [u]MUCH[/u] better mechanic would be to instead simply not allow the player to recoup their stamina after the 00:00 time.\n\nBats in the mines don't give any loot, ever. They're the only thing in the game that doesn't give loot AND they're the only thing in the game that can't be hit by weapons in a straight forward fashion. Two things that make no sense in the logic of the game.\n\nThere's some special animals in the game, like Radioactive Crocs for instance, but these animals give no special loot besides the regular Croc loot.

Here's why (after 52 hours of play)\nIt will be a long speech, in which I will explain some details and say the missing things\n\nThe movement of the camera is unique in this game and smooth, and the smoothness of the game even in entering and exiting buildings at high speed without a loading screen is a beautiful thing that I cannot describe accurately\n\nThe graphics of the game are beautiful and cartoony, not exaggerated, such as trying to reach realism, because games always fail in that, except rarely\n\nEveryone in the city has special interests and also different working times, and you can chat with them and give you advice or tell their life stories (the dialogues will be special at the beginning of the game and become repeated later), and you can befriend any individual and go out with them, but before that you must carry out several tasks for them in order for the love meter to increase And they become your friends, but their programming is not good. Unfortunately, I sometimes have problems with them, such as delay in reactions.\n\nIn short, the game will be excellent, like the first 30, 40, 50, or 60 hours, after which you will notice a lack of activities and repetition of tasks, but it is not a big problem, especially since the game is early access.\n\nHere are the missing things that I wish were present in the game\n\nThe map becomes larger and more diverse, and there are different cities in it that you cannot modify. You only deal with them, such as trading or buying from their stores, and their products are different from those of your city, so that you are encouraged to go to them.\n\nMore diversity in environments, changing the desert from red to beige, adding a snowy and mountainous area and a green area\n\nWhen winter came, I wished that the land, trees, and buildings would be covered with snow, and the lighting of the game would change to be more white, and in the fall, the leaves would fall and fill the land, and the sunlight would be orange\n\nAdd more wild animals such as bears, lions, hyenas, etc\n\nAdding legendary animals whose sizes are larger and more difficult to hunt, and that there is a shop that buys the skins or heads of these animals from you at high prices to encourage hunting them and their places differ such as land, seas and sky, on land, for example, there will be a bear, and in the sea, for example, it will be Megaldon, and in the sky will be the eagle\n\nAdding a larger and wider aquatic life, and the possibility of buying a diving suit or a submarine to explore it, or to catch more or larger fish\n\nAdding more modifications to the houses, more colors, and adding a garage\n\nAdd NPCs Interact in town\n\nAdding more mini games, for example, an arcade game store, or any fun side activity\n\nAdding dinosaur fossils to the museum, and the bones are collected and restored by the player\n\nI apologize for the prolongation. The bottom line is that the game has great potential, and the more developers are interested in their game, the more and more the success of the game will be.
