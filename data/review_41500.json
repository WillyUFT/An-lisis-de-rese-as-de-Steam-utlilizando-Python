It does not stand the test of time to gameplay or even a purposeful storyline (big bad is evil and will destroy town of people you hardly interact with). It is VERY simple, and that's fine, but I'd rather be playing Baldur's Gate 1 rather than this as in my playthrough as a Vanquisher, I was able to go through the whole thing with one special attack and a smattering of points abilities to other places. I finished it on Hard, the loot was a bit meh and didn't really level up to where I was at the time, and the mob rushes just became a case of 'oh here we go again, run away, turn and shoot, run away, turn and shoot'. \n\nSo, I found it boring. Which is terrible for a game but there you go. With Diablo you don't even have to play the game without knowing that the writers have invested heavily into game lore as they were going along with it. So for Torchlight I'd play it for the mindlessness of it inbetween playing something else as well. The background music isn't bad at least though, so that's something.

Just don't expect an actual Diablo or Titan Quest out of this. Also, the balance is pretty whack, see below for a sanity-saving tip: \n\nSo the game suggests to play on hard if you're an ARPG veteran. Fair enough. But, what it doesn't tell you is that you will encounter enemies that will simply two-shot and even one-shot you on a regular basis. You will die, a lot. Despite having tons of potions on you. And the punishment for death gets really steep later on.

This is a game heavily inspired by a previous ARPG known as 'Fate' where you dove into a town dungeon with a pet companion. The huge difference is that while Fate was random generation, Torchlight decided to make a standardized experience for Players with non-randomized Bosses, Floors, and Quests. Overall I'm still fond of starting the game and going through the first couple of floors however it's as the game continues that it starts to become a chore. This is a game I've quit multiple times and just never brought myself to finish, and here I am again not finishing the game for one final time.\n\n\nOn level up the Player is given three stat points to distribute between Strength, Dexterity, Magic, and Block. Strength is exclusive to Melee Damage, Dexterity to Ranged Damage, Magic to Elemental Damage, and Block to Physical Damage Absorption. The only way to obtain Elemental Damage Absorption is through item resistances. Also on leveling either by XP or FAME (Earned by killing Champions), the player is given a Talent point. Of the three classes in Torchlight there are MANY overlapping skills in the Talent Tree as any Passive is shared between Classes. There are 15 Passive Skills out of 30-33 Skills and Passives ultimately being skills you are forced to take like +Critical Chance. The Talent Tree is level locked and each Talent can be upgraded 10 times each. A majority of these skill points are regulated to the Passive Skills as you'll only use 1-2 Actives. Outside of this there are General Skills that any class can learn such as: Summons, Heals, Fireball/Ice Shard, and Offensive/Defensive Buffs. Concerning builds this results in most people running the same General Skills + Passives with the only flavor being whichever Active Talent Skill you choose to spam.\n\n\nAs this is an ARPG of course there are items with multiple rarities and sets. You'll find that Legendary Items do no massive change to any playstyle, simply being a stronger item. Items can be enchanted with a ~2% debuff chance (increasing on success) that purges the item, not including the %chance of failure without debuff. I take issue with this feature as I've had multiple items be purged on the first attempt, the very FIRST one. There are also consumables like Fish and Potions. Fish have temporary effects like increasing resistances or experience gain. Potions are the age-old heal or restore mana.\n\n\nAs the game proceeds the levels begin to grow in size but the layouts and enemies are becoming more and more annoying. Playing on Very Hard it became a chore as enemies with instant abilities hiding in corners results in Player passivity and makes each floor take even longer to complete. The Dark Zealot is a game ruining enemy that plagues the late-game but it's best if we just go to the list of complaints:\n\n\n- Enemy abilities are ridiculous to the nth degree as they can instantly trigger their abilities which make them unavoidable for the player. This is especially bad on certain spawns where you can have LOTS of these enemies in a closed location that you have to walk into. Which means you walk into a room, or over a bridge, or upstairs and die instantly.\n\n\n- Dark Zealots are absolutely busted with three spells: poison bolts, summon skeletons, and the most important: lightning bolt aka goodbye world of the living. There doesn't seem to be a CD on these abilities and they can use them more than once in a row. The issue is that the lightning bolt does around 1-2k damage but they can also CRIT on this ability and do ~3.5k. My character had 1.6k HP and for reference there is NO health scaling through Talents or Attributes, only Items that CAN have +### HP. \n\n\nSo okay we need Lightning Resistances to survive right? Well wait! Elemental Resistances are a FLAT amount and to try and cover for the crit damage... it'd require that we have ~2k Lightning Resistance. So okay I'm just being a moron right? Surely? Well let me look at my legendary equipment: +30 Lightning Resistance. Let's suppose I manage to get +30 Lightning Resistance on ALL of my items (10), which means 300 total. Okay we're nowhere close. Well let's say I manage to Socket all 10 item slots with 2 gems (20) AND I manage to get the best quality/rarity of gem (Eternal: +28 Resist) AND I use the Elemental Resistance Skill at max level (+47): I'd have a grand total of 907. Do you get it yet? Sure at this amount I'd manage to survive the normal Lightning Bolt, but IF the enemy ever crits it's a insta-kill. Which I have to reiterate that obtaining ANY of the items or gems like I'd suggested is near impossible. At the point of fighting Ordrak (Final Boss) I STILL did not have a single Eternal gem of any type. So getting 20 of those gems of a specific type or let alone getting 2 sockets on all the armor pieces (with the highest lightning resist roll + having health increases) is complete insanity. But wait wait wait, I still haven't gotten to the best part:\n\n\nTHESE DARK ZEALOTS ARE A NORMAL SPAWN. \n\n\nJust let that sink in for a bit. They can spawn in groups and do more damage on average than the Champion version of the same type. The only advice I saw in years of this game being released is to either pray for a projectile deflect% or silence them before they can cast (which again they can be off-screen and cast as soon as they're in range). What an absolute shit enemy that ruins the game. The best argument is to go into Health and try to out-scale the damage but again you can only find health gains through Item Stats which is entirely RNG.\n\n\n- Bosses are agonizing (Very Hard Difficulty) as their health is bloated. Ordrak for example can infinitely spawn enemies for ever and ever and after fighting the boss for ~10-15 minutes, I'd only done around 4-5% of his total health-bar. This is coming immediately after Alric (who can ALSO spawn infinite enemies) that I was forced to kill with a melee weapon because for some godforsaken reason, the Devs decided to give him a skill that gave him and all of his minions immunity to any ranged attack. So I was able to easily kill Alric with a trashy merchant item and the boss in the immediate next floor is practically un-killable WITH my proper legendary weapon because of his health being 20x bigger? I don't get it. I thought maybe Ordrak had a special mechanic I was missing but it's just a straight slog. Going off the Torchlight Wiki, a majority of the bosses don't even have weaknesses with most having ~120% to all resistance and armor.\n\n\n- Ranged Mechanics don't function properly with the Z-Axis and there's a LOT of bridges/stairs. If an enemy is on the stairs right in front of you, you WILL shoot over them. If you try shooting UP the stairs you will instead simply hit the stairs. The only solution is to stand ON the bridge/stairs or try and lure the enemy away. Considering that approaching certain enemies will cause them to use their ability, neither one are practical. Even AoE abilities have a seemingly random chance of being successful on the Z-Axis, as it feels much more minimal in Z-Axis scaling than the X and Y.\n\n\n- Bad level design on the bridge maps + lava and onward. The start of the game in the caverns then to castle type isn't so bad with straightforward hallways and rooms with clutter. Then you get to the infinite bridges... and thousands upon thousands of staircases. Let me reiterate again that any amount of Z-Axis if using ranged attacks. Not only that but your pet and summons will also get stuck or lost somewhere in the labyrinth. It's not fun or fair and I've never wanted levels to end so quickly. I think in nearly EVERY play-through I've done, these maps are the so to speak 'run killers'. Where I stop playing because the level just kept going and going and there's like 5 more floors of this trash and the fun is just bottoming out.\n\n\n- Enemies can sometimes be invisible because their model didn't load in.", "timestamp_created": 1689094736, "timestamp_updated": 1689096555, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454017430543899536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141832299": {"recommendationid": "141832299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060731110", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 1366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1692042439}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my favourite Diablo style Arpg.\n\nEven better than Diablo 2 on some days.

It just adds extra clicking and hurts your small inventory even more...\n\nAlso, apparently magic damage is from your weapons/spells doing magic damage, not from actually choosing to do magic yourself, like choosing the mage.

While the graphics didn't initially capture my attention, I found the game to be incredibly fun and addictive, with a deep level of character customization and an engaging loot system.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about Torchlight was the variety of character classes and skills available. Each of the three classes - the Destroyer, Alchemist, and Vanquisher - has their own unique skill tree, which allowed me to customize my character to suit my playstyle. I loved experimenting with different builds and seeing how they would fare in battle.\n\nAnother thing that stood out to me was the game's loot system. Finding rare and powerful gear was always exciting, and the pet system added an interesting twist. My pet could hold additional items, and I could even send it back to town to sell things while I continued adventuring.\n\nWhile the game's graphics may not be the most impressive, they still do a good job of conveying the game's charming art style. The game's environments are detailed and varied, with each level offering new challenges and surprises. The boss fights are especially impressive, with each one requiring a unique strategy to defeat.\n\nOverall, I had a great time playing Torchlight and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and addictive action RPG.

I beat this on NORMAL at level 35, and the difficulty spikes get a little off during the last handful of levels. The final boss takes an absurdly long amount of time to beat. Maybe I could've grinding out more levels. \n\nThe loot system gets pretty off near the end of the game as well. I was level 35, and some level 17 gear was better than the stuff I was finding on the bottom floors, which was still well below my level. I feel like most of my equipment was found by 2/3rds of the way through the game. In a 'loot' based game, that's just off. \n\nBut still, game is beat, I stand by saying - \"get it on a deep sale, and only if you love ARPGs.\" \n\n\nBefore I talk about the game - \n\nSteam needs to make their recommendation system more nuanced. Instead of a simple 'yes' or 'no', maybe add 'yes, but only on sale', which is exactly where this game falls. \n\nI'd also say, deep sale, don't spend more than $5-$10 for this, and $10 is pushing it. \n\nHere's why - \n\nPROS: The music and general ambiance are really well done. It's got kind of a fairy tale feel, with a slight bit of spookiness to it, and the aged graphics aren't such an eyesore since they're cartoonish to begin with. The gameplay is standard ARPG. Controls are as you'd expect, and the game is more of a mellow out feel, and not really a stress on challenge. \n\nThe thing is, this game is extremely basic, but charming. Now we'll get to the cons, cause there are a lot. \n\nCONS: \n\nSo yes, this game is almost 15 years old, but feels even older. For a game that's primarily a loot driven style, they really made some questionable choices on the loot system, and then there are just some terrible mechanics. \n\nFirst, the gear doesn't vary much in visuals, which is a crux of these kinds of games. Get ready for your character to have the same look for every 10 or so levels. Superficial, yeah, but still, I like to see the incremental equipment growth of my character - from a new adventurer, wearing the basics, to more of a mixed bag, to eventually getting sets together, and finally to looking like a demigod. This transition is really slow here. \n\nThe WORST offender is inventory management in general. You're given a very limited number of slots, and just about everything you find is 'unidentified'. Meaning you need to carry a ton of identify scrolls (another slot used), and use one on every item you find. It just feels like they dropped the ball on how that was supposed to work. You find the identify scrolls everywhere, so it's not an issue of managing them - which makes this even more puzzling. \n\nAlso, the skill tree is really bare bones, so don't expect much noticeable growth, aside from just doing more damage and taking more hits. \n\nVERDICT: \n\nIf you're an ARPG fan, and you like games with strong ambiance, this will probably entertain you for a while, but again, it's not really more than a $5 game. I think it's on sale all the time though, which is why I said 'yes' I would recommend. \n\nTORCHLIGHT II fixes almost every issue, and still has that same great feel, so if you're choosing between the two of them, there's no reason to choose the first. If you've played part 2, and are wondering if part 1 is worth it, then I'd say you'll probably appreciate it, but you'll really see how they improved the mechanics in the sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1678162802, "timestamp_updated": 1687773004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134155794": {"recommendationid": "134155794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085141170", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 767, "last_played": 1466744301}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo infravalorado.

On one hand, it isn't a terrible game; it's actually not bad at all. On the other hand, I feel I would likely have had more fun scraping my skull against concrete than I did playing [i]Torchlight[/i].\n\n[i]Torchlight[/i] is, for all intents and purposes, a starter dungeon-crawler. Between its cartoon design aesthetic, its simplistic plot, its very rudimentary class/skill system, and the bombardment of mostly useless item drops, the game is, at its core, perfectly designed for somebody who hasn't played this style of game but wants a palatable experience that consists entirely of empty calories. Regardless of how you approach this title, it really doesn't leave much of a lasting impression outside of the fact that its plot is silly and the game-play is incredibly repetitive. That isn't really a bad thing though.\n\nThe entire story takes place in the titular town of [i]Torchlight[/i], or more accurately in a nonsensical sprawling dungeon beneath said titular town. You, the player, and your trusty pet are tasked with following a generic and forgettable NPC into some mines that lead to a plethora of seemingly unrelated but somehow interconnected dungeon floors to stop some sort of corruption from an otherwise generic bad guy whose name escapes me because it really isn't important. It's simple, very bland, and mostly there to give some sort of narration where none would have sufficed and still remained cohesive.\n\nNow, my biggest complaint about this title is that it made 13 hours feel like it went on way longer than it had any right to. For such a relatively simple game, I felt as though the repetitive nature of the game turned into a slog about an hour in. Be that a result of faulty difficulty tweaking, the fact that most of the enemies are just reskinned versions of the same enemies you face on floors above, or that I don't have the stamina to repeatedly slap myself in the face with a keyboard to produce the same affect that could be had by not playing this title, I honestly couldn't tell you. Either way I'm dealt the dilemma of establishing whether I'd recommend this title, and for some twisted reason I feel like I should, if only to offer an easy entry into this particular game style. Perhaps I just need more sleep.

While you can do additional maps after completing the game, its not really needed to do unless you want more hack and slash action. Doing a lot of these in a row tends to become repetitive as the rooms start to become the same just with random enemy types.

Pero la traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol es floja: c\u00f3mo van a poner \"senial\" en vez de \"se\u00f1al\" o \"extranio\" en vez de \"extra\u00f1o\". Se ve que la persona que tradujo no ten\u00eda la tecla \u00f1 en el teclado, encima faltan acentos!! ten\u00eda un teclado ingl\u00e9s? :O\n- El jefe final est\u00e1 muy desbalanceado. Le pusieron 50 millones de puntos de vida y encima no para de invocar esbirros. No esta equilibrado comparado con el resto del juego. Encima se me colg\u00f3 dos veces en la final cuando nunca hab\u00eda tenido un problema en el juego y tuve casi que hacer todo de vuelta, digo casi porque el jefe no ten\u00eda toda la vida completa por suerte.\n- Las misiones secundarias son todas las mismas, por ejemplo: te piden buscar a un determinado jefe para que lo mates, una determinada piedra de Ember o un determinado objeto de un escenario que te abren con un portal.\n- Cuando la mascota regresa de vender siempre aparece un molesto cartel que nos avisa que la mascota regreso. Hac\u00eda falta poner el cartel? digo, no? porque que aparezca en medio de un combate es un poco molesto.\n- Si tengo al personaje usando una pistola \u00e9ste cuando agarra un escudo o un bast\u00f3n de una mano lo equipa en la otra mano de forma autom\u00e1tica. Esta mal. Eso lo quiero hacer yo de forma manual si quiero.\n- A veces puede pasar que si volvemos a un escenario que hayamos limpiado \u00e9ste se regenere y vuelvan a aparecer los monstruos. En cambio, otras veces no. En que quedamos?\n- Por m\u00e1s que nuestra mascota tenga una poci\u00f3n en su inventario no la toma de forma autom\u00e1tica cuando la necesita, no queda otra que darle la poci\u00f3n de forma manual para que la beba.\n- Eso de que la tiradora o el guerrero puedan invocar esqueletos, zombies o lanzar bolas de fuego con ayuda de los pergaminos como si fueran magos como que no da.\n- El hechizo \"Invocar espada flameante\" lo toma como hechizo ofensivo. Esta mal, en realidad es un hechizo de invocaci\u00f3n.\n- No hay un atributo para aumentar la vida o el man\u00e1. Directamente sube a medida que sube el personaje de nivel.\n- El logro \u201cHat Trick\u201d nos dice que ganemos el juego con las tres clases. Sin embargo, apenas me cree la clase que me faltaba para probar salto el logro :O\n- Se repiten muchos dise\u00f1os de mini-jefes, cambian el nombre, pero en apariencia son id\u00e9nticos. \n- No aparecen los atributos de la mascota ni tampoco tiene habilidades para mejorar.\n- El minimapa no pone nombres de personajes ni leyendas de los iconos.\n- La mascota la verdad que la matan r\u00e1pido, no sirve de mucho para pelear :D\n- La traducci\u00f3n no est\u00e1 completa, hay partes que est\u00e1n en ingles todav\u00eda.\n- No se le puede decir a la mascota que compre pociones o pergaminos.\n- El Destructor en espa\u00f1ol tiene la voz de Loquendo hahaha\n- El inventario del personaje y de la mascota es muy chico\n- No se puede ordenar el inventario autom\u00e1ticamente.\n- No se puede crear un personaje hardcore.\n- No se pueden cambiar los controles.\n- Poca variedad de enemigos.\n- No tiene multijugador.", "timestamp_created": 1664798639, "timestamp_updated":

I can't really recommend this thing to anyone (unless you want to get acquainted with it for its historic value.) \n\nI'll start with the negatives.\n\n- Scaling.\nThe scaling in this game is busted. As you progress through levels and gear, so does the world of Torchlight. You move at the samey pace until you hit levels 20 and higher. You see, the damage scaling affects both physical and magical damage of the enemies. While it's easy to equip better gear and invest into your defense stat to mitigate the physical side of things, obtaining good magic resistance may prove to be extremely troublesome. Combined with the fact that Zealot mages cast a hitscan ability that cannot be dodged, you can see how frustrating progressing through later parts of the game and/or crypt can be. One way to gain resistance is gems, but gems suck.\n\n- Gems\nGems are an upgrade system designed to help you out and allow you some creativity in customizing your gear. However, their droprates and upgrade system were designed poorly. Most of the time you pick up the worst kind of a gem and in order to upgrade it a tier you have to combine 2. You do it again to get to another tier, and to get a decent gem you need to spend a lot of time fishing the trader in the town and hoping that you get some on your journey. Furthermore, you get into this psychological trap where you don't want to use your gems on items because the items are kind of good and socketing them right now would be a waste. \n- Enchanting\nEnchanting has this frustrating thing where it has a chance to disenchant your item. Let's say you get a nice set piece and you want to keep it for the set bonus. In order for the item not to fall off, you need to upgrade it through gems and enchanting. You might get struck by bad luck and instead of adding some effects to the item, you'll remove EVERY SINGLE ENCHANT from the item. And there's no way to control what enchantments you get. It's purely random. \n- Item sets\nI've never obtained a full set armour in my 150 hours of play (I've had some playtime on a pirated copy before buying it here). It's just too random and wild. The only possible way is to put the items from the set into a shared stash and maybe, potentially, you can collect one though multiple playthroughs. \n- Some abilities feel unfinished \nPrimary specs for each class feel awesome. Vanq is your designated ranged character, Destroyer is your melee character, Alchemist is your mage. Sounds good. Let's say you get bored with playing ranged Vanquisher, you want to try out the traps. Tough luck, they do not scale with anything in your kit, not your weapon DPS, not your stats. By investing points into those abilities you cripple your character, especially on harder difficulties. These abilities are just there. Same can be said about many abilities that characters have. This limits the replayability pretty much. \n\nHowever, there is that one broken thing in the game that can help you overcome any obstacle and that is inheritance. \n\nThe way inheritance works in this game is that it allows you to pass one item to your next character once you finish the game. The thing is, once you hit level 2/3, the item gets its stats upgraded. If you have damage enchant on that item, the damage will increase, you get the idea. Long story short, on my Nth playthrough I upgraded my ring so much that the health digits on it went into the negatives and it would kill me every single time I tried to ressurect.\n\nThis is a good prototype of a better game, Torchlight 2.

The constant threat of enemies pulling OHKO attacks out of nowhere, or entering a new level directly into a group of enemies that immediately attack you to the same effect due to poor randomization, turns the prospect of progressing further and preparing for HC into an RNG-fest that I'm simply not interested in wasting hundreds of hours on. I tried some rebalance mods that helped for a time, but they don't fix the randomization issues leading to stacked enemy attacks, the broken armor/block/resistances system that doesn't allow you to compensate in any way for the above, or the extremely punishing respawn system that basically ensures you'll either be grinding even more through the game's atrociously limited map pool (if you respawn back at town) or will never have enough gold to purchase anything but a few potions after a certain point (if you respawn at the beginning of the level).\n\n[i]I have also read that Torchlight II has similar issues with enemy damage spikes and OHKOs, so I'll be skipping that game as well. I understand it's beloved by its community, and please understand if you're a fan that I wanted to like these games, but I am not the kind of player that can turn a blind eye to these sorts of flaws in a game. I like to complete my games 100% with all achievements to explore them to the fullest, and if a game is designed to punish you in unavoidable ways with the loss of dozens of hours of progress, or (in my estimation in the case of TL) is not playtested to ensure that players won't be destroyed in spite of doing everything correctly, then it's not worth the considerable investment of my time required to see everything it has to offer. Plain and simple.[/i]\n\n[b]ORIGINAL REVIEW[/b]:\nI'll write a more detailed review once I complete the game, but as of right now it's going to be a negative review, for a couple of reasons:\n\n1) The game is *incredibly* poorly tuned. It plays like the developers were aiming for an easy casual take on Diablo, kind of like the old FATE series, and thus tuned the Normal difficulty setting to suit an easy-breezy casual game. Then, they messed around a bit with the numbers for the other difficulty settings, then shipped without actually playing them. The result is a game that is borderline unplayable as a melee character after a certain point on Very Hard difficulty, due to an insane number of OHKO's that can't be dodged. Add to that the fact that the armor system in the game is a simple flat damage reduction, making it practically useless compared to just stacking health and resistances, something the game never tells you until it's slamming you with OHKO attacks towards the end of Very Hard.\n\n2) What makes the OHKO attacks towards the end even worse, is that the game's art style and particle effects (which cannot be easily adjusted without mods) make reading those attacks and moving away from them extremely hit and miss. Enemies will regularly be completely obscured by flashy effects, to the point that I have died more times than I can count to an enemy that I thought was dead, and which should have been dead if the hit detection next to terrain elements weren't utter garbage, hit me before the particle effect dissipated. It's as if the developers did not know how to handle the game being in 3D, designing effects that should be displayed flat against the ground to avoid clipping into terrain, but displaying them at the level of the characters' heads. For example, say you have an effect that displays a flat circle of electricity on the ground. If even a tiny corner of terrain would clip into that effect, instead of allowing that clipping to happen, the effect is displayed as if the whole thing were on top of the terrain, clipping into or completely obscuring your character and any enemies around him that aren't taller than him. Now multiply that by five, and add in the aforementioned OHKO enemies and maps that increasingly become strewn with more and more rubble in small areas populated by large mobs, and you will understand how crap the whole thing starts to feel.\n\n3) The hit detection and control system is trash, and can't be defended by saying it was a product of its time in a world where games like Diablo and Titan Quest existed first. Left-click moves, but it's also your basic attack. But if an enemy is just out of reach of you as a melee character, and you click to move closer, there are times when the game will just register your click to move as a click to attack, without moving your character within range. This is especially an issue on stairs and around terrain, which become increasingly common as the game proceeds. Once again, it appears to be a product of the developers not knowing how to properly handle developing a game on a 3D plane. This issue is exacerbated greatly by the (uneditable) cursor being extremely small at high resolution, with a design that blends into the levels and characters, and which doesn't always highlight the enemy you're pointing at (again, due to wonkiness with the 3D engine).\n\nIn conclusion, there are so many incredible ARPG dungeon crawling games out there these days, from venerable classics like Diablo and Dungeon Siege, all the way up to modern games like Grim Dawn and Path of Exile. I know the idea of a bright, cartoony Diablo clone sounds like good grindy fun, but there is absolutely zero reason in the modern gaming landscape to go back to a game like Torchlight 1, especially not if you plan to 100% complete it or, heaven forbid, play on Hardcore mode. There are much better, more carefully crafted games out there by more skilled teams of developers that deserve your attention, so take off the nostalgia goggles and go look into one of them. You'll thank me later.\n\ntl;dr: The developers of Torchlight did not playtest their game, and were not prepared to make a game of this type in a 3D engine.

Honestly it's incredibly dull and just generic.

There is some sudden change of pace after floor 30 but it's too little too late.\n- The skill tree while gives some space to try different builds it doesn't give you an official way of respeccing. Which means if you are locked into a \"wrong build\" and your loot RNG is bad you can end up with very weak weapons and generally low DPS for a long time.\n- I finished the game with 3 active spells. One right click spell + one AOE spell + Haste. That's it. I didn't even need more which leads back to the boring aspect of the game.\n\nI could go on but you see I wasn't impressed at all.

Runic deserves your patronage. I wished that Torchlight 1 had more in the way of randomized quests like Diablo 1 did. This has proven to be a solid action RPG experience. I do regret that the RNG aspect has not been favorable. I find that when it comes to enchanting items, the chance of a failure has not been represented accurately. It starts off at 2% and increments by 2 points after each successful enchant. When you get to 10%, the chances of losing all enchantments is high.\n\nTo me, a 10% chance of failure is worth the risk IF INDEED it was a real 10%. That's still up to 90% of a chance disenchanting WON'T happen. I don't know why Runic didn't clarify what they really intended. It's safe to say that you want to stop improving your gear before 6-8 points and use Shrines of Enchantment instead. Thankfully the gambling aspect is much better than it was in the Diablo series, where you can see the prerequisites of an item upfront. That's important for hunting certain items.\n\nPost-Ordrak difficulty can be stupid hard. I can't speak as a true hardcore because I wouldn't have the time and inclination to go for it, but certain enemies will kill you outright especially when they are positioned to your south in the isometric view(a flaw of the camera system). I have a preference for ARPGs to be less strategic, so there's some bias there. \n\nSo in summary, the only two flaws are the RNG and the post-Ordrak difficulty tuning. It's probably not an obstacle for the true Stukovs, but if you're just wanting to enjoy a good ARPG it is a nice short-but-sweet affair.

In every possible version of the multiverse, I would recommend this game for fans of the genre-- if they can read what I have to say next, and come to the conclusion that, despite the flaws, they would still take joy out of this experience.\n\nThis is not going to be the immersive, life-changing experience that Diablo 2 was. And this does not have nearly a fraction of the craft, care, and meticulous planning, balancing, and years of investment and development of Path of Exile.\n\nThis is the funny-looking yet genuinely sweet, light-hearted, and easy-going cousin in the otherwise broodingly dark ARPG genre.\n\nThe thing that might put off otherwise interested players about Torchlight 1 can be summarized in one word: [h1] Jank. [/h1]\n\nGame mechanics, especially class skills, are opaque and under-explained. The pet companion constantly has frustratingly bad pathing around corners and staircases, causing many a back track. Packs of mobs and even bosses can be cheated down from range while you safely stay on the floor beneath (or above) them. Strange bugs exist, like when you use Ember Phase into a teleportation pad it can cause your character to enter a strange endless animation loop (pressing ESC got me out of it). \n\nThe render distance is TERRIBLE  and there is no setting to alter it (I don't know if this is due to some automatic setting, however, considering I am playing the game on a POS laptop). The rendering distance causes you to be unaware of mobs until sometimes it's too late, and overall affects the flow of the game, telegraphing difficulty spikes, and planning out your next moves. \n\nQuest text for the repetitive side-quests consist of a rotating sample of descriptions, with only the name of the quest objective changing each time. A cost-cutting technique that surely reveals the smaller scope and budget of this game compared to other titles in the genre.\n\nAnd whoever edited the quest text for this should have looked at a style guide. Commas, are, definitely, put, in, the, wrong, places, a lot, and used. where there should be. periods.\n\n[h1] The Up-Shot [/h1]\n\nI genuinely like this game. It's simple, addictive, and sticks to the failsafe ARPG formula. I can see myself replaying it for each different class and multiple different builds. \n\nThe main narrative conceit is unintrusively simple. The writing for the main quest line isn't bad, and although some of the voice acting is a little cringey, the actor who voices Alric's journal entries isn't half bad. The necessary storytelling elements don't linger or get in the way-- this is a good thing.

It has a nice soundtrack reminiscent of the original Diablo and having a pet that can sell your items for you in town is neat, but as a game it simply isn't interesting enough to hold my attention.  There's nothing particularly wrong with it, it just feels uninspired and boring.  If you want Diablo-lite with cartoony graphics then you may enjoy it.\n\nFunctionally, it's similar to its inspiration.  You choose one of three classes and enter into a dungeon that goes further and further into the depths below the town.  The problem with Torchlight is that I can't shake the feeling that it's a low-budget kickstarter version of Diablo 1, without any of the charm or personality.  It has a very children's story book art style, which will either be a good or bad thing depending on who you are.  I find the artistic direction inoffensive but I don't particularly care for any of the playable character designs and I find the overall presentation uninspiring. One gripe I have with the gameplay is that ranged weapons seem to have some kind of artificial max range\u2014which isn't particularly far I might add\u2014where your shots just kind of disappear out of existence and don't have any effect on enemies, forcing you to move closer to them even though you can easily see them.  This makes ranged combat in the game feel unsatisfying and annoying.\n\nTorchlight fits the role of a mindless Diablo-style action RPG but there are much better games in this genre to spend your time with.  I'd much rather go and play Diablo 1 or 2 again than play this; I can't help but feel like I'm playing a watered-down, diet version of a franchise that I love with an inferior artistic direction and none of the charm.", "timestamp_created": 1651192784, "timestamp_updated": 1685347698, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114449647": {"recommendationid": "114449647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122605321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 465, "last_played": 1650884241}, "language": "english", "review": "An average ARPG, not bad, not great.

In the world of Torchlight, there is a fine blend of Steampunk and Fantasy universe. We will see robots and magics come together beautifully. This game will deliver everything expected from a typical ARPG and even more in the best way it can.\n\nUnfortunately, character creation is pretty limited. We can choose between three classes of Destroyer, Vanquisher, and Alchemist. Our character's name and choosing the pet's appearance (We can only choose between Dog and Cat in the first game!) are our last options in the character creation stage!\n\nBeautiful cartoonish design of the world with a great soundtrack made by Matt Uelmen will make the Fact-pace, violent, and gore-ish combat humorously good! We have thirty-five floors to explore in the Main Campaign. If you were thirsty for more monster's blood after beating the Last boss there are some ways to calm that thirst! A new area will pop up in the city after slaying the last boss that contains floor after floor of randomly generated dungeons, lots of monsters, and lots of loots just for us! These dungeons aren't enough!? We can open a portal to a random dungeon and clear it out from monsters and loots.\n\nNow will get to the best features of the game. Torchlight's inventory handling system is one of the best you can find on video games. \n\nYou are overburdened with loots!? No problem! Your pet has a separate inventory just like yours. You can store the extra and unwanted items in there. Your pet's Inventory is overburdened too!? No problem! Send your pet to the city from any floor in the dungeon and your pet will come back with an empty Inventory and a pocket full of gold! \n\nYou got overwhelmed in combat and you are on the verge of death!? Fear no more my friend! Set your pet's status to defensive and feed a fish to your pet and your loyal partner will defend you to the last breath with its superpowers! You don't want to cast a spell every time manually!? Just drop a Spell Scroll in your pet's Inventory and, done! Your pet will cast the spell automatically for you.\n\nTorchlight is a fantastic ARPG that lacks Multiplayer but the Single-player experience is more than enough to have fun with this game!

As such, Torchlight contains some differentiating mechanics like a selection of generic spells that any class can learn on top of their class specific skills and the player also has a pet by default that aids them in combat, can travel back to town to sell items and be transformed into more powerful forms by feeding them magical fish.\nI like the Torchlight series because it feels like a classic hack n' slash, but generally more fast paced, and there's a lot more freedom when designing a character than with the usual rigid class system most ARPGs have, barring the lack of a respec system.\nThat being said, it's kind of hard to recommend Torchlight 1 when Torchlight 2 is superior in pretty much every single way. It's not like there's an overarching narrative to follow or something like that, there is a story linking both games, but it doesn't really matter to be honest.

[/h1]\n\nRemember Diablo 1? A game where you're thrown into a barren village and you're given the vital task of descending a cathedral in search for the source of evil that's spawning creatures of all kinds from the demonic realm to torment the poor villagers? Welcome to Torchlight, a village that's quite similar in distress.\n\nThe villagers in Torchlight, however, do not even care about the evil that lurks in the bottom of the mines... They are more concerned with mundane activities, such as the alchemist who literally says \"Nobody cares about whatever's in the mine, all I want is this gem, find it for me and I'll reward you\". Between the funny villagers, the funny interactions with them and a plot that you won't care about, Torchlight offers little variety in questing.\n\nTo emphasize, remember how back in Diablo you've had, fetch quests alongside some creepy, scary \"open this portal at your own risk\" type of quests? Like how you'd read a curse on a book and then a huge scary demon with a horrifying voice spawns out of nowhere, calling you a \"FRESH MEAT\" before you're compelled to run away as fast as you can? Well... in Torchlight, the quests are... quests! Fetch this gem, go into this portal to fetch the flowers... Slay this guy, slay this one, slay that one... At some point, Torchlight will feel very fleshed out and boring. I know it is quintessential for any RPG to have those, but come on... descending four levels for a gem and a small portion of XP isn't even worth it. \n\nAnyways, the game's mechanics are nice; you could also dual-wield as a mage and die in two hits, the game doesn't really care as far as your character's customization goes. There are three classes, a fighter, an archer (of sorts) and a mage. The level design keeps changing the further you descend into the mines, the voice acting is not mediocre, but not good either... The soundtrack is great and then there's... the fishing! Apart from the endless optional dungeon you get after defeating the main game's final boss, the fishing in this game is the most-dragged out, the most-boring activity you could be doing while playing... You've got an average of thirty seconds to a whole minute waiting for a circle to align with the fish mark for you to click it and get the fish... It's just annoying as hell, and for an achievement you have to do it a thousand times! Nope... gotta draw the line somewhere boys...\n\nTorchlight is a 7.2/10 Diablo-clone. It doesn't take its plot seriously (and that's, to me, a good thing) and has a ton of memorable characters as well as a horrid fishing mechanic that, in my opinion, should be deleted from the other entries.", "timestamp_created": 1636100582, "timestamp_updated": 1636409478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58749997615814209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102239794": {"recommendationid": "102239794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159445059", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1700208376}, "language": "english", "review": "i bought the game expecting to receive the full copy..at the end of the demo it informs me it is a demo version. i asked for a refund due to this and steam wont refund me even though i cant download the full version from steam...i have since wrote a compaint to the software publisher as instructed by steam to get steam to fix the issues. will keep people posted...", "timestamp_created": 1636080354, "timestamp_updated": 1636080354, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102210933": {"recommendationid": "102210933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128873294", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1690298806}, "language": "english", "review": "Mod archievmen can`t clear", "timestamp_created": 1636039566, "timestamp_updated": 1640782912, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102141557": {"recommendationid": "102141557", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985468239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3260, "last_played": 1636000647}, "language": "english", "review": "good.", "timestamp_created": 1635933439, "timestamp_updated": 1635933439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102108718": {"recommendationid": "102108718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014014565", "num_games_owned": 599, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 899, "last_played": 1526866880}, "language": "english", "review": " ---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

Easy to pick and play, you can do anything you feel like (Play the campaign, custom maps, grind or farm, look for items). The graphics in-game and artwork look really nice and give Torchlight his own personality and vibe. Easy to apply MODS and enhance the look and gameplay of the game. TorchEd (game editor) is available too if you want to modify the game, or create new maps, by yourself. The OST was composed by Matt Uelmen, and is really fitting for the world of Torchlight. Personally the OST for the Ruins tileset is something else.\nAnd of course, 1000x Better than Torchlight 3!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1634061860, "timestamp_updated": 1656820556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702825248241424561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100909446": {"recommendationid": "100909446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141527623", "num_games_owned": 3476, "num_reviews": 424, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 498, "last_played": 1604455675}, "language": "english", "review": "A lighter-hearted Diablo clone.

And it sucked that I can't get to the higher levels of difficulty to enjoy my game. It sucked ~10 hours on Expert out of me to even [i]get the chance[/i] to increase the difficulty. Also I found out that I love spending time on stats and skills management.\nSo, I remembered about my old Torchlight games. Man, I know this game from 2011 maybe? It's been a long time.  There you have all your pretty balanced difficulties (well, I played on Hard and it [i]was[/i] hard), the stats management and the skills tree. You are free to build your character whichever way you like. Unfortunately, I think, you can mess up your character by maximizing soon-to-be-useless skills. Consider this part of the gameplay experience - you might play a game maximizing the wrong stats and then you'll have to replay it. Some might like it, some might not. I did not have to replay the game, but I [i]was[/i] struggling on the last levels. Glad I had my minions to back me up. Man those little skeletons can put a lot of damage.\n\nI think after ~10 years in the field this game still holds up.\nWell, until you play Torchlight II. Yeah, as some reviewers point it out, I think Torchlight I is obsolete now. It loses on all counts: fewer classes, more boring loot and dungeons, generic enemy design. But only when you compare the two. For me, playing Torchlight I first made playing Torchlight II right after a so great experience I was just blown away by the improvements.\n\nThis game still allows for some mind-numbing clicking and loot grinding, but you may lose interest quickly. Pick a difficulty too easy - you'll breeze through the levels without caring about loot which is almost garbage. Pick too difficult - you'll struggle and since there's no good loot -- you'll find that your time is wasted.\nAnyway, I enjoyed playing this game as Alchemist on Hard. It was pretty fun until the mid-game, then I just started playing in 30-60 min periods so it does not bore me.\nThe plot is pretty bland and boring. It's [i]just there[/i] - if you're into Torchlight universe and want to explore the first part before playing the second - just go to Wiki and read it there. You'll save yourself some time.\n\nBe careful before you decide to play this game. It's pretty good for the time it came out.\nKeep in mind - it's been made on low budget and in short time by very few people. It's like an ARPG-pilot for future greater game. Don't put high expectations on this one and you might enjoy it -- there's a good setting, art and music.", "timestamp_created": 1631298704, "timestamp_updated": 1631298812, "voted_up": true,

In any way. Unless you mean that both are RPGs set in a dungeon. But where the Diablo series was crafted with a lot of heart and planning this one is uninspired to the point that it feels like a mobile game. \n\nFirst - the good aspects. The ancestor gimick is kinda fun although the stat improvements that the \"heirloom\" item gets and the one skill point are absolutely insignificant. The pet traveling to town for sales is good, but given the mountains of trash drops without it I doubt people would 1) be piccking up items or 2) finishing the game altogether. \n\nNow for the bad. The classes are pretty much cookiecutter. You have your mage, your rogue (bow) and your melee basher. The skills don't synergize in any way so \"builds\" aren't a thing in this game. the skills are also quite uninspired as they are mostly just variations of a different damage type (fire, cold, magic, etc.) in a different area of effect (pbaoe, line, aoe, etc.). The items that drop are quite poor - on my lvl 100 char I never changed my weapon from lvl 42 simply because a better one never dropped. And it's not like I had found the motherlode either. The quest is generic and the story is uninspired. The movement is kinda floaty but worse yet the levels are mostly long narrow corridors so that eliminates any kind of skilled play or tactical planning. \n\nSome people say the difficulty \"spikes\" but I wouldn't classify it as such. It's more that you reach a point where normal mobs can't damage you but bosses can 1-shot you, so there's really no balance. and I don't mean 1-shot through some big dodgeable charge-up attack, I mean an insta-cast, insta-hit lighting for example. \n\nThe worst offender by far is that the game just doesn't respect your time and it knows it has no replay value but will do anything to force you to play it longer. This is perfectly demonstrated in the achievements. some require you to finish 50 quests of a type that you get only 8 per full playthrough. Or you have to sell 10 000 junk items (your inventory holds a max of 21 items and some slots are reserved for scrolls, pots and quest items, so imagine how long that takes), or to catch 1000 fish - fishing being quite pointless and slow, with no upgrad eoptions to make it more viable. Or the fact that if you beat the game on the hardest difficulty on hardcore you do not get the achievements for the lower difficulties (as some far better games have done) so you have to replay it 4 full times just for those HC achievements. Let alone the softcore ones. Then there's one achievements that requires you to install 10 mods at the same time. 10! If that doesn't show that the developers knew their product and the experience they provide to be extremely poor I don't know what does. \n\nAnyway, if you are looking to waste some time I guess it's not among the worst games I've played but I certainly wouldn't expect any profound or even well-polished rpg experience.", "timestamp_created": 1629051517, "timestamp_updated": 1629051517, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495179504156112671", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97445093": {"recommendationid": "97445093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122477946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2211, "last_played": 1661664808}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fun and you just it's fun lol", "timestamp_created": 1628804503, "timestamp_updated": 1628804503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97298914": {"recommendationid": "97298914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198445874527", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 10025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1410, "last_played": 1663120698}, "language": "spanish", "review": "If you like Diablo saga then you will love this game!", "timestamp_created": 1628607872, "timestamp_updated": 1628607872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97025846": {"recommendationid": "97025846", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980565944", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 2891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2891, "last_played": 1628223692}, "language": "english", "review": "Greetings as I hope all is well! Below is my Steam Review for Torchlight, thanks for reading as I wish you well in all your gaming adventures...\n\n\nSTORY/LORE - 8/10\n\nThe story and lore to Torchlight is pretty similar to that of the famous Diablo franchise. Evil lurks under the town you\u2019re in, citizens are worried about weird things happening, and you\u2019re here to save the day. There are some decent characters and NPCs here, especially the heroes/classes you can choose from but there isn\u2019t anything memorable like you\u2019d find in Diablo.\n\nTorchlight came out in 2009 and I remember playing it when it first came out and loved it instantly. It\u2019s basically a cartoon version of Diablo, takes the same dungeon-crawling style of things, and puts its thumbprint on it. Best of all, you get to have a pet dog or cat by your side and get to name it as it helps you fight, store inventory, and even cast spells. Bonus points for that!\n\nGAMEPLAY - 10/10\n\nIf you love endless levels in dungeons and enjoy plowing through waves and waves of enemies with bosses sprinkled in, Torchlight is the game for you. It\u2019s a lot of fun as you max out your abilities, get upgraded weapons/armor, and work your way through the various levels and quests. Since there are a lot of different styles of play to use, the replayability is really nice if you want to see what each of the three characters brings to the table. \n\nTorchlight\u2019s gameplay is fluid and doesn\u2019t change the world or anything when it comes to hack and slash games but it\u2019s a fun and immersive experience. This is easily the best feature of the game and again, copies that Diablo formula well as it definitely ranks up there as a beloved franchise that many gamers enjoyed when it first came out.\n\nGRAPHICS - 9/10\n\nTorchlight has cartoony graphics from start to finish and it all looks great. The level design does get a bit repetitive but even those look real nice too, especially the levels with lava. Considering this game came out so long ago, it still holds up to this very day.\n\nSOUNDTRACK - 8/10\n\nAgain, Torchlight is a Diablo-clone, even the music in town sounds eerily similar to what it tries to copy. The levels you\u2019ll go through do have their own unique sound to it which helps to mix things up but it\u2019s pretty linear and nothing that truly stands out or is epic. Even when you encounter bosses, the music doesn\u2019t change or anything. Towards the end of finishing up Torchlight, I muted the music since it does get repetitive and put my own music to chill out as I went through all the different levels.\n\nMULTIPLAYER - N/A\n\nThere is no multiplayer at all in Torchlight, not even co-op. Since this came out in 2009 as a single-player campaign, it has stayed like that. There is a nice modding community for Torchlight and if you Google it, you\u2019ll see that there are a ton of mods to use to add a bunch of new things to the game. \n\nNo multiplayer option mods but at least you can download things like new boss packs, better user interfaces, and I even saw a mod that adds Jedi bosses into the game if you also love Star Wars. Yeah, lots of extra things to go through if mods are your thing to mix things up as you progress.\n\nFINAL SCORE - 8/10\n\nOverall, Torchlight is a very fun game and is one that I hold close to my heart. I remember playing this when it first came out in 2009 and instantly loved it. If you could believe it, my original character was still available to play and it completely shocked me that it was still saved and I was able to pick up and get right back into things. \n\nThe different kinds of monsters, bosses, levels, weapons, and armor are all nice and unique. You can enjoy fishing if that\u2019s your thing as well or play around with a very nice and balanced selection of abilities, spells, and fighting styles. If you want to melee, cast, use minions, dual-wield, etc., it\u2019s all here and will give you a great time once you get to it. I would consider Torchlight one of those classic games many gamers remember fondly of. Especially if you love a good old fashioned hack and slash dungeon-crawling adventure that you can sink many hours into and have a blast in.", "timestamp_created": 1628225435, "timestamp_updated":

If you are a Diablo fan, this game is a more \"cartoonish\" version of the series.  I'll do a small good/bad list of things that really caught my attention.\n\n[h1]Good:[/h1]\n- Tons of customization between class skills/abilities.  So many I would say I spent a good hour overall planning my builds.\n- Endless combinations of stats on gear.  You can really stack unique traits for the build your aiming for.\n- Wide range of different enemy types and zones you adventure through.\n- Game art and music is relaxing and cozy.\n- Very casual gameplay, easy to boot up and grind through dungeons without really needing to give it all your attention.\n\n[h1]Bad:[/h1]\n- Loot.  Any piece of gear that drops has to be \"identified\" with a scroll before you can see the stats.  This is completely pointless and took up a great bit of time.\n- Inventory is very small.  However, you can move items over to your pet and then send it back to town to sell items for gold.  It helped, but I couldn't help but notice how long I spent identifying and moving items back and forth.\n- No in-game re-spec option.  This has to be done via console command. (Does [u]not[/u] flag your character as a cheater, so shared loot-cache between characters is still available)\n- Story was extremely short.  More than half of the game is spent grinding through endless floors of dungeons to lead you to small boss battle.  The final boss seemed to be the only fight in the game that actually felt like your character accomplished something.\n\n[h1]Summary:[/h1]\nI truly did enjoy my experience in the game and recommend any avid dungeon crawler fan to try it out.  This is a classic that has replay value as 3 different classes with a shared-loot cache between them.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1619748810, "timestamp_updated": 1619748860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91099061": {"recommendationid": "91099061", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986638530", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1619781298}, "language": "english", "review": "this game just did not age well\n\nthe gameplay mechanics, inventory, quests, progression and graphics are very outdated.\n\nthere is no reason to play this anymore when torchlight 2, diablo 3 or path of exile exist. even diablo 2 is a better game.", "timestamp_created": 1619692379, "timestamp_updated": 1619692379, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461538463830947876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91080689": {"recommendationid": "91080689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063850423", "num_games_owned": 1133, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 906, "last_played": 1619662401}, "language": "english", "review": "Torchlight 2 supersedes in every way.

Not nearly as much depth as some of today's newer ARPGs, but it suits people who want a laid-back experience, plus it allows you to create some OP group-clearing builds if you put a little effort into understanding the spells and skills. You start the game just walking around, pointing and clicking and watching hp bars go down... but once you put together the right spells/skills/items (it takes a few hours at least to farm items and xp), you can sprint through each level and melt groups of enemies (similar to Diablo 3, I guess, but not as powerful). Or you can keep pointing and clicking if that is your jam.\n\nThe story is meh, and the sidequests aren't really worth doing unless you want achievements (or you have mods that boost the quest rewards -- this game has quite a few great mods out there). Also the endgame content is not super compelling... but for me the most fun part (and the one that rewards the most gold+items+xp) is sprinting through a level and melting groups of enemies and bosses. I have only done a full playthrough of the melee class (Destroyer) so it might be faster or slower on the ranged and mage classes, ymmv.\n\nMore specifically: For the Destroyer class, you want at least Haste+Dervish (spells for WAY faster move speed and attack/skill-casting speed) plus the Devastate skill (AOE melee attack). For items you look for crit chance and damage. So basically you run around at hihg speed, 1- or 2-shotting small groups of enemies and bursting down the tanky bosses. You will see 100k+ damage from crits when you have good equipment, like unique items with good gems and enchantments.

The style is so friendly that even the darkest corner of a deepest dungeon with some vile abomination in it look like they'd been made for your 5 yo little niece.\n*Pet.\nSeems like a nice little additive compared to D1 when you have something to tank some damage before being hurt as some ranged glass cannon. If you don't rely on its tankiness, just use it as a courier to sell each of dozens white items you've looted and after a few minutes it will bring you some 2k gold so you could lose more when you die.\nCons:\n*Pathfinding.\nThere's a single skeleton above you and you want to smash its skull. Well, just go around that corner and climb the staircase, then press on that skeleton with a LMB or a skill of your choice. If you're ranged, you may have some ways to kill it from underneath, but then you still have to find a way up there as the game can't comprehend it if you just command your character to go there or puck up some particular item.\nIt also applies to pets/summons/companions (Brink or what's his face) you may have**.  Meaning that you'll find them staring at walls when they try to get to some mob that is just around the corner awfully often. They also tend to pick the farthest one as a target so in a narrow corridors you may often watch you pet and a group of monsters just hugging in melee when monsters are trying to reach you and pet is trying to reach something on the other some of the corridor, none of them will try to switch and attack what's right near them.\n**Tried a simmoner with imps and golems as skills and 2 different levels of skeletons+archers+sword as spells. Quite a lot of minions if you ask but they all are useless when they don't even try to attack and just line up against the wall. Similar to skeleton-necro in D2 against Duriel.\n*Selling prices.\nI get that they are often way lower than what a player would pay to buy the same item in many games but usually you end up eventually saving a sum up to a point when gold becomes obsolete. Well, maybe I am still to reach this but after 2 final bosses I seldom have more that a few thousands, the rest get flushed down to enchantment NPC just to make my inherited bow obsolete for like 50th time.\n*Skills.\nIf you name a skills differently and make another animation it does not actually make it a different skill. So I've played a Vanquisher until the final campaign boss twice and have relatively low level Destroyer and summoner-alchemist. I read the skills and they don't make much difference. What I'm saying is there's no different mechanics to the skills, they may look a bit different but in a great scheme of things, it's just a melee slash/stomp or a ranged nuke/aoe/charge, all vanquisher traps fell essentially the same, despite dealing different types of damage or decreasing opponents' armor.\n*Mods.\nThey are supposed to be a pro but... well... overall it seems like players can't make the game much less raw that it's been initially made.", "timestamp_created": 1618363051, "timestamp_updated": 1618580544, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90183787": {"recommendationid": "90183787", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000791108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1027, "last_played": 1697373169}, "language": "english", "review": "Similar to Diablo but cartoon style, very fun game to play", "timestamp_created": 1618227027, "timestamp_updated": 1618227027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90044211": {"recommendationid": "90044211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071941550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2713, "last_played": 1620109237}, "language": "english", "review": "it's darn tootin cuutin", "timestamp_created": 1618028916, "timestamp_updated": 1618028916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201315879821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89998931": {"recommendationid": "89998931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078008195", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3661, "last_played": 1622207829}, "language": "english", "review": "fucking shmashing.

A game developed and published by Runic Games.\n\nI am deeply invested in the ARPG genre, and constantly strive for a new game that would satiate my ever growing hunger in this field. Torchlight was one of those games. It had everything i was looking for, from game play style, to the visuals and even the atmospheric level design. Coming from titles such as Grim Dawn and Diablo 3 was definitely a learning curve and we will cover why down below.\n\n[h1]Story 5/10[/h1]\nTorchlight in no aspect reinvents the wheel, it only builds upon an already familiar and well loved mechanic, you run in, you kill things, you loot their gear and use that gear to kill bigger things and rinse and repeat until you are a God. It's story is no different, A relatively cliche story line that very barely covers a reason to delve into these caves and fight hordes of unrelenting horrors, but never the less you do and the story does begin to unfold the further down you go, but never really offers you anything groundbreaking at all. It's well written and the dialogue is entertaining but the depth and intrigue i look for in most RPG's as a whole now is almost completely lacking here.\n\n[h1]Gameplay 5/10[/h1]\n[b]+ Environments:[/b] One thing that has to be said about Torchlight is its development of environments. The world has been painstakingly designed to offer you a certain atmosphere with every step. You'll never feel as though the area is irrelevant or boring because of how unique each map is and can be as a whole.\n[b]+ Characters:[/b] Much akin to the original Diablo there are only 3 classes here, Destroyer, Vanquisher and Alchemist (Essentially Warrior, Archer and Mage, for those of you keeping score). Now i know \"Only 3 classes, that sounds like a negative?!\" And it would be truthfully, but here it works and its works as well as you could hope for. Each of the 3 classes comes with their own set of trees to level up (3 Each) which really helps diversify the characters and gives a \"unique\" element to everyone's individual character.\n[b]+/- Stats/Scaling:[/b] Torchlight neither nails it nor fails it the stat system, Although the levelling system in terms of stats works well from a purely mathematical standpoint, it doesn't really offer much in practice. 50 points into Strength will make you hit a lot harder, but the enemies on each floor are levelling with you, so the change is almost unnoticeable. Which is why i had to give it a mixed rating because although its done and allows you to \"level\" something, its almost completely useless as Armour and Weapons will be what define your damage, not your stats.\n[b]- Movement:[/b] And here is where things get a little messy. The movement in this game despite being almost entirely mouse controlled is extremely clunky and often gets confusing to use. There are very limited amounts of movement skills that allow you traverse the maps easier but they vary vastly in usefulness.\n[b]- Enemy Variations:[/b] In short, there aren't a lot and most just feel like a re-skinned version of the last. Very few enemies offer any sort of interesting ability or random effect that would spark some kind of \"Oh that was different\" remarks. But no, there really isn't a lot here and what is here is rather bland.\n[b]- Loot Drops and Inventory:[/b] I chose to put both loot and inventory into the same negative column because they go hand in hand. The inventory space in this game is a joke, Most of the armour or weapons you find require identify scrolls to even become useful which also take up your already limited inventory, And then on top of that completely useless and under levelled gear will continue to drop for you well into 20 levels lower than you. Couple that with the fact that most of the armour you will find will be for the other 2 classes and not your own. It's definitely a frustrating experience..\n\n[h1]Visuals 7/10[/h1]\nIn spite of its age, Torchlight actually has stayed relatively fresh and visually pleasing, It's far from a graphical phenom by any exaggeration but due to its cartoon style graphical quality and design it has aged extremely well. There was no significant drops in frames in the entire time i played, nor was there any minor or major graphical issues during this time either. The game has been designed extremely well and looks the part.\n\n[h1]Audio 7/10[/h1]\nMuch akin to the visual segment of this review, the Audio has as well aged extremely well, Offering a crisp and delightful soundtrack perfectly scored for the game, and a set of minor although pleasing sound effects that will sound out as you complete your adventure here. Again there were no minor or major audio issues, and it remained crisp and clean the entire playthrough.\n\n[h1]Overall 6/10 \"Imperfect\" [/h1]\nWhilst not groundbreaking in any aspect at all, Torchlight is at its core fundamental, a very decent and well made game. Some of its mechanics are extremely outdated and are reminiscent almost entirely of Diablo 1. The world is interesting but almost devoid of any kind of history and lore, The characters and classes are well thought out and work well in the schematic of the game, but are limited by the clunky style of motion that it provides.

Play it on hard mode to have fun. [/h1]\n\nI\u2019m not the most experienced action RPG player. As far as I know, \u201cExiled Kingdoms\u201d on mobile and, now, on PC is the only ARPG I\u2019ve played, which I thoroughly enjoyed. After playing this, it made me search for more similar games, and Torchlight was one of the titles I\u2019ve stumbled upon lists of ARPG suggestions. \n\nThe gameplay has been often compared to the Diablo series, which I\u2019ve only played once way back in the PS1 days. I barely remember ever descending into the dungeon so I can\u2019t recall the gameplay. So I can\u2019t make the comparison like what many reviewers say.\n\nTorchlight is a straightforward hack-and-slash ARPG. You go into the dungeon, fight your way through a horde of monsters, descend further, and repeat.  \n\nPerhaps I need to try more similar games to have better judgment when it comes to this genre. Because I think Torchlight can easily be repetitive. I\u2019ve spent approximately three to four hours on my first run on normal mode. I reached floor 17, if I remember correctly, without ever dying. Then I got bored. I eventually lost interest and didn\u2019t play it for two or three months.\n\nAround February, I decided to give it another shot. I revisited my first character but I couldn\u2019t remember what the story was anymore (I don\u2019t like checking walkthroughs). So I eventually made a new one. But this time, I figured that I should try it on hard mode \u2014 to be a little more challenging. It was then that I got more invested and started to enjoy.\n\nBut if you want to play it for the story, there\u2019s very little that this can offer. It\u2019s lame and forgettable. So perhaps you can look elsewhere if you\u2019re looking for a narrative-driven title.\n\nTorchlight can be fun and exciting with all the killing of corrupted beasts, ghouls, monsters, and more. So if you\u2019re up for that, then try it out. And if you\u2019ve played other ARPG titles, play it on hard mode. You\u2019ll have more fun. \n\n3/5", "timestamp_created": 1615900567, "timestamp_updated": 1615900913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500118792057037354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88509337": {"recommendationid": "88509337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969433927", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1618783492}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice story telling and fun maps.", "timestamp_created": 1615854450, "timestamp_updated": 1615854450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88505193": {"recommendationid": "88505193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335245469", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1664982538}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just great !", "timestamp_created": 1615847415, "timestamp_updated": 1615847415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88504162": {"recommendationid": "88504162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109918771", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 266, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1671139279}, "language": "english", "review": "I forgot how old torchlight 1 was but it is still pretty nice game.

The voice acting is a little forced, but still enjoyable (Syl has the same voice actress as Ireleth from Skyrim)\n\nBeing a classic style dungeon crawler, the gameplay is \"easy to learn, hard to master\", with considerable build variety despite the limited classes and skill trees. Any class can use any weapon, meaning you can have a tank with an HP steal carbine that fires faster than a crackhead's heartbeat, or a magic man using a greatsword with every non physical damage type in the game, etc. The bottomless dungeon unlocks after completing the story dungeon (it's brutal for a laid-back player).

Some of the achievements are very grindy like fishing 1k fish? Oh and buggy, had completed my Very Hard run and didn't get any difficulty completion achievements.\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n+ Game looks good;\n+ Interface and skill tree is very beginner friendly;\n+ Replayability, there's an endless dungeon where you keep going down floors and fight tougher monsters/getting better loot;\n+ Mod support;\n+ A friendly companion (dog or cat) which can help you on battles and carry loot/go to town to sell stuff while you keep on going;\n+ 3 different classes with various build customizations and each of these can be built differently;\n+ Good optimization/performance;\n+ Hardcore mode.\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n- Story is meh average;\n- Quest rewards are terrible;\n- Getting low level loot when you're higher leveled, sometimes under leveled unique items only good for 2nd characters/runs;\n- On higher difficulties even with a lot of defense there's stuff that might insta kill you, making flat health one of the most important stats in hardcore;\n- When you're enchanting an item there's a chance it might disenchant it completely rendering it useless which isn't fun at all;\n- Some achievements are not fun at all ex: 1k fish;\n- Some achievements don't trigger, such as complete the game on Very Hard didn't grant me the achievement;\n- No skill respecialization;\n- No fullscreen borderless support;\n- No buff/debuf tooltip;\n- Not that much of room to stash items;\n- You can't split a stack of items.\n\n[b]FINAL VERDICT[/b]\n\nDo note that most of these cons can be fixed with mods. Ultimately the game is fun to play and worth completing it, as any other game grab it on a sale.\n\n[b]Mods[/b] that I use:\n\n* Very Healthy Pet;\n* Enchant Never Wipe;\n* Merchant Pack;\n* Smarter Pets & Minions;\n* Spellborder;\n* Torchlight II pets;\n* Shaped Gems Complete;\n* More Stash;\n* Additional Gem Availability;\n* Respect Mod;\n* Stacking Mods;\n* Better Balanced Sale Prices;\n*

On itself, this game is fine, but after checking out Torchlight 2, the flaws in this game become hard to ignore. My goal was to finish this game, so I could hardcore dive into TL2 knowing, that I've tried the previous installment. But by the end of my walkthrough, I was just mellow and waiting for the game to end. And the ending, oh boy...\n\nOK, this sounds like an extremely bitter review, but listen me out. I rate games by the the way I feel after finishing them. If I have more positive memories than negative, I leave a positive review, and vise versa. That being said, you'll love this game if you love Diablo. The gameplay's very similar and even the soundtrack is made by Matt Uelmen, the person behind Diablo II's soundtrack! My main gripe with this whole experience is the lack of consistency throughout the campaign and it's difficulty.\n\nI'm not a person who loves to grind for XP or gold in similar videogames, but I still spend a considerable amount of time exploring bonus dungeons or completing side quests, if they seem to benefit me and look fun. But every single side mission (except one in particular) just follows the same path as your main quest does, so you never even have to go off the beaten track to complete them, which honestly seemed very lazy to me. The exception was the portal side quest, which only teleported you to a random dungeon to acquire some artifact. What's the difference between this one and the other ones? There isn't any. You just appear on a dungeon which has a set amount of floors, so you don't actually progress in the storyline whilst playing it.\n\nAnd what is up with the huge deviation between enemy strength in this game? Every single boss (except Ordrak, but that deserves a seperate segment on its own) was ridiculously easy to beat, whilst the general monsters in the dungeon give you so much more trouble. Not to mention the difficulty gaps on the bonus portal scrolls you can teleport into, which have enemies far higher than your level and supply no worthwhile rewards after beating them. Well, sometimes you find a 'unique' weapon, which, oddly enough, doesn't even feel unique by the end of the game, for all of your current equipment feels so much stronger.\n\n**Noted, I did play this game on hard difficulty. But this final boss is INEXCUSABLE, not even on the difficulty I've been playing at.\n\nSo, you've come this far, you've reached the final floor of the dungeon to find Ordrak - this collosal creature of dark ember energy or... whatever. Keep in mind, this whole game has been leading up to this battle, so you imagine this'll be pretty epic, right? Well, it's not. It's actually... absurdly stupid. As every previous boss was a piece of cake, taking only 3-6 minutes to beat, Ordrak is a BEHEMOTH OF DAMAGE ABSORPTION. I have NO IDEA who's idea was it to make Ordrak so time consuming and such a pain to beat, but dang, they've done their job. Not to mention the array of maybe 3 or 4 moves that he had, which made him so boring to fight and, by the end of it, I harddddcoooore just cheese'd him.

I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to fans of ARPGs, both casual and serious, both new and veterans. This game serves as an excellent starting of point for new fans with how system is very simplified, but also as a good way to scratch any ARPG itches for veterans looking for something post Diablo 3 with how flexible the difficulty system is and the learning curve in it. Though there may not be a workshop, this game does in fact support mods, up to 10 at a time, in fact. And just like Torchlight 2, mods really do breathe a lot of life into this game in areas where it really needed it, such as class expansion and enemy variation. \n\nThe game is far from perfect by any means, however, as the content in game is rather lacking compared to other ARPGs on the market, especially compared to its sequel. You only have three classes, the pet system doesn't really have a lot of depth to it outside of having them sell things in town, the quest and dungeon system is very FATE-esque, meaning you'll really only be going through the same dungeon, but this time, you might have to kill a certain enemy or find something. Even with the Shadow Vault, the endless dungeon unlocked after the main campaign, you're just doing more of the same, this time in an endless dungeon and with the idea of perhaps retiring your hero and doing a New Game with the descendant.\n\nHowever, with all that being said? I still 100% recommend this game, especially since this game, like Torchlight 2, go on killer deals nigh constantly. The game, despite being over a decade old, looks gorgeous in a lot of areas, and plays wonderfully. Scratches the Diablo itch nicely, and it is a very light weight package, and can run on almost any computer. My horrible HP Pavillion All-in-One that I bought off of HSN back in middle school can run this game perfect, which only speaks to its optimization.

You shouldn't really take this game seriously, if you want a worthwhile hard core experience skip this entry and go with its sequel Torchlight 2. The sequel is better in every way. \n\nGame mechanics are a bit wonky thanks to questionable design decisions. Such as a cheap enchanter that allows a high amount of repeated use at the risk of voiding all the stats on the item. Good luck min-maxing that mechanic. The game doesn't have much viable build diversity for higher difficulties. Loot property ranges are so wide that you'll have for example two Uniques of the same name drop with completely different stats and rolls. As a result it feels like there's not much point farming for specific gear. Gear isn't very appealing and that's a shame for a dungeon crawler. The final nail in the coffin is that you can't respec, you can't even undo a misclick so you really should be careful when you're choosing your skills! Luckily it's not all bad, or I wouldn't have recommended this game now would I?\n\nThankfully the community has come in to lift the game out of the hole it had dug for itself. There are tons of mods, from mods that completely change the gear that drops, mods that add new vendors and even those that add completely new features to the game. If you take the time to mix and match you'll be able to craft a version of this game that's most enjoyable to you. This awesome mod support is what makes Torchlight great, despite its shortcomings.", "timestamp_created": 1602540234, "timestamp_updated": 1621598851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60016709566116333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77380582": {"recommendationid": "77380582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184983610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 862, "last_played": 1602319387}, "language": "english", "review": "Diablo 1: Cartoons Edition!\n\nExactly the same game, just reskinned!

Even if you are a Torchlight II fan i recommend looking elsewhere.\n\nI had some fun with this game, no doubt. But if I weren't bored and stuck indoors (and a stubborn completionist) I probably would not have finished it. It's a standard Diablo clone. Made, as I understand, by some of the Diablo 2 dev's, it stands as a sort of \"Diablo 2.5\". Which would be awesome, if it weren't so repetitive. \n\nPros:\nGood art. There are modern AAA games with 10x the pixels and 100x the polys that don't look this good. The tech level of the game is atrocious but the devs had the talent to make it look better than it has any right to.\nTraditional hack'n'slash gameplay is fun for a while. Lots of content.\nTons of spells, huge skill trees, and a massive arsenal of equipment for each of the playable classes offer many options for how you want to play.\nThere is some good level design in places. Puzzles, traps, ambushes. Even some of the optional side dungeons had interesting bits.\nSome upgrades over Diablo 2 like pets, which can either fight or ferry unwanted items to town for you.\n\nCons:\nToo few enemy types, and too many different enemies that do the same thing. This negates the potential offered by the character build variety.\nAwful enemy AI.\nGodawful tech. Engine and graphics fidelity were outdated when it launched in 2009. It looks 8-10 years older. Units and actions actually seem to freeze in time if you move more than a screen or so away.\nBoth the individual areas and the game itself run on too long. Everything is too repetitive. There are some good elements of level design and fun surprises but they are little nuggets in a sea of filler.\nStory is bland, vague, fantasy drivel. But you didn't come here for the story anyway.\nLike the Diablo series, it is very easy to ruin a character by poor skill and stat point allocation. Most of the spells in your skill tree become lackluster after 5 levels, and useless after 10. Only put one skill point per unlock until you know what you are doing. Most should be saved until you understand late game scalings. \nGame is too easy. Play on minimum of Hard or you will be bored.\n\nOverall, Torchlight satisfied my desire for some mindless low-stress grinding and compulsive looting. I have to acknowledge, however, that this game hasn't aged well. I cannot in any good conscience recommend it to anyone knowing that there are much better modern hack'n'slash titles available at a similar price point.", "timestamp_created": 1600841969, "timestamp_updated": 1600841969, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586761653423309326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76396869": {"recommendationid": "76396869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246209868", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1600807105}, "language": "english", "review": "I originally had this game on my XBOX and loved it.

Many various skills, many methods of upgrading weapons and - what I liked the most - pets and summons. In addition to normal experience, the game has system of \"fame\" - it increases each time we beats a huge monster and new fame levels give additional skill points. Fight mechanic wasn't perfect (it's too easy to click near the monster instead of on it, which is a bit annoying), but it wasn't bad either.\n\nThe game was so easy that I quickly switched to hard, because normal difficulty was too simple to beat (it was really like \"I click attack and monsters die\"). I faced the consequences later.\n\nFor long time I was beating one dungeon after another, doing quests. Here is the first problem: each floor was bigger than previous one. So big that after some time it started to take more than half an hour per floor, and usually there are 4 floors per dungeon part. This wouldn't be so bad if fights were interesting, but... well, fights are just one monster swarm after another. There are only few monster kinds per dungeon, so for all four floors I just beat almost identical groups, which becomes boring after some time. But I still played - at least, I wanted to finish the main story (this one isn't great, but not that awful too).\n\nAnd then, around level 30, I faced consequencees of choosing hard. Difficulty suddenly increased from \"not so easy, but fair\" to \"*** monsters that kill me in a blink me before I even see where they are\". There was no tactic other than going very slowly to lure monsters one after another - which made already long levels even longer to play. In addition, to not lose experience, after each death I had to come back to the floor entrance and go through long, long corridors back to the place I previously died. Which is extremly pointless, because monsters don't respawn, so it's just a two-minute walk through empty corridors. Not so funny if you die five times on one floor.\n\nMaybe there are hardcore players that may manage to deal with constant swarms of monsters with ease. Maybe there are better character builds than mine. But at some point, I started to be more annoyed by this game than had fun.\n\nSome people say that Torchlight II is better - maybe, didn't try it. First game, unfortunately, has too many problems with game flow.

If you like Torchlight series in general i'd recommend getting Torchlight 2. It's way better and you won't miss much if you skip this one.\n\n[h1] SUMMARY [/h1]\n\u2605 Good people decided to settle down near a mine that contains a rare and powerful ore and now they are in danger because bad creatures also want that ore. You get to play as a warrior, an archer (can also equip guns) or a mage. The story takes place in a 35 floor dungeon and in the form of voiced text. After completing the story you'll unlock an endless dungeon which is the endgame. Almost all of the gameplay involves clearing dungeons. There's a horse with whom you can engage in philosophical conversations. Your inventory is small,  junk loot is a lot and some enemies have huge damage spikes. You have a pet that's actually useful. You can fish, feed that fish to your pet and watch it transform into a spider. There are fame and character retirement systems. Most difficulty options are easy but there's a hardcore mode which makes death permanent. The environment is randomly generated, interactable but lacks puzzles. Visuals are cartoonish. Soundtracks are few. The game is highly moddable but not multiplayer.\n\u2605 More reviews like this: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/usefulreviews\n\n[h1] STORY (Short) [/h1]\n\u2605 A small enclave was founded near a mine full of veines of a rare and powerful ore and it's in danger because all types of wicked creatures wish to secure this ore for themselves. These creatures come from the levels beneath the town. These levels make up the main dungeon and you need to clear these levels to progress the story.\n\u2666 The story and dialogues take place in the form of voiced text.\n\u2666 There are three characters (warrior, archer and mage) you can choose, each having their own ending.\n\u2605 After finishing the story once (with any character) a new endless dungeon will be opened for you to explore and three NPCs will start giving random quests which require you to progress in this dungeon. You can grind here forever.\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY (Simple and follows common mechanics)[/h1]\n\u2605 Remember that horse i was talking about? [spoiler]Jokes aside, he is actually an important part of the game if you are a completionist.[/spoiler] \n\u2605 Almost all of the gameplay takes place in dungeons. Torchlight isn't open world but it isn't exactly linear either.\n\u2605 There's no multiplayer.\n\u2605 Bosses don't respawn.\n\u2605 Your magic resistances scale poorly. You take way too much elemental damage.\n\u2605 The main dungeon consists of 8 zones split amongst 35 floors.\n\u2605 There is a huge difficulty spike in the final boss battle. This is also true for some other enemies.\n\u2605 You can retire your character when it reaches level 30. A retired character passes down an improved version of an item you own and changes its name so that it includes your character's name. Retired characters become unusable.\n\u2666 Nothing unique about the leveling system and it's capped at 100.\n\u2605 There's a fame system. Completing quests, killing champions (bigger and more difficult monsters with fancy titles and stuff) and bosses gives you fame. Advancing a tier gives a skill point and a fancy title. The fame cap is 55.\n\u2605 Most difficulty options are easier than they should be but there's a hardcore mode which makes death permanent.\n\u2666 You have a pet that can equip spells and items. It flees when its hp depletes and it doesn't have the brightest AI.\n\u2666 Each character has 3 skill trees, each promoting a slightly different playstyle. \n\u2666 You have a stash for your character and a shared stash.\n\u2666 The distance at which enemies are rendered is kind of short.\n\u2666 Hitting enemies isn't always easy. Sometimes you have to be at their level and/or be close to them.\n\u2605 Your inventory isn't really big and you'll come across lots of junk loot.\n\u2666 There are way points at the end of each zone.\n\u2666 You can send your pet to town to sell its inventory contents. This process takes less than a minute.\n\u2666 The town area is where you'll be spending time when you are not in a dungeon. This place hosts a variety of NPCs some of which fulfil different purposes (merchant, quest giver etc.). There's even a shady guy that feeds your gambling habbits by selling you unidentified items for an above average price.\n\u2666 You receive a short piece of story the first time you enter a zone.\n\u2666 There are fishing spots in game. Some fish give your character a bonus, some transform your pet into another animal either temporarily or permanently.\n\u2666 Items aren't restricted to one character but require certain attributes and level to be equipable.\n\u2666 Socket-gem mechanics exist.\n\u2666 There are a good variety of enemies and weapons.\n\n[h1] ENVIRONMENT (Randomly generated, not huge, has a few puzzles and exploration is somewhat rewarded) [/h1]\n\u2605 Each of the 8 zones have a distinct visual style (the 8th zone is only for the final boss battle).\n\u2605 There are many interactable objects scattered across the floors. Some set off traps whereas some give loot.\n\u2666 Although you cycle through the same 7 zones in endgame, them being randomly generated make the map feel less repetitive (but it still feels so).\n\u2666 Most places lack puzzles.\n\u2666 There are hidden areas that contain good loot.\n\n[h1] VISUALS (Cartoonish) [/h1]\n\n[h1] SOUNDTRACK (Not many but good) [/h1]\n\n[h1] ACHIEVEMENTS (Some of them are time consuming)[/h1]\n\n[h1] TECHNICAL (Developer console and save location)[/h1]\n\u2666 There is a developer console which you can use to alter the game (check Torchlight Fandom for more info). There are a variety of commands you can activate \nbut some of them flag your current character as \"cheater\" when activated. That character will loose access to the shared stash.\n\u2605[b] Save files [/b] are located in: [b] %appdata%\\Roaming\\runic games\\torchlight\\save [/b] (I believe it's always a good idea to backup your save files.)\n\u2666 The game doesn't suffer from any form of bad optimization. (At least in my case.)\n\n[h1] MODS AND SUCH (Numerous mods and a game editor)[/h1]\n\u2605 There are numerous mods you can try on [b]Torchlight Fansite[/b].\n\u2666 The game comes with a game editor called [b]TorchEd[/b].

This includes one run on a vanquisher to about level 15 which was somehow deleted by my nephew when he played for a few hours on an alchemist. I then started another vanquisher from scratch and rushed through the story and finished up at lvl 29. For the age of this game(2009), it is solid. I believe Torchlight is classified as an Action RPG Dungeon Crawling Hack and Slash. I'd say this is accurate. If you're craving a story rich dungeon crawl, this isn't the one for you. If you're wanting to hop on a game, jump into a dungeon, and smash random baddies faces in....then this is for you. I Love torchlight because I can hop on and run a few levels and then walk away. As someone who has a ridiculous backlog of games with little time to play them, its nice to have a little dungeon crawling action without committing too much time.  \n\nI burned through the story on normal mode rather quickly and beat the main boss at level 29.  I didn't die once until the last 3 levels and then proceeded to get my face smashed repeatedly by the final boss. I only did the fame quests and skipped all other side quests. The level cap is 100, which may explain the difficulty of the final boss. I did finally best him though.\n\nThere is a lot to like with torchlight. There are three playable classes. Alchemist(mage), Destroyer(warrior), and Vanquisher(ranger). Simple point and click movement with your left mouse button, which is also a basic attack when targeting an enemy. Your right mouse button is an alternate attack(assigned by you). You can assign hot keys to 1-9 for attacks, spells, and potions. Every class gets three different skill trees to assign your points as you level. You get points to put into your base stats as you climb the ranks as well. I didn't play any other classes except the vanquisher, but I thoroughly enjoyed the ranged attacks. You also get a pet(cat or dog) that not only assists you in battles, but also has inventory space. You can load them down with junk gear and stuff you don't want and send them to town to sell while you continue your journey. Each character get a chest of their own in town and one shared chest that can be accessed by any player on your account.

The game was made really quickly by the developers and it can be told. Gameplay is pretty simple, there are three classes and they share a lot of the same passives. The classes are Destroyer (melee), Vanquisher (ranged / trapper) and Alchemist (caster / summoner) There are few abilities for each class, a Vanquisher will likely use either Ricochet or Explosive Shot as they're the only really good abilities. There's a Hardcore mode and several difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard. In practice this is really: Trivial, Easy, Normal, Hard. If you're experienced with Diablo-clones then I'd recommend playing at a min Hard. You'll likely be really bored playing the other difficulties otherwise. There is also a hardcore mode.\n\nA unique element of the game is that you have a pet. This can support you (mostly in lower difficulties) and acts as loot mule. The graphics are a bit cartoony.  Whether this is a plus or negative depends on the individual. A bigger issue is that magic damage against you has really poor scaling. Torchlight's elemental reductions remove only a fraction of the huge damage you take late in the game which is a really annoyance.\n\nThere's the main story dungeon which has 35 floors with one final meat shield boss and The Shadow Vault, a secondary dungeon that is unlocked after you beat the game once (including on fresh characters) It's an endless dungeon that goes for ever. It's full of random enemies and hero monsters. Grindy and a little boring.\n\nBosses don't respawn so boss farming isn't a thing. Primarily you'll farm gold and use that to enchant your gear to potentially broken levels. This is offset by the fact that it can randomly wipe it's stats instead. This was better balanced in the sequel by making it less powerful while not wiping your item. Beating the game lets you retire that character and 'heirloom' an item to give it a big buff for your next character.\n\nI enjoyed playing through the story dungeon with the characters. It doesn't take too long to complete the achievements. It doesn't have much long term draw compared to other games. There is just enough build diversity or interesting content compared to other games in the genre like Titan Quest, Path of Exile, etc. It's still worth playing but I'd suggest waiting for a sale

If you've never played a diablo style game previously, it's a good way to get into these types of games. It's not too difficult, the game is very straightforward, and your pet makes the trip a bit easier on inventory management.\n\nIf I wasn't reviewing this game in 2020, I would 100% recommend it to all. But if you are looking for a great diablo-like game now, try looking elsewhere as there is a lot of them around now, and they're all better than the original torchlight.

If you like going deeper down a dungeon with your brain turned off, this is the game for you.[/i]\n\nI wasn't sure what I expected, but wasn't this. I know the game has been well received for the most part and did well enough to even produce a sequel, but it really didn't work for me. It's been one of the most boring RPGs I've ever had the displeasure of playing. \n\nLet's start with the graphics. They're nothing to write home about. The bodily proportions of all living creatures aren't exactly charming in my opinion and the textures are bland. The visual effects of special attacks and the like aren't anything special either. Visually, the game is mediocre at best. The soundtrack was forgettable as well.\n\nBut let's move on to the game mechanics. The gameplay itself is hindered by the extremely simple combat system. There are three classes, each with three upgrade paths for their skills. That seems promising, right? Well, in the end it doesn't really matter what you choose, at least not on standard difficulty. There are passive upgrades to simply increase your damage in one way or another (boring!) and upgrades that give you new, cool abilities (yes!). Unfortunately, you can only use one active ability at a time. The combat is mostly just left-clicking and right-clicking things with very little tactics involved.\n\nI have to admit, however, that the pets and fishing mini-game are a nice touch.\n\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this game unless you're a really big fan of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1589898988, "timestamp_updated": 1589899206, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69412664": {"recommendationid": "69412664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017168358", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1304, "last_played": 1420055962}, "language": "english", "review": "How did I pick this up: Got it in a sale\n\nPros: Scratches the itch left by Diablo 2 (which Diablo 3 cannot touch).

I can understand it\u2019s a secret portal, but why make it a one way only, I don\u2019t understand the reason behind that. \n-my pet and myself sometimes got stuck, had to exit the game and that did the trick (got stuck behind a lever I had just activated).\n-the teleportation skill of the mage worked much better in Diablo 2. (can only teleport a few meters away). \n-Mobs just suddenly appear when you approach their spawning point i gues (like console games).\n-maps are re-used many times (some levels). \n-my pet sometimes decided it didn\u2019t want to follow me and would go wander off, or just be idle while i got attacked. \n\n\nGame issues bugs/glitches encountered:\n-got stuck a couple of times \n-pet didn't react like it should\n\nTo make it short, I played this game to experience Torchlight, because I\u2019m a big fan of Diablo and Diablo 2, but would rather recommend to just skip this one and directly go play Torchlight 2, which is in many ways much better.\n", "timestamp_created": 1588346920, "timestamp_updated": 1588346920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596625089645385742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68347919": {"recommendationid": "68347919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077439725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 1618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1618, "last_played": 1582457610}, "language": "english", "review": "lacking multiplayer, and quite repetative, but  not bad overall", "timestamp_created": 1588317936, "timestamp_updated": 1588317936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68305683": {"recommendationid": "68305683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105785707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 309, "playtime_forever": 4357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1723, "last_played": 1590038507}, "language": "english", "review": "Completely soulless and devoid of any originality, but will deliver what it promises without any ambiguity and nicely occupy your time.

The world is full of them. But none that make me want to smash their little coconuts in like the bastards in this game. I don't know what it is. They just shit me. Just not enough to quit.\n\nAnd the game seems adept at giving me just enough to keep the smack going as the enemies get progressively harder. Little things. Shiney things. Things that would hurt if you were on the wrong end of them. But they are given to me and not my enemy. So it is by divine right, that I smack the bejeesus out of the wrong doers that live beneath the ground. \n\nBut there is a limit. There is always a limit. A point past which even the most jaded soul must say, \"ENOUGH!\" \nI have seen that place, where you lose the sky and become the thing that you hate. A shadowy thing. I thing that others would pursue into a hole, to slaughter.\n\nI would say \"flee while you can traveller, there is naught here but ruin!\", but you would see it for the ruse that it is. \n\nThere is loot. Great treasure houses full of it, built only to sate the hunger of those who plumb it's depths. To give might to the weakened. Vengance to the wronged. ... and cortisol to the corresponding receptors.\n\nThis is a game to fill your nights and your days.

Lovingly crafted low poly asthetic. The pet system. The fast and fluid action gameplay. Oh, and the pet system, did I mention that?\n\nIt's not without its flaws, of course. The balancing of the base game could be better. It's over-all very easy side, even for non-action-RPG-veterans, but it also has some weirdly powerful enemies who's damage randomly spikes much higher than some bosses' sometimes. And the soundtrack could be better. It's very reminiscent of Diablo 1, but there isn't much of it and it starts repeating quickly.\n\nBut on the other hand, all those flaws are quickly alleviated with mod. Which really has to be shouted out. The game is so well optimized. It runs on pretty much anything, from the most shabby old grandpa laptop, to the most outlandish high-end powerhouse.

But, despite being generically milquetoast at release and a bit dated in 2020, it\u2019s still recommendable for a number of reasons, to both longtime IDC fans and those just looking for a simple introduction to the format.\n\nTorchlight\u2019s own take on the dungeon crawler formula is to avoid the dark and \u201cmature\u201d tone of the cult-classic Diablo and the pseudo-realistic take on mythology \u00e0 la Titan Quest and instead opts for a young adult fantasy novel-esqe aesthetic as if Torchlight is simultaneously trying to be almost edgy yet remain grounded in a distinct cartoony artstyle.  \n\nThe titular Torchlight is a backwater mining town built over the most recently discovered physical source of magic in this world, and uses the mines and natural caverns under the town as the setting the player must explore several dozen pre-determined levels of in order to resolve a really lacklustre plot complication, as clearly written by a programmed-centric development team that knew game mechanics are the thing here that really matters.  \n\nThis aforementioned core focus on gameplay and interestingly diverse levels as you reach further into the deeper levels under the NPC merchant-filled homebase of the town is Torchlight\u2019s strongest point. The game goes so far as to narrow its choice of class and skillset to just three entirely separate classes (ranged/DPS rogue, tanky melee warrior, or mob-summoning wizard), - without appearance customisation options no less, for better or worse. Regardless of whichever class you choose, you\u2019ll be up against the same dungeon design and the same waves on enemies, although the whole thing does seem to fall on the forgiving side of the difficulty curve on even the hardest of the three difficulty options. \n\nEverything mentioned so far is all well and good if you\u2019re just looking for a generic isometric monster clicker, but, I would go as far as stating that the appeal in Torchlight now is the large modding scene it has attracted in the eleven years that have gone by since release. Runic Games has always incentivised modding in their game - going as far as including Steam Achievements for installing them. The simplicity of Torchlight belies a blank canvas for enterprising upstart wannabe-devs to create their own additions to the game (*cough* making excuses *cough*). \n\nThere is a whole world of custom content for this game, and the tools to make your own come part and parcel with the Steam version too! I can\u2019t list any here, because of Valve\u2019s trigger happy health-and-safety-gone-mad approach to removing links, but if only for the potential encompassed in the game\u2019s engine-editing tools, I\u2019d recomended it, especially if you happen to see it on sale.\n\nRecommended.", "timestamp_created": 1583404494, "timestamp_updated": 1583404494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450114935636520386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64506243": {"recommendationid": "64506243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021475120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1583387793}, "language": "english", "review": "Just got back into this game again.

When Diablo 2 came out he gave me his copy of the first one and I was obsessed. It was a transitional period of my life, as I grew from child to teenager, able to play games for adults rather than just Mario and friends for the first time. The difference between the first games simple decent into hell from Tristram and the second\u2019s sprawling world was exactly where my life was at the time.\nJust like Diablo 1 & 2, the Torchlight games have the same path. The first is a simple decent into a dungeon with 3 generic archetypes as classes and the second being the critically acclaimed game that learned from all the hardships of the first. Unlike Diablo though, there are no nostalgia glasses to put on. The difficulty curve, the simple classes, the unexplained magic system all feel like relics from the past. \nOf course, I understand that this is exactly the selling point of Torchlight. Peel back all the streamlining that came with the Diablo games and turn it back to when an ARPG would willingly one shot you. There is a careful balancing act that must happen to make that fun and for every moment it gets the balance correct, it has just as many that fall short and are frustrating. \nThere are times when I am one-shot with no real idea what killed me or how to prevent it next time. There are skills in the skill tree that don\u2019t do anything exciting, adding dmg to your basic attack or lowering requirements for spells. Where the modern games have bound health potion to a specific key, here it is still something that takes the place of a main skill, and you\u2019ll be using it lots. \nThere is a mess of loot, but most of it will be sold. You see the occasional epic or set item and quickly level up past the point that it is useful. In many ways it feels like WoW Classic in that an upgrade can mean going from 3 dex to 4 dex. Even an upgrade doesn\u2019t feel exciting. One new addition to the genre is a pet that will go to town and sell all the loot you don\u2019t need, a small concession that doesn\u2019t really fix the problem of too much useless loot. \nIn some ways it feels clunky. Casting can\u2019t happen while auto-attacking and often I couldn\u2019t get heal spell off in time because of the auto-attack animation. Sometimes clicking on an enemy was hard to do as a ranged class and I would inevitably run right into the mess of battle and die. When summoning minions to help me, often they would spawn on the opposite side of the screen as the enemies, and my help would idle around because they were out of range of the monsters killing me. Its small quality of life things that add up over time and make the game frustrating.\nDespite the outdated and undercooked feel of many of the mechanics, the game has a lot of charm. Some of that comes from the stripped back to Diablo 1 feel of a single descending dungeon to tackle with 3 basic classes. Elsewhere the charm comes from the cartoony style. As much as Diablo looked dark and edgy to me at 10, I prefer the blocky comic style of Torchlight. Here it takes lots of visual cues from WoW again and it is fun. \nOverall the frustrations outweigh the fun in this first installment, and it\u2019s hard to justify playing it over its older brother Torchlight 2. Who gets most of those things right and expands the game to Diablo 2 levels of perfection on the back of this simple first game. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1582842359, "timestamp_updated": 1582842359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532980740070343018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64063811": {"recommendationid": "64063811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025042942", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 5979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 865, "last_played": 1699139174}, "language": "english", "review": "Brink, nooo...!!!", "timestamp_created": 1582574621, "timestamp_updated": 1582574621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64022155": {"recommendationid": "64022155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090671390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1613212302}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and I am maybe 17% through?

Want your character to move somewhere on the screen? Just click on the spot. Want to attack an enemy? Just click on it. As the game progresses there are more gameplay elements added, but by and large it keeps everything rather simple. It should be noted that, like many games in this genre, it is perhaps slightly too easy in terms of difficulty - at least for returning players - and so bumping the difficulty up at the start of the game is advisable to keep it challenging and fun. At the core of Torchlight is running through dungeons, killing monsters and gathering loot. There is a story, but it's one that doesn't take itself too seriously and that (thankfully) never gets in the way of the gameplay. Again, Torchlight is a game that knows that the primary focus here isn't on dialogue, world building, character development or story in general; the main focus is on the gameplay. Add to that the fact that Torchlight is a beautiful game to look at, having a distinct and consistent art style that permeates the entire in-game world is a really rather nice touch that makes the experience of playing it all the more enjoyable. I should note here that the music is also fantastic, changing along with the gameplay and while also being discrete enough to not distract from it. \n\nAre there problems with Torchlight? Well, it should go without saying - but yes, there are issues. Little things like managing your inventory occasionally get needlessly cumbersome, and a few bigger things like enemy texture models popping in and out of existence do undoubtedly detract somewhat from the experience, but far from enough to ruin it. It should also be kept in mind that Torchlight came out in 2009, and since then much has happened within the genre to improve certain game mechanics and whatnot. \n\n[b]All told, Torchlight is well worth picking up and playing in 2020 and beyond.[/b] It's a charming game that allows you to hop in and out as you wish, never demanding too much time from you while also providing you with more than enough content for those days when you just want to keep going. :-)", "timestamp_created": 1582144576, "timestamp_updated": 1582144679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63695629": {"recommendationid": "63695629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027034371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1625, "last_played": 1581988529}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1581984773, "timestamp_updated": 1581984773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63623413": {"recommendationid": "63623413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131366142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1592353206}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like Fate this is a good follow through.", "timestamp_created": 1581872851, "timestamp_updated": 1581872851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63559295": {"recommendationid": "63559295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070860958", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 599, "last_played": 1617415019}, "language": "english", "review": "Great dungeon crawler with plenty of room for mods.", "timestamp_created": 1581787310, "timestamp_updated": 1581787310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63512179": {"recommendationid": "63512179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040973633", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1582663221}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like Diablo 1 & 2?

I'll say, overall, I really like this game and it is fun to play. But, it is also very repetitive, especially if you try to do everything. A big issue is that the maps don't really feel different despite the different skins and the game play is not very deep at all compared to its Diablo counter part. It is good for some mindless fun but it isn't good for a deep dive concentrated binge in my opinion.\n\nI'm going to be honest, this game would only need some minor changes to be so much better. It really comes down to certain things been a let down more than the game being poorly made by any extent. One issue is that the bosses are not really bosses. They are just bigger enemies and they appear constantly, only being marginally harder than a regular enemy. I was hoping that when I came across one, I would feel a tense moment where I would have to take a second and think about how to approach it. But, like most of the time, I went in with guns blazing with very little consequence. This alone makes the game way too easy. On Normal, I hardly felt much difficulty at all. It is fine for the normal enemies to be fodder as long as the bosses had more interesting aspects to them. Like behavioral differences or anything that made that feel more engaging. Everything else wrong would be 100% ignorable if this one simple thing has been dealt with differently. Though, with that said, the last boss is exactly what I wanted. Tough, interesting and different from the rest. Even if it was still kind of basic, it has at least scratched that itch.\n\nAnother issue is something that I have seen in a few different games that I am not a fan of in RPGs and that is the fact that the quests aren't quests. They are milestones. One is just a constant reoccurring quest to kill the bosses you were going to kill anyways with just a little bonus in rewards. The other is collecting different types of unusable embers from certain levels, which I guess is more of a quest than the first but still feels more bare bones than anything. And the third is a guy who opens up a separate portal to ask you to do more or less the same thing as the second guy, which kind of brings me to my next issue...\n\nThere is this aspect in this game that I actually kind of like. Extra dungeons. Including the guy I mentioned before, there are also maps you can buy or gain as rewards for these quests. You active them and they usually bring you to a two level dungeon. I liked this idea and felt it had a lot of potential...But in the end, it sadly made the game seem more repetitive and artificially lengthened. These maps aren't much different than the main dungeon, using the same skins as certain levels. Which, I feel was a real missed opportunity to make something different. Would have been cool to, after running through what is generally a generated dungeon with map chunks, play through something with a more handcrafted feel, even if it ended up being shorted. I think with the Boss aspect I mentioned earlier, this hit really hard. And then there are these portal beasts. You kill them and they leave behind a portal. Which is another idea I really like and granted, was performed slightly better with the portals usually leading to a short level where you get bombarded with powerful enemies. It really gets the blood pumping in comparison.\n\nThe other issue with the extra dungeons though is it is really easy to become over leveled for the main dungeon that was already kind of on the easy side. Though, I think had I not put in time with a handful of the extra dungeons, the game would not have felt so repetitive and I would have found myself enjoying it more and maybe a little less easy. Even if it would still have been both of those things. It is just a shame that something I actually found to be a cool idea actually ends up hurting the game a little.\n\nWith that said, where the game shines, it really shines. Because it was still fun to play. There are mods to fix up some of these issues; expanding possible map chunks to make the map less repetitive, as well as difficulty adjustments and so on. One really cool thing about this game is they are very open to the mod community and there are plenty of mods to look into and I might give this game another run with them and see if they help.\n\nI don't want to give the wrong idea because a review with mostly negative things to mention seems like a negative review but honestly I recommend this game. For the price, it isn't bad at all and on sale it is definitely worth the buy. Just don't expect the difficulty of diablo or anything like that. Overall, I give this game a 7 out of 10.

I was enthralled by the game and fell in love with the world, characters, and gameplay.

So let me tell you when Torchlight first graced my screen I was smitten and bought the game right away after expiring the one hour demo that was available at the time. \n\nAnd now here I am writing a review for a game I've played on and off for the last decade. I can say with for certain this is an amazing game and there is no reason you shouldn't buy and play Torchlight either. The game is compatible with modern systems and it's graphical appeal still stands today with sharp visuals that give the game its own unique look. \n\nLet's not forget the classic dungeon hack n' slash loot-a-thon gameplay we all love as well. Torchlight starts at a little slow but once you have a proper character build going you'll be mowing down hordes of hideous fiends and dastardly foes for all the gleaming gold you can stuff in your insatiable pockets. \n\nThree classes which break down to Melee, Range, or Magic. A variety of NPC's to help the player (Enchanter, Transmuter, Gemmers, Gambler, etc.) and even an infinite random dungeon known as the Shadow Crypt you can explore forever after the game's main quest is complete. \n\nThe game even supports mods and many are still available and working to this day from various fan sites. \n\nTorchlight is a classic. \nTorchlight slaps.\nTorchlight treats everyone with respect.\nTorchlight is that cool person at the party everyone likes.\nFeeling down?

You can choose one of three classes that each also have 3 talent trees. You loot some items, level up, pick a few active and passive skills, kill some bosses and go through a few different areas with a variety of enemies. The story is nothing to write home about but it does not need to be.\n\nThe longer you play the game though the more problems become apparent and especially my playthrough on Very Hard Hardcore made some of these painfully obvious.

Lots of loot and different character build options  for you to experiment with and explore the dungeons on offer.  A fairly short game storywise, a game that doesn't demand too much but can be played on hardcore modes for those that want it extra tough and extremely hard. Its worth mentioning too its a game that you can control via mouse only useful for those of us that may have physical impairments or are creaking at the joints a little bit :-) Once the main story is done there are side quests and many steam achievements to be done (some 66 achieves). Some of the achieves I know I'll never obtain as it requires too much repetition.  This comes around on offer from time to time and is an absolute bargain. Having played Torchlight 2 first (and thoroughly enjoying that) playing the first game didn't really feel like a downgrade or a step too far back as it brought its own charm (no multiplayer option here) all in all to me its a relaxing engaging game good to idle away and enjoy a few hours gameplay at a time.

Ahora si mi opini\u00f3n\n\nUn \"clon Diablo\" (palabra del genero que casi no se usa hoy) cl\u00e1sico que dejara satisfechos a veteranos del genero y nuevos, fue hecho con mucho mimo y talento, con su toque propio, siendo de los creadores originales de Diablo y una peque\u00f1a saga llamada Fate.\n\nRealmente el juego mezcla conceptos de Diablo y Fate pero mejorandolos, por dar un ejemplo tenemos una mascota que cumple funcion de mochila, apoyo y guerrera, esta misma mascota ademas de poder transformarse con peces puede usar conrujos (desde hacer invocaciones hasta lanzar hechizos) y aparte sirve como una mochila extra que puede ir a vender los objetos que entremos sin tener que abrir un portal para ir al pueblo.  Este es un ejemplo por mencionar uno pues tiene varios, pero es mas divertido que los descubran.\n\nEl juego cuenta con 3 clases pero sus skills son todas utiles y ademas tienen skills para poder usar items de las dem\u00e1s clases pudiendo variar mucho las builds, para tener por ejemplo un guerrero-tanque que use arco y flecha o un hechicero que use invocacioens y con hacha en mano pelee junto a ellas, etc. En si mismo a su vez todas las skills son utiles, cosa que en otros juegos del genero generalmente las primeras skills pierden importancia en el progreso de la partida aun si son maxeadas, cosa que aqu\u00ed no pasa.\n\nPor otro lado su dificultad esta bien, para novatos es una buena introduccion, aunque para veteranos ser\u00e1 facil a cierto punto, siendo su dificultad maxima (que se puede elegir desde el inicio) la adecuada, a\u00fan as\u00ed seguira siendo relativamente facil, aunque da un subidon de dificultad en sus niveles finales. (De hecho yo a maxima dificultad iba muriendo 2 veces solamente, llegue a los niveles finales y r\u00e1pidamente llegue a 15 muertes).  Por tanto en dificultad va a ser entretenido para todos los niveles, pero sobre el final puede ser un reto este juego.\n\nHablando de lo \"malo\" es generalmente por la falta de presupuesto imagino por que fue el primer juego de un grupo de desarrolladores con recursos muy limitados, esto llevo a por ejemplo no tener multiplayer (cosa que mods lo solucionaron ) y que rejugabilidad puede ser limitada, ya que al jugarlo 3 veces ya recordaras el mapeado que es bastante limitada la variedad de escenarios que tiene cada nivel de mazmorra. (cosa que para esto tambi\u00e9n salieron mods).\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n es un juego que tiene sus limitaciones por ser el primer juego de Runic Games y ser algo \"peque\u00f1o\", pero sin dudas mantiene una calidad atemporal, yo lo jugue en su d\u00eda y ahora lo volvi a jugar para Steam casi 10 a\u00f1os despues y pueden ver por mis horas de juego que lo sigo disfrutando.", "timestamp_created": 1572685150, "timestamp_updated": 1573030297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56235816": {"recommendationid": "56235816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027784458", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2221, "last_played": 1690167617}, "language": "english", "review": "IDK, no matter how many years go by I keep going back to revisit Torchlight 1.

It is a direct copy of that game after all. It's made by some of the same guys so it's no shock. The gameplay is fairly tight and responsive in its simplicity and the animations are smooth enough. The atmosphere is pretty nice, but only thanks to the fantastic soundtrack (same composer as well).\n\nThe innovation is absolutely nowhere to be seen though. It's almost stupidly basic in its execution. It's too much of a clone, actually, considering Diablo was released in 1996. Pretty much the only new thing added is the pet, which adds nothing to the gameplay - apart from not having to visit town every other minute to sell junk. You can equip the pet with spells and customize them a bit, but it barely makes any difference. Make it a summoner and you have some extra cannon fodder at least.\n\nThere's barely any dialogue and the story is told very sparsely (it all breaks down to; go deeper). This means you get right into the action - no cinematics, no cutscenes, no bla-bla. This is what some people want, so; fair enough. \n\nStats are extremely basic, and so are the skills. This means the game is VERY easy to get into for a newcomer to the genre. And it's very easy to play. Harder difficulties are still hard - but the game itself is easy to play. But.. this is also a problem. The game gets too repetitive too fast. The environments are meh and the skills are not exciting enough to sustain it.\n\nOverall, the game is fairly decent. It does NOTHING new, but nothing outright bad either. It feels like a budget title, as it is, and it should be thought of as such. I swayed between a positive or negative review score while writing this, solely because it's not outright bad and might have an appeal for beginners to the genre. Still, there are better games like this out there. A lot of them.\n\nIt's also completely and utterly overshadowed by Torchlight II, and is made pretty much obsolete because of it.

Unfortunately, it's a straightforward tribute and suffers from exactly the same problems Diablo II did.\n\nThere are three major problems that ruin the game, for me:\n(1) Extremely monotonous, formulaic and uniform structure. The game is purely about clearing dungeons. There is no real story or quests - the three side quests that exist do not change the experience in any way. You go through 4 identical floors of a dungeon. Then you have a boss fight. Then the theme changes, the enemies change, and the cycle repeats. This goes on 7 times (for 35 floors).\n\nYou don't really explore or exploit anything in the dungeons. They also get longer for no reason. In most games, you would call this \"filler\". The combat is fun, but it is also rather compulsive. It's satisfying to crowd control, but there isn't much to it beyond visceral satisfaction.\n\n(2) Game is about PLANNING rather than RESPONDING. You get 2 skill points per level (there are actually two different kinds of XP, each giving you one skill point - but that is largely irrelevant, since they are in synch). Early on, this is fine. Later on, as you need more and more XP, these get very scarce.\nEarly on, the game is easy, and so you play the game for fun. You put points into whatever skills sound fun and work. At this point, the game is good.\nLater on, however, there is a huge difficulty spike. And you can't predict it. The game doesn't slowly change the challenges it throws at you. So you keep building a character that works, until it suddenly doesn't. When it doesn't, you can't really change your build. At least not without grind.\nSince you can't respec your character, you're largely at the mercy of what the game decides to throw at you. The skills also scale terribly, and later skills are almost necessary since they're much better than early skills (regardless of your gear or how many points you put into them).\n\nThe lack of respec is the biggest issue, to me. You can't really experiment with different skills.\nWhich is why you have so many people \"min-maxing\" and going online in search for the \"optimal build\". The game doesn't really give you a chance to respond to a challenge, forcing you to make the correct choice from the start.\n\n(3) Again, the game is pure filler.\nThis has two main aspects. The first is that you have essentially the same dungeon (with minor map variations) 4 times, plus the boss. The second is that the skill tree has 10 points to put into each skill/passive.\nThe result, to me, is a game that is stretched beyond what is interesting. The repeated floors are there to let you earn enough XP to get those 10 points per skill, or vice-versa. \n\nCoupled with the lack of respec, this is a surprising problem. Because each class can be played in different ways. And there are 3 different classes. So why not have a shorter game that encourages experimentation with different specializations or classes? Why stretch a single game for so long, and prevent you from trying different playstyles?\n\n___\n\nAnyway. I honestly find the game very bad. I didn't enjoy Diablo II either, for largely the same reasons (2 and 3, mostly; 1 is also present, but in a less direct way).\nPerhaps the online component and the status of rare items changes the context of the dungeoneering/filler. Even then, however, the game becomes a slot machine, in my opinion.\n\nAlthough this is likely to be an unpopular opinion, I feel like ARPGs (at least traditional ones like Diablo and Torchlight) would benefit immensely from the modern Roguelite structure. It's a lot about making the main dungeoneering loop more interesting by presenting a lot more choices and ways to exploit the random nature of the loot.\nSince you also use a small number of skills, even the combat could be probably changes to a more MOBA-like style, like Battlerite. \nBut maybe this is blasphemy.\n \nAnyway. If you like Diablo, you should like this. It's the same game, minus the incredible atmosphere of the former.\nI guess I don't.", "timestamp_created": 1558808168, "timestamp_updated": 1558878151, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444662153720855713", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50817647": {"recommendationid": "50817647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000256763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 169, "playtime_forever": 941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 938, "last_played": 1558749520}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game very fun well worth your time..", "timestamp_created": 1558749281, "timestamp_updated": 1558749281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50756128": {"recommendationid": "50756128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155418593", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 413, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 617, "last_played": 1556552514}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game that is definitely worth a playthrough if you like Diabloesque games.", "timestamp_created": 1558469506, "timestamp_updated": 1558469506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546632170677185059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50732562": {"recommendationid": "50732562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039692704", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1558333922}, "language": "english", "review": "These games shouldn't be called action-rpgs, they are nothing but advanced clickers.

Unfortunately, I had to manage my word count on the Steam Review and each paragraph may not flow as I originally intended: http://andrewsbase.com/2019/05/03/torchlight-review-a-lethargic-arpg-experience-that-does-not-hold-up-nearly-a-decade-after-launch/\n\norchlight is an Action-RPG in the same vein as all of your genre defining favourites like Diablo, Path of Exile, Titan Quest and Grim Dawn that released a decade ago and was a huge hit on the old Xbox Live Arcade. Runic Games ceased trading in 2017 and have since rebirthed under the Echtra Games label with Diablo and Torchlight co-creator Max Schaefer at the helm and are currently developing Torchlight Frontiers. I thought now would be a good time to venture in to the world of Torchlight.\n\n[h1]Ember.  It lives in us all[/h1]\n\nIf you have ever played a ARPG like Blizzard\u2019s ever-popular Diablo series, you will know exactly what Torchlight is and what it offers. If not, Torchlight is an isometric, mouse-controlled Action-RPG where you must slay every shuffling enemy that presents itself while utilizing a unique set of abilities, weapons and armour while hording every darn piece of loot that emanates from every corpse.\n\nTorchlight offers the choice of three classes which can be boiled down to their basics; a melee focused Destroyer, a magic wielding Alchemist and the range-oriented Vanquisher, with each offering their own unique class abilities and playstyles. For this particular review I was an all-powerful magic casting Alchemist named Azrael who focused on conjuring an array of spells to dispose of the ungodly inhabitants of a mysterious mine.\n\nThe game instantly hit me with an incredibly bland and uninspired story that I had very little interest from the get-go and that interest very quickly waned. Set in the town of Torchlight, the local mine is laden with a all-magical substance named Ember that holds power beyond all imagination and corrupts the very bones of those that dare harvest it. It is this exact substance that is empowering a never-ending spawn of creatures and demons that are serving as protection for their master who is encased at the bottom of the mine. As interesting as this sounds, it all falls completely flat with utterly laughable voice acting and miniscule story bites that are strewn thinly throughout the campaign.\n\nEvery piece of dialogue is served either via a loading screen with one to two paragraphs of text or a small text box during gameplay, this is further confirmed when the story culminated in a singular sentence of a NPC mumbling thank you for your help, before quickly leaving.\n\nSo you\u2019ve picked your class and decided on whether to bring along a dog or a cat as a companion and pack mule that you forcibly stack full of items and send to the games only town to sell and return with your hard-earned cash. This reduces the amount of trips needed to remove junk from your inventory as your fluffy compatriot has the same inventory size as your chosen hero. Not content with being a sentient item wheelbarrow, Mittens or Spot will fight by your side recklessly and constantly flee as their health drains from enemy attacks. However it is possible to buff your furry friend by teaching them spells from spell scrolls or feeding them fish in a bid to transform them in to some gelatinous blob or spider, whatever your preference.\n\nThe town of Torchlight is the only hub in the game and is the only location outside of the mine.  Exciting, I know.  The town is not vast but it had everything I needed to keep my adventure going and is where I picked up all of my very similar quests before delving back in to the depths below. The sub quests are handed out by lifeless Townie\u2019s  and are the exact same every time. I got bored with the robot-bard that asked me to hunt mini-bosses, which were only higher tiered enemies, or the mage tasking me with collecting the corrupting substance Ember \u2013 no thanks, I am attempting to put a halt to the corruption that is spilling out from these glowing rocks, not infect everyone!\n\nSpeaking of NPC\u2019s, the dank, dark and depressing town of Torchlight acts as a hub to sell items, enhance gear, gamble and make use of the shared stash.  I actively avoided leaving the mine unless it was to scoop up side-quests with each tier using the same, tired dialogue or to buy health and mana potions. Like a demanding boss I drove my poor doggo to exhaustion as I made full use of the return to town option, selling all of my junk as I forced myself to go from floor to floor, fighting very comparable foes at every corner.\n\n[h1]Hitting the grind[/h1]\n\nCombat feels incredibly satisfying, something which I regard highly in the ARPG space \u2013 if it feels good to smash through thousands of enemies for a undetermined number of hours, then that is a positive in my book. In Torchlight mulching enemies with a staff, axe or sword feels powerful and weighted while magical spells are entrancing and have nice looking elemental effects, even a decade on.\n\nThis is coupled with one of the best in genre soundtracks as Torchlight is packed to the brim with eery, guitar-strumming goodness. It reminded me of previous Diablo titles and rightly so as it is composed by Matt Uelmen of Diablo fame.\n\nTying combat together is an uninspiring levelling system that leaves a lot to be desired. Each class has three separate skill trees all with their own unlockable physical and passive skills as well as a generic place a point in to strength, dexterity, magic or defense system. Every level up provided me with a skill point while generating fame by fighting mini-bosses let me place a stat point in to one of the three skill trees that each class had access to. For example, on my Alchemist I had the choice to venture down the dark path of necromancy, the strength of a battle wizard or to be more traditional and make use of magical spells. Each skill can be levelled up 10 times increasing its potency, damage and a manner of other relevant stats.\n\nThe actual act of placing points in to each skill was a drag and added to the lethargy I was feeling towards Torchlight.  Something so simple as allowing me to build my character in the way that I want should not be gated off by an arbitrary levelling system. I wanted to max out a skill that boosted my magic stat and I was constantly forced to either not use that skill point and save it for later, until I reached the games desired character level, or place that point in a different skill, where I would be unable to recover it as there is no option to respec. I felt I wasn\u2019t in control of my character build and I was being railroaded down certain tracks that the developer had predetermined.\n\nWhile we are discussing character builds, Torchlight is utterly bereft of any stat screen, to my unmitigated bemusement. A video game which is centred around gathering loot and becoming increasingly more powerful to strike down tougher foes doesn\u2019t give me the tools to truly get down to the nitty-gritty of min-maxing my character or even at times figuring out which weapon is better suited to my build. You will not find health on hit, armour block percentages, damage numbers, minion damage, mana per second, magic find, thorns or anything that you would expect to see.\n\nThere was a surprising upswing in difficulty towards the end, a difficulty that was not present in the previous 95% of the game as I minced my way through hordes of corrupted enemies monotonously.

I want to love Torchlight. If you've never seen a gamesoft like this, Torchlight is an overhead action game that has you exploring a randomly generated dungeon as you dive ever deeper into it's depths to gain experience points, new abilities, and obtain new, hopefully more powerful, randomly generated armor, weapons, and trinkets.\n\nThe aesthetic is wonderful. The art style has personality and the locals differ just enough to keep it's random nature interesting. What I'm not crazy about is the core gameplay. I played through as the \"Destroyer,\" the game's melee brawler. The majority of the game, I breezed through it - enemies crumbled at my feet and spoils were plentiful. But, there was never much strategy to my destruction. Enemies were hard to read and, due to not being in direct control of your character, I didn't see much of a tactic to efficiently avoid danger. It usually boiled down to killing them before they killed you and, by the final boss, making sure I drank a steady supply of potions. My other bane of this game was the before mentioned loot - most of it is garbage. I felt like I spent more time disappointingly poking through my spoils then fighting for it.\n\nMy gut feeling is that these grievances are simply what people expect from a \"Diablo-like\" such as Torchlight. Although I've had an idea what kind of game a \"Diablo-like\" is since Diablo came out, I've never actually gone far into one until now.\nI didn't hate my time in Torchlight, but I am happy to finally leave it.\n\nTL;DR - Combat feel basic, yo.

That is practically where the similarities end, however, as this world is much brighter than the Diablo games, and does not have quite the same level of complexity in terms of builds, etc.\n\nThe story is pretty generic - town is being overrun and you must dive into the caves and save the world, etc. You certainly won't be playing this game for plot. There are three classes available - Destroyer, Vanquisher and Alchemist (again, quite standard for an action RPG). The skill tree and points do allow for a fair amount of variety, and itemisation also plays a big role, with set items being particularly useful.\n\nI also found the endless dungeon system to be particularly engaging, as the floors go on forever and get progressively more difficult the further you go. This is where you will spend your time - the end game - once you have finished the story mode. The heirloom system was also a very nice touch: you can \"retire\" a character, and choose one of their items to pass on to a new character, upgrading it significantly in the process. The ability to mod the game, changing almost every aspect of it, is also a big positive and really adds to the experience - highly recommended to get some mods and try them out.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind before purchasing: there is no multiplayer functionality whatsoever - you will be playing this solo, and it did get a little tedious for me after a while.\n\nRecommended for those looking for something casual, and for those who enjoy their action RPGs.\n\nPlayed on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any issues.", "timestamp_created": 1552123944, "timestamp_updated": 1552124144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669140100479125977", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49420774": {"recommendationid": "49420774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856185353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1590, "last_played": 1677356075}, "language": "english", "review": "Grate game.

Unfortunately, the original leaves quite a bit to be desired and it was ultimately a glitch that lead to me uninstalling the game.\n\nFirst, you cannot manually save and there are no saves for you to go back to. This may not seem like a big deal until you run into the glitch I did. My character was attacked to a tile, unable to move, and with the Town Portal Scroll unable to be activated because reasons. Since I can't load to a prior save, my character is basically stuck and if I want to proceed I need to start over. Granted, I don't mind starting over in games. The gods know I do it enough in titles with heavy survival elements, but a b*tch is not doing that in a game where she's already 9 hours deep into the main campaign. \n\nOn top of this, the dungeons, and environments, are repetitive. Each dungeon has about 3-4 exact levels that are simply duplicates with the same kind of enemies, architecture, and lay out that increase in difficulty the deeper into the dungeon you go. If you're a competent min-maxer who's good with your equipment, you'll find little challenge no matter how deep you go. You can definitely tell where  they made improvements in the sequel with mixing up the scenery, and enemies, so you don't get too bored but In this title, you'll eventually start just blasting through the hordes just so you can get to something that feels new. \n\nThere's no crafting, with the extent of your customization of weapons, armor, and trinkets tied to enchantment wells you find in the wild. This isn't a big deal to me but if you're looking to be able to modify weapons beyond luck/random drops and a couple of gem sockets, this really won't be the game for you. Transmutation of gems seems to be the deepest the game goes into creating effects for your gear.\n\nThere are few classes to choose from and what you can choose offers 3 branches you can sink skill points into for enhancing your character. From what I've seen, the perks seem to be level based so you're not locked into putting points into skills you won't use just to get to something you'll actually deploy. They unlock regardless of where you've put points before which is great when you want a hyper focused build. \n\nSad to say, the game gets boring after about 5 hours. I am one of those people who likes to explore every nook and cranny of a game's world and when the world turns out to be recycled and plain dull, I lose interest pretty quick. All in all,  It was the completionist in me that wanted to finish this game. It wasn't the story line or the game play itself. It was fairly easy for me to shrug and say \"oh well\" when I realized I wouldn't be able to move forward with my latest play through and I have no desire to start over just to get to the end. If you're looking for a good loot heavy ARPG, I would definitely recommend Torchlight 2 but this one might be best left to those coming back for nostalgia.", "timestamp_created": 1551995447, "timestamp_updated": 1551995447, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49365415": {"recommendationid": "49365415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238057946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 11378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2670, "last_played": 1580970268}, "language": "english", "review": "I Loved the game, is you have played diablo 1, in my opinion this game is a lot better.

After the success of the free launch, they've added some new featres (e.g. level editor) and published the comercial version of the game.\n\nNow does the game feel like Diablo 1? Unfortunately, no. It has some throwbacks: The tristram-like town; 3 classes: fighter, caster, rogue; the huge dungeon below the city. But aside from that, mostly it incorporates mainstream overused trends of modern Hack'n'slashes and the final result simply screams \"Generic\". Everything in the game is extremely modular: All the quests are the same, only varying on the dungeon, creature and reward levels; all the dungeon incredibly similar save some very small gimmicks, with only the art changing; all the enemies are very similar also; same for the classes: the fighter and rogue don't feel like fighter and rogue respectively, e.g. fighter uses shockwaves and superpowers that can easily be considered magic and feel little different to the caster gameplay; story is your very generic \"Evil imprisoned below the dungeon\" storyline; etc... Sadly, the result of this is that by 50% of the game you'll be bored and beating the game will feel like a shore.\n\nSo all in all, if you're a hack'n'slash junky that loves the genre, played all the classics and is looking for more, buy this and you'll probably like it.

I recently beat this game and I can say it was an enjoyable experience. I like the versatility of the hero classes in this game. Usually, it\u2019s hard for me to choose between archers or summoners. The vanquisher class permits both so I happily equipped my heroine with guns and skeleton summoning spells.\n\nGameplay consists of exploring caves, slaying monsters, and gathering loot. In return, you earn experience points, money, and fame. I like how the fame meter rewards \u201cfame points\u201d for slaying tough monsters. This meter is separate from your experience meter granting you an alternative method of developing your skill tree. This game\u2019s resemblance to Diablo is uncanny. Like the original Diablo, you start off in one town and travel deeper into the recesses of a mine. There are approximately eight different themes for the 35 levels which tend to drag. Most monsters including the final boss, remind me of the enemies found in Diablo 2 but some look goofy.\n\nI like the soundtrack but I wish the savage beatings and death screams of my pummeled enemies sounded more pronounced. The game assigns you a pet who serves as an ally and fights with you. You can morph your pet into a monster using pet food. The pet morphing concept is interesting except you barely get to use this mechanic during the campaign. The only way to morph your pet is by obtaining food from fish holes which are rare.

I don't give a crap about any of the characters and couldn't even tell you a single one of their names. \n\nThe combat is also boring. I usually like games that involve a lot of grinding, but it feels like its all you do in this game and there is no challenge to it. All you do is enter a dungeon that is made up of recycled rooms from the last dungeon you were in, and room by room, grab a patrol of mobs and wipe them out in 3 secs flat. Grab next group, wipe them in 3 secs. Repeat until dungeon is clear. Repeat in the next dungeon. Then the next. I've done it for 34 floors of the main dungeon hoping for something interesting to happen. Nothing yet though.\n\nAlso pet/friendly minion pathing sucks and they will get stuck on terrain frequently. There also doesn't seem to be a lot of visual feedback when it comes to friendlies getting damaged. You can't see how much health your minions have (other than your pet companion), and due to the large amount of enemies on screen, you will lose your friendlies in the mix. The only way to tell if your minions are dead is when all the enemies stop and come straight after you. Then you know it's time to recast your minions. Another thing is that there is no visual feedback when you are being attacked by enemies. The only thing that happens is that your health lowers. It will only flash red when you are literally a single hit away from dying. I wish it would flash red every time your character is hit.\n\nOn the plus side the game is stable and I've never experienced a crash. The art style is alright too. \n\nOverall, I don't understand the hype this game gets, and there are way better gaming options for the price.", "timestamp_created": 1544337185, "timestamp_updated": 1544376054, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542373716831207275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47285549": {"recommendationid": "47285549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039816589", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1336892400}, "language": "english", "review": "It has been a while since i played it, but as far i remember i liked it very much, especially the pet system!

Sadly, with a little more than a fair share of issues and other unpleasantries.\n\n[b] What's fine about Torchlight: [/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]It's perfect entertainment if watching numbers grow is your thing\n[*]Pushing through with all three classes grants the mild impression of playing three different games\n[*]Quite addictive\n[*]Impressive visuals for an indie release\n[*]It's actually 3D\n[*]The soundtrack. The sound effects. The voiceovers. Audio is easily this game's best quality\n[/list]\n\n[b] What's wrong with Torchlight: [/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]The targeting system is the absolute number one reason for dying in this game. Enemy hitboxes do not correspond to their size, e.g. the bigger the enemy is, the harder it is to target. A deal breaker if you're not a patient person\n[*]After completing the storyline, the only thing to do here is chasing after stuff you don't need\n[*]The storyline is a pale shadow of what's going on in the sequel, Torchlight II\n[*]According to one of the achievements, you're supposed to be able to beat this game in just under 5 hours. Can be a problem if you're expecting immersion\n[*]Socketables are seriously underpowered and don't offer any level of real tinkery\n[*]The game may crash if the player switches dungeon floors and views inventories while the pet is in town\n[*]The Antialiasing toggle in Options makes absolutely no difference in quality, it just cuts performance by half (tested with AMD)\n[*]The idea of having an item disenchanted. I mean, a failed attempt to pay for an enchant and have nothing happen is bad enough\n[*]You won't get much work done without a wagonload of health potions cluttering your inventory. Skills and spells don't make that much of a difference in terms of damage avoidance\n[*]The critters your pet can be shapeshifted into don't feel like they're doing much better in combat as compared to the default dog or cat\n[*]A bestiary would be nice\n[*]The item naming system isn't bulletproof, to say the least\n[*]As is the pause view with the camera rotating around the character (press Enter)\n[*]Enemy factions barely differ from one another in terms of mechanics\n[*]Items lack sell price variance depending on vendor type (e.g. one would expect fetching a better price for weapons from the blacksmith than any other seller, but it's not the case here)\n[*]The Shadow Vault exists only for the reason of being a grindbox. Again, laughable rewards from Valeria and Gar\n[*]Fame doesn't do anything other than double your skill point output. As it increases, it should at least unlock otherwise unavailable content like special quests with unique mechanics\n[*]After hitting level 100 of a character, you stop earning experience and skill points. Renders the most powerful items in the game unusable, unless you pass them down as heirlooms and spend XP accordingly with another character\n[*]And, of course, even if an heirloom is passed down, your succeeding character still needs to meet its requirements. This makes retiring high level characters pointless\n[*]Certain skills and spells, both on player and enemy side, occassionally have no effect on use (e.g. Heal All fails very often)\n[*]Certain skills only work with specific weapon types equipped AND selected, which in the skill's description is stated poorly or not at all\n[*]The pet returning from town notification. It's really unnecessary as a game stopping middle-of-screen popup and disrupts combat badly\n[*]High enough Knockback can push enemies out of bounds, making them invulnerable to ranged damage and not drop loot on death. This may potentially block the player from completing a quest due to lack of the required item\n[*]Achievements don't progress in Offline Mode, e.g. if the player was disconnected from the Internet while fulfilling the requirement. Particularly painful with events such as reaching maximum Fame or taking down bosses, because the achievement is missed and becomes unobtainable with the current character\n[/list]\n\n[b] Why I recommend giving Torchlight a shot nonetheless: [/b]\n\nOther than because it's the prequel to a magnificent sequel, I honestly have no idea. This game is the bastard offspring of good Dev and bad QA.\n\n[b] Rating: [/b]\n\n7/10 Video\n9/10 Audio\n7/10 Storyline\n2/10 Side Content\n8/10 Stability\n4/10 Playability\n\n6/10 Overall", "timestamp_created": 1541652332, "timestamp_updated": 1541652332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540660083293914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45642650": {"recommendationid": "45642650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181872359", "num_games_owned": 584, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 1712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1677279635}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegaso", "timestamp_created": 1541438347, "timestamp_updated": 1541438347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45565500": {"recommendationid": "45565500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025032002", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2065, "last_played": 1330156800}, "language": "english", "review": "Back when I was playing this I remember thinking it's a Diablo rip-off where they forgot to include the atmosphere and missed the ball on lots of cool weapon possibilities.

Ive gone through the whole story this time, but I still stand by my original description. \n\nJust so you know what youre getting yourself into:\n\n1. There are 3 classes total: warrior, mage, archer. About a third of each skill tree is the same between them. For example, all 3 classes have a skill that increases bow/crossbow damage, all 3 classes have a skill that increases experience/gold gain, all 3 classes have a skill that improves armor, etc.\n\n2. You can also buy generic skills like \"fireball,\" \"haste,\" and \"summon skeleton.\" These are categorized as \"offensive skills\" and \"defensive skills,\" and are different than the \"class skills\" in your skill tree.\n\n3. The dungeons are repetitive. Three floors of the same dungeon and a boss at the end, followed by (change scenery) three floors of the same dungeon and a boss at the end. You get a waypoint after the boss.\n\n4. In addition to experience, you get \"Fame\" for completing quests and killing elite mobs. Ive gone through the entire game and I still dont know what Fame does.\n\n5. You have a permanent pet dog or cat. It doesnt help much in combat but it does double your inventory space, and you can send it to town for 2 minutes to sell everything in the pet's inventory. It would be a convenience...if town portal scrolls didnt drop from almost every mob you kill.\n\n6.

Not gonna lie, I actually prefer this over the Blizzard's version of a dungeon crawler. Shifting gears here for a sec; I love the Diablo series, but it gets mundane, especially with the final installment. I just felt it was unnecessary to pay for more content on a dated game that you already paid full price for. Sad that this is what gaming has come down to. Incompletion, micro-transactions, loot crates and pay-to-play/pay-to-win features. I'm a bit guilty of forking cash over to some games, like Neverwinter, but it's not really forced. Whereas with older games, such as Torchlight, you don't feel the need to purchase more content to complete the game. \n\nThe game itself is addicting. The grapics are of course, older, but the story is amazing. The controls are easy and the animations are fluid. I want to say this is like a more childish version of Diablo with its attention-grabbing vibrancy, but it's still violent and a bit gorey. Tons of promising gear and loot to boot as well upon defeating bosses and basically shooting up the environment. There's of course, weapon racks to loot, barrels and vases, etc to attack to reach the sweet treasures inside. Lots of skills to play with as well. Really, there's a lot to compare Torchlight and Diablo with, and I can go on. But you'll just have to see for yourselves!\n\n In conclusion, Torchlight  is a must if you like these types of dungeon crawling games. Plus, you can't really say no to games from Perfect World.

Very enjoyable and repeatable gameplay.  If you've played FATE it's similar in playstyle.  You descend levels, (35 in main quest, limited in a couple others and then there is a never-ending dungeon descent if you're so inclined to never let go of the game).  Once you get past all of the main quests the never-ending dungeon is just an exercise in fetch-this-item or kill-that-guy with a repeat of all the dungeon environments you had encountered during the main quests. A number of them need to be done to complete some of the achievements.  \n\nWhen Torchlight II came out that version consumed most of my time.  More recently, I decided to complete all of that game's achievements.  When finally done, (phew!!!!), I came back to the original Torchlight and noticed I had only about 1/2 of the achievements and decided to work on them.  (Yes...a glutton for punishment am I).\n\nAfter many hours and run-throughs I finally got the achievements down to a final three.  I find these three very odd as I need to add the following: 1 mod, 5 mods, 10 mods and use these total of ten mods on one character at the same time. I do use mods when I find ones I like but I consider them a cheat and to me a cheat is not an achievement...lol \n\nI downloaded and used one, can't even remember what it did and didn't see anything change in the game.  But I now need to add  9 more to complete all the achievements.  I have a copy of the app file I will use later in case there's a conflict among the mods I choose.\n\nTHE REVIEW:\n\nBoth Torchlight games have THE SMOOTHEST GAMEPLAY of any game I've ever played.  The attention to detail is noteworthy.  Some examples that stand out for me:\n  \n~A lamp swinging slowly back and forth up near the fishing hole in town..lots of other items showing motion, as well\n~In Torchlight I the transition between acts is done with a simple visit by one of the main \n  NPCs and a \"note from Alric's diary\" to advance to the next act--both cutscenes are a very \n  quick read and unobstrusive.  (I find long cutscenes irritating, especially if I can't skip them!)\n~Dungeon levels have detailed views of levels below and around\n~Water effects are pretty \n~My characters are very responsive to all commands\n~My pet has three levels of behavior: (1) aggressive, (2) mostly attacks what targets me, (3) passive   (All stances work) \n~Pet can be fed different types of fish that will change it's form for a time or permanently to a melee or magic-casting creature\n~Can send pet to town to sell items and there are add-ons to jewelry, armor and skills to shorten the time the pet is gone\n~The look of clothing changes on character when adding new items\n~The AOEs and melee effects are varied and satisfying when executed--the hitbox is spot on\n~Monsters' effects are the same as above\n~Sound effects are appropriate for locations and actions\n~Monsters are very responsive and even in a mob of them they each act as an individual with a thought for their own safety in mind\n~Obvious to me a lot of thought went into how each type of monster fights...it's not just a mob rushing at you...instead, each monster type in that mob is coming at you in their own way and react to your countermeasures their own way\n~Sooooo many useful armors, weapons, jewelry and socketables to find/choose from!\n~Nice touch to be able to enhance weapons, armor, jewelry from the Enchanter.  Improved in Torchlight II when Enchanter was split into two types, one who can enhance an item, another who only adds sockets to items\n\nI recommend:\n \n~Torchlight I: For a plain o'l hack 'n slash-dungeon crawl game...nicely done!\n~Torchlight II:  Multiply the above with so much more to do, explore and fight...perfection of the genre!\n\nRunic---I miss you!  :(", "timestamp_created": 1528157229, "timestamp_updated": 1528162893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522258400917053223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42418490": {"recommendationid": "42418490", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972063111", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10994, "last_played": 1517439618}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is cumbersome to control and takes ages to build anything.

A classic aRPG, that I feel every gamer who is getting into, or is already into, hack & slash aRPG's should play, at least once. Not just to Ordrak, vut into the Vault. \n\nYes, the game has bugs. Most are minor, just a momentary annoyance. Some are more significant, like not being able to complete side quests due to the quest item always being one quest behind. Yes, I have that in the game... I cannot complete Hatch quests. I'll hope my next playthrough does not pop the same bug. Or I'll break down and install a community Mod to fix it. Even if I have to create the Mod myself.\n\nYeah, I am a fangirl. I'll go to great lengths to continue enjoying this game. \n\nRuns great on a 6 year old medium range toaster gaming rig, custom build. Not the best machine, not the worst. 60 fps all the way, some slight hitching during REALLY busy battles with a sheetload of effects going on. Not often though. Usually when I get slammed by 3-4 champions and their mobs all at once and have to spam spells and spam minions. But, it does happen sometimes. \n\nAgain, be aware the game has some bugs, and always has. Since Runic's publisher shut their studio down, it is unlikely they will ever be completely fixed, unless independent community Modders decide to create new mods to fix them. There are some already out there, you just have to search the old online forums and modding sites to find them.\n\nReplayability? YES. Tons of it.\n\nWorth full price? YES. Absolutely. But always good if you can find it and Torchlight II on sale in a bundle (which happens regularly).\n\nThe game is whimsical and funny, while being gritty and dirty at the same time.

This is the second account I have owned this (and TL II) on. woth hundreds of hours or each game, And hundreds more to come.

That was certainly the case if you look at the field of ARPGs, as a huge number of them rose in the shadow of the original Diablo rather than either of its sequels. Torchlight wasn\u2019t a contemporary of Diablo but even coming a decade later the influence is clear, and unsurprising given the talent behind it at Runic Games. It followed the pattern so faithfully, in fact, that it failed to innovate in ways that have allowed other ARPGs to flourish in the same period. That\u2019s not to say Torchlight is a bad game, but rather one where the gulf between it and better games is evident.\n\nThe town of Torchlight was founded atop an enormous vein of ember, a pretty standard mystical mineral that can enchant or corrupt things depending on what the plot requires. Mining the stuff was going just great before evil monsters began pouring out of the tunnels, and the chaos has claimed your mentor somewhere deep beneath the world. Being a fine, strapping hero you descend into the mines with your trusty (and capable) pet to fight, loot, explore, loot, fish, loot, and maybe get to the bottom of whatever\u2019s going on. And collect some loot while you\u2019re at it.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice the connections to Diablo 1 the moment you load into town, and not just because the BGM there is a send-up of the Tristram theme. The structure of the game is identical, with you descending into a single, expansive, multi-level dungeon beneath the town to score loot and press on to the bosses in your way. Back in town you can sell your junk, buy new junk, mash your old junk into new junk, and give your junk new traits. It\u2019s a familiar cycle, one that\u2019s been expanded upon by virtually every ARPG that came after Diablo 1 (including its sequels), except for those that followed faithfully in its footsteps. I don\u2019t consider this disqualifying, but taken alongside its other shortcomings it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nCombat is where you\u2019ll spend the half of the game where you\u2019re not futzing with loot, and it\u2019s in a rough place between D1 and modern sensibilities. You\u2019re certainly not snapped to a grid in these bright, colorful maps but your skills remain very stiff and not terribly exciting to use. I\u2019ve gotten the farthest with the archer-style character who thankfully gets guns from the steampunk trappings of the setting, but ended up with no skills more interesting than exploding or ricocheting shots. The skill trees borrow from Diablo 2 in fact, expecting you to dump points into a main skill to spam all the time forever and ever. And keep in mind you\u2019re going to be killing lots of very standard goblins and spiders with these skills, albeit very elaborately-designed ones.\n\nWhat Torchlight has going for it, and what can save you from burning out on it after just a few hours, is a load of little side features that still support your ultimate goal of\u2026 well, finding loot, really. Your pet is a pretty big selling point on its own, starting you off with a doggie or kitty that you can eventually transmogrify into all kinds of adorable horrors. They can fight alongside you, get equipped with accessory items, hold extra items for you, and even cart junk back to town to sell while you forge ahead in the depths. There\u2019s also fishing of all things that can turn up special items and buffs, and a portal to randomized challenge maps that can earn you important gear upgrades if you can make it to the end.\n\nNone of these elements are unique to Torchlight, of course, leaving the game feeling like a title cobbled together from the most visible bits of other games. Even the look is heavily cribbed from World of Warcraft, with great big technicolor shapes and over-designed armors and enemies. Time has only made these comparisons less favorable as the genre has moved forward with titles like Path of Exile and Grim Dawn, leaving Torchlight to stand as one of the better imitators of an outmoded game. That\u2019s not the brightest crown to wear but it\u2019s better than nothing, which is really the nicest thing I can say about this game in terms of a recommendation.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

If you do, then Torchlight is for you.\n\nMade from Ex Blizzard staff, torchlight is a hack and slash that has you delve into the dungeons below the town to destroy creatures corrupted by ember and stop an evil force from destroying the world. You can pick from 3 different classes that match what was available in Diablo (a Warrior, Rouge and Magic user, though they are renamed to the Destroyer, Vanquisher and Alchemist).\n\nWhile offering many of the same options as diablo, it does have a few differences that sets it apart. While each dungeon is random (same as Diablo) and the characters skill progressions works much the same as Diablo 2 (some skills feed other skills) you do have a few new options. Your character can have a pet assigned, that helps by sending loot back to down. There is a fishing minigame where the characters can use the fish they capture for different effects, and to transform their pet into something different. You can at any point retire your hero, which grants an heirloom to your new character with some of their skills and stats, which in effect servers as a new game+ mode (which can be accessed at any time as once you pick a difficulty level its locked for that character.\n\nThe difficulty varies wildly, depending on which class and skills you pick up, what loot you find, and the base difficulty. I played the Destroyer and found it quite fun and his skills were quite useful and suited for my play style, however on the hardest difficulty kiting was needed to progress. It got to a point where I was only able to kill a few monsters, retreat/heal before jumping back into the fray, as before my character was wading through an entire level of monsters and rarely using healing items. I\u2019m not sure if I was under leveled for the area or needed better loot, but it got hard fast in a way that diablo never did. Don\u2019t even get me started on the end boss. That was a nightmare.\n\nThe game offers native support for custom mods, which can be accessed at any point from the town map.\n\nGraphically the game looks like a cuter version of Diablo- everything looks cartoony. The game isn\u2019t aiming for a dark and depressing feel so the tone works quite well (even if you are trekking through Ruins, Crypts and other gloomy places). Similarly, the music and sound is the same, instead of screams and roars of creatures you get grunts and the effects of weapons clashing over the top of a relatively mild music score (again think of the Diablo music score with a lot of string instruments). A lot of the enemies are just reskins, with more hit points and extra abilities as you go deeper. I think the total amount of unique enemies (not including the re-skinned variants) sits somewhere between diablo 1 and 2 (but closer to 1).\n\nYou can gamble loot, and enchant items much like the Diablo series, and there are hatch quests to do if you want to take a break from the standard dungeon. If you have an itch to play something Diablo-ish but don\u2019t want to play diablo then this is the game for you\n\nIf you are chasing 100% achievements then expect to become a master of this with multiple runs required, 5 hours speed runs, very hard hardcore mode, a run from each character type, hatch quest plus requiring mods to be installed.", "timestamp_created": 1515476781, "timestamp_updated": 1515477431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6421051025390625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39171032": {"recommendationid": "39171032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067862082", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1289, "last_played": 1535522458}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun game made by the leads of Diablo I and Diablo II.

Outdated now as there are better alternatives in the same genre, but still a good game that you can safely pick up when it's on sale.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nI'm assuming that everybody who reads this at least knows what an action RPG is, so I won't go into the mechanics of the game too deeply, since it doesn't stray far from the general mechanics of games in this genre. Basic attacks, special skills, potions, gems, randomly generated loot, it's all there.\n\nIn the game, you play as either a Destroyer (melee combat warrior), Alchemist (mage-type) or Vanquisher (ranged warrior). You arrive in the town of Torchlight, built on top of a big Ember vein (Ember being a kind of ore with properties to imbue people and items with magical power). The town is in trouble, since monsters start pouring out of the nearby mine, and one of the sages, Master Alric, is missing.\n\nSo down you go into the mines, where you quickly discover that below the mines, there's a huge dungeon that's basically a \"layer cake\" of different civilizations. As you delve deeper into the dungeon, and defeat several sub-bosses, the story progresses until you find the root of all evil at the bottom of the dungeon. This feels very, very much like Diablo 1, and in that way, it was quite outdated already upon release, since games like Diablo 2 and Titan Quest (released before Torchlight 1) already offered a far bigger, vaster world.\n\nRegardless, Torchlight 1 has everything a basic ARPG needs and it does everything quite well. Some things that make (/made) it stand out are the fact that your pet is of actual use instead of it being just a visual addition (you can send it to town to sell loot, so you don't have to go yourself and you can continue going through the dungeon), it has great graphics and music (at least at the time of publishing), there's a great variety in monsters (one thing that I found lacking in Titan Quest), and that it was one of the first ARPGs to have an actual endgame (the endless dungeon) once you finished the main storyline. On the downside, it doesn't have a multiplayer mode, which a lot of players regard as a serious omission.\n\n[h1]Pros and cons[/h1]\n+ fresh visual style and good music & sound effects (by Matt Uelmen, who also did the music for Diablo 1 and 2)\n+ nice mix of fantasy and steampunk\n+ good amount of replayability with different classes, skills, items, difficulty settings and the \"endless dungeon\"\n+ a lot of variety in items and monsters\n+ big, unique boss monsters\n+ a pet with multiple uses (attack / defend / sell goods at town)\n+ moddable game with quite a lot of good mods available\n+ fishing (which doesn't do much for me, but I guess it's a \"thing\" for some people :) )\n\n- not much of a storyline\n- small inventory size\n- the worlds are a bit too big, so gameplay gets a bit repetitive before you reach the final boss\n- no multiplayer mode\n- trillbot :)\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nIt's a good game with quite a lot of replay value and definitely worth the price, although I'd advise to pick it up on sale. You can still get enough fun and gamplay out of it, even if you do only one playthrough. It can't really compete with more recent games in the same genre, though. If given the choice, go for Torchlight 2 or Grim Dawn instead, which are more developed in pretty much every single way. Or, if you like complex ARPGs with huge skill trees and even more game mechanics, go for Path of Exile.", "timestamp_created": 1514733026, "timestamp_updated": 1514733026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38884784": {"recommendationid": "38884784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118845778", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1461995747}, "language": "english", "review": "stop reading this matthew", "timestamp_created": 1514686110, "timestamp_updated": 1514686110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38858193": {"recommendationid": "38858193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063081334", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1814, "last_played": 1514820136}, "language": "english", "review": "Started being fun and interesting, ended with being boring, repetitive and overly time consuming.\n\nAt the end, there's a minion that kills in 1 or 2 hits and its a directed laser so its not possible to dodge or out skill it.

Only perhaps for die-hard ARPG fans and even then for free or on a 3$ sale like I did. \nDo not be fooled by the \"Very Positive\" reviews this game has on Steam. This is mostly because Torchlight 2 is such a big hit, it affected its predecessor aswell.\nSpeaking of which, the second installment in the series, Torchlight 2, is a really great game which solves almost all of the problems mentioned above, along with adding unique and immersive maps and epic boss fights.

Each class has 3 destinctive talent trees.\nI only played the mage Class. Every talent tree felt very unique and well balanced on it's own and followed a specific theme (Caster tree with insane mana regeneration and a lot of more damaging spells and CC spells; a Summoner tree with lots of minios and talents to enhance them and a Melee tree, with armor enhancing, a magic shield and close-up abilities).\n\nThe base game does not support resetting of spent talent points, but there is a mod for that.\n\nIf the loot lord is not with you, then you can buy stuff at the \"gambler\". Basically you can pick an unidentified item for a reasonable price. The item will have a certain quality, although the rolls on it are random. \nWould only suggest that for weapons, because you get a good dps on it and thats kinda the most important thing on weapons.

Or what if I go into a shop and instead of paying for a \"general-you-never-know-what-will-happen\" upgrade or a completely different weapon or armor, I could ask for something specific to be done to my stuff?

Engrossing, not challenging. Because Torchlight is not an action game (if defined as a high-stakes button-masher requiring wicked reflexes and spatial awareness). Half the time, I'm not even watching the screen during battles. I'm spamming magic bouncy arrows and monitoring my twin health and mana gauges.\n\nTorchlight is a resource management simulation of a dungeon crawler. You spend most of your time comparing armor and weapon stats, shifting gear from place to place and optimizing loadouts. The dungeon crawling and fighting parts of the game are merely resource harvesting for the ecosystem of destruction that surrounds my Amazon warrior (aka a \"Vanquisher\").\n\nAnd perhaps your experience playing the wildly randomized world of Torchlight will be different. As for me, I selected my Vanquisher - a chick who shoots guns, crossbows and bows - on normal difficulty and just started augmenting her native stats and abilities without branching much. A quarter through the game, she was noticeably overpowered. Halfway through the game, and she was a force of nature. My gun one-shot all but the largest monsters, and my pet cat endlessly spawned a hoard of zombies to handle crowd control, aggro and dirty fightin'.\n\nOne or two times during a single dungeon level, I paused to load my cat up with gear and send it back to town to sell it at the market. While it's gone, I endured what I jokingly call \"hard mode,\" actually having to carefully draw enemy aggro, aim my weapon at specific targets and flank my foes. I could not WAIT until that damn cat gets back.\n\nYou really want to play Torchlight as an action game (otherwise, I would have selected the fighter ... er ... \"Destroyer\"). The enemies are all pallet-swapped idiots. The dungeons are repetitive. And the bosses are a joke. But the loot, oh my GAWD, the loot. Torchlight strokes that same mental tick as bottom-feeding browser games like Farmville. Just one more shiny thing.

It has a much more simplistic approach than something like Path of Exile (another arpg I would recommend), so it's a lot easier to hit the ground running in this game and just enjoy it. You have 3 classes to choose from when naming your character, depending on what sort of playstyle you prefer. There are stat points that you gain as you level up (generally these should go towards your main damage stat and/or whatever requirements you need to wear your upgrades). You also get skill points, which are fewer in number, to level up different attacks, spells, and passive abilities on your passive tree. Once you figure out what you want your character to do, it's a simple thing to allocate points. \n\nThe artstyle is very much cartoonish; however it does not detract from the gameplay (unless you're the sort of person who gets hung up on that sort of thing). There are four difficulties to match your level of experience with arpg type games, so feel free to pick this up even if you're an inexperienced player. There is also plenty to do after you've beaten the final boss: like completing achievements, crafting endgame gear, and grinding higher level monsters.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun, single-player arpg experience, give this game a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1506760684, "timestamp_updated": 1506760684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572636187076568604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35317190": {"recommendationid": "35317190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075022752", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 902, "last_played": 1506807886}, "language": "english", "review": "honestly, the game just kinda feels like a \"waste your time\" simulator but not in a bad way, more like \"i have somewhere to be in an hour and i don't know what to do\" kind of way. 10/10 would spend 12 hrs doing nothing again.", "timestamp_created": 1506731500, "timestamp_updated": 1506731500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540660858154296875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35232931": {"recommendationid": "35232931", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994574201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3646, "last_played": 1539834167}, "language": "english", "review": "Brought to you by most of the team largely responsible for the granddaddies of them all: Diablo and Diablo II, including the fellow who did the music for the games.\n\nIf you liked D & D2, then you'll very probably like this.", "timestamp_created": 1506473401, "timestamp_updated": 1506473401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35212994": {"recommendationid": "35212994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048545336", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1004, "last_played": 1506981299}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good for a couple hours of entertainment. But nothing more.\nGonna stay on the positive side and rate 6/10 because I did enjoy it for some bits.\n\nWhat you got here is a pretty looking game. Seems you can play three different characters with different styles.\nI played only one. Do not get the feeling I would have a different experience/story playing the other two.\n\nI did very much enjoy the first couple of hours. You level up, get new spells and abilities. You are able to customize your dude a bit so you can play different styles every few floors. But in the end you get pretty strong and you can just rightclick through anything that comes at you without having to be arsed about anything else except mana.\nExpect to click those mousebuttons like a maniac.\n\nUnfortunately... there's hardly any story to the game. The most an NPC will talk to you is 7 lines or so. You get 0 connection with your character as he's annoying as fuck. All he ever says is 'My pack is full'. Because your inventory space is nonexistant. After a couple hours that really becomes irksome the repetitive message of how your inventory is always full. \n\nSo.... your inventory is always full. You have a pet, and the pet has a backpack. Yes. You can toss all the crud you don't use onto your pet and make him run to town and sell it. That's a relieve atleast. The pet does help a little in battle, but you don't miss him much when he's off to town. You can customize your pet as well, he can wear a necklace, a pair of rings and learn two magic spells. I felt that was a nice touch, but it's not really that game making or breaking with how it been executed.\n\nSame as the way you can enchant weapons, gem them or upgrade items. The options are there.. but did I feel the need to use them? not really. At some point the game is just done, and you can continue.. but I did not get a feeling of reward. It just became dull playing with an enchanted weapon.\n\nI did like the fact you get to discover what the game has to offer on your own. Didn't really notice anything of a tutorial. It does have mouseover tips, but no popups that'll tell you what to do (not that I remember). So it's fun to discover what is possible and not. Found out about the pet's backpack a bit later on, was happy to find that, and then later the option to make the mutt run to town and pawn the clutter.\n\nAt some point the story just seemed to be over. There's more quests you can do. But at this point you kinda miss the guidance. There's no indication of where you need to be. For example you need to find an 'Ember' of some sorts in the Necropolis. There's no place named Necropolis. You can go into a mine, or some tomb or whatever it's named. And it won't name a floor number or indication on minimap, you can't quest track. And at this point the quests do not add anything anymore, not for me anyways. There's no way to find out in the game where this fucking Necropolis is. Unless you use google and youtube.\n\nAt some point I did not get the feeling I was making any more progress in the game. It was just more and more of the same. Holding right mouse button and move towards the end of a floor. \n\nSaw an option to retire my character, as to make him unplayable and leave an item with high value for a next character I would be able to play. But there was no indication that a story would continue. So just gonna asume that it would be more of the same, on a character that looks a tad different and has different attack while you hold your right mousebutton.\n\nI got this game in a pack, torchlight, torchlight II and Hob. \n\nTruly, the game is beautiful, and I did enjoy several hours of playing. But I cannot stand by recommending this game for full price. if at sometime you can score it in a sale I would tell you: go for it.\nBut don't expect 100+ hours on it. I was done in about 8 and then felt disapointment grow in the 8 following.\n\nEncountered only 1 bug. One where I got stuck. And no way to restart the level or use teleport. All the support was based on windows XP.

I remember playing the demo on the console forever ago and somewhat enjoying it, so I thought I'd try it out while it was on sale. The gameplay is exactly what it looks like in the thumbnails. You spend most of the game beating up enemies with a large array of weapons and magical attacks with different properties.\n\nHowever, this game is very dumbed down and shallow. The lore and quests are not very deep, and the voice acting is over-done and a bit comical in its style\u2014which can be enjoyable, but is not for everyone. The focus of the game is to beat up monsters inside of ruins, which can be pretty fun if you have the patience to get through the game.\n\nAs an RPG, this game lacks many customization options. You have a choice of three types of characters\u2014one of which, the meelee character, is basically obsolete\u2014and an option to have either a pet cat or a pet dog. Other than that, even though there are many items in the game, their properties are ultimately meaningless. The only real stragegy to play the game is to sell old items and buy the most powerful new items. The result is that, even if you spend a lot of time considering how you want to approach the game and saving up money to design specialized weapons to fit your play style, you'll end up cycling through weapons as you progress and your old weapons quickly become obselete. If you play this game, it's best not to put too much thought into your weapons and armor, since they will be replaced by better weapons by the time you make it back to the shop.\n\nThe game is not very challenging on any difficulties other than the hardest difficulty, and it doesn't allow you to change your difficulty in a save. However, in this game, difficulty is not exactly something that you want, since this game spawns in the same enemies every time you re-enter a dungeon. Not only this, but the levels are very repetitive and not very meaningful. Each level and boss looks very similar to the last, and you'll end up wishing you could get through the repetitive level design a lot sooner.\n\nIf you give the game a little patience and little thought about the meta-game, and can bear the quirky art style, you might enjoy this game, but it can get repetitive and annoying as you go along.

Originally I had hoped to find a similar game to Titan Quest which I used to play for a long time. So having some experience in this genre I started playing hard mode as a melee fighter. Though I wasn't maxing out my stats but testing a lot of skills for their effectiveness, fights (even boss fights) became pretty simple after I had found out that the only necessary skill was the AoE attack spell you get on the first level. Using two additional defensiv buffs and group healing spells for my pet enabled me to kill most creeps with one blow which I didn't even had to aim due to the AoE attack. So most fight were right clicking somewhere one the screen and taking a mana potion when necessary -> pretty boring.\n\nFurther cons:\n\n- Your pet cannot die, so you don't have to take any care but can rather use it as a free additional HP buffer. By using its own healing spell it almost imidiately reengaged after fleeing.\n\n- It is quite common to pass a map several time when descending further downstairs. Reusing a map isn't very oringinally.\n\n- There isn't any interesting story or dialog which I wanted to listen to. \n\n- It doesn't make any sense at all that the player has to fight through the whole dungeon, while after every boss monster this woman is coming through the portal und talking to you.\n\n- There are only 4 completely identical quests - kill the boss monster, klil an arbitrary hero monster, find an ember and raiding an additional dungeon. After finishing one quest you'll get the same one again.\n\n- Costumization of your gear is very limited by just adding up to two embers which don't have a great variability in their effects. \n\nPros:\n\n-  I don't have any good pro argument for this game. At least gold isn't completely worthless like it is in Titan Quest because you can enchant your weapons.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499292545, "timestamp_updated": 1499292545, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.40599822998046875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33120735": {"recommendationid": "33120735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019112527", "num_games_owned": 1390, "num_reviews": 161, "playtime_forever": 2861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2861, "last_played": 1386190607}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Diablo but with good graphics.

My next stop was back to Torchlight a dungeon crawler that I feel tries to bring back that classic feeling of the original Diablo.  Overall it succeeds, for its time this was a great dungeon crawler for those wanting a classic feel with some cleaned up mechanics.  I still enjoyed my play through and is a great stepping stone towards Torchlight 2 (another game I highly recommend).\n\nStay awhile and Listen:  From the town to the indentify scrolls this game feels like the spiritual successor of Diablo and it is an enjoyable experience.  The story isn\u2019t bad either albeit a bit bland (again not necessarily a bad thing for the game\u2019s intent) and although I would have liked to see a bit more to do in the end I can\u2019t complain as the core gameplay is so well done.  If you are trying to show someone classic dungeon crawl this is a better game to start with than some of the originals this game takes from.\n\nSupersize me:  It cannot be understated how involved the mod community is for this game and how much it influences this game.  There is even an achievement for installing a mod and I find myself installing a mod almost immediately.  I know many of you won\u2019t like this but I installed the respec potion mod.  I have never really understood the need for some to insist that choices like this have to be permanent.  Depending on the game it should be as easy as going to a town or as difficult as a month long process.  I just never feel a character (especially when the end game is good) should be permanently punished for a bad decision a new player made 5 minutes into playing.  I digress, give the mods out there a look; an argument could be made that you should probably play the game to completion before installing any to get the vanilla product down but it is your choice.\n\nYe Olde Classic:  Everything about this game screams classic dungeon crawl, even the difficulty if you decide to crank it up.  This is both to its credit and detriment as there are some issues that are caused by this design philosophy.  Some quality of life features are missing such as minion information:  I enjoy playing minion master type classes and it was hard for me to determine when I needed to respawn minions in the middle of massive battles.  The mini map could use a bit of work as it seems to take inspiration from older dungeon crawlers in this area too (TL2 massively improves upon this) and blends into the scenery.  Draw distance for enemies and even odd instances where enemies would phase in an out for odd reasons (no they weren\u2019t teleporting).  Finally, some players may feel the game was too simple, with very basic leveling system and little to do other than the next level.  I can understand but do not agree with this.\n\nSo much of this game takes inspiration from Diablo and I love it, it was a great trek down memory lane.  But, is it worth buying now?  Simply put, yes.  There are some issues that much is obvious but the little issues are well worth the game itself.  If you are dungeon crawler who doesn\u2019t have this game; get it.  It would also be a great buy to get someone into this genre.", "timestamp_created": 1496878402, "timestamp_updated": 1496878402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693172991275787354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32185459": {"recommendationid": "32185459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053280666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1926, "last_played": 1427600980}, "language": "english", "review": "Does not support Xbox 360 controller so you can't easily play it on a TV.", "timestamp_created": 1496611534, "timestamp_updated": 1496611534, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.256975680589675903", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32113756": {"recommendationid": "32113756", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993618849", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1344, "last_played": 1312614000}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than Diablo.

The Alchemist is pretty much the mage class, and great for summoning minions. The Destroyer is a figher, and the Vanquisher is more or less the rogue/ranger class. \nHowever, in the game, any class can use any weapon, provided they meet the minimum criteria. So this game allows any player to play how they want to, wanna use firearms? pick up a pair and start blasting. Swords? Shields? Dual wield? Go for it. LIke them mad DPS? like the big numbers? They got weapons for that too!\nPersonally, I found The Alchemist to be the most useful, because he has a lot of spells that are great crowd control. Trust me, crowd control is a MUST in this game, as you will often start hacking and slashing away at many enemies at once on screen, so its possible to get lost in the chaos. The Alchemist also has Minion spells, which come in handy, as your pet can only handle so many enemies at once. I believe he can summon up to six Nether imps(on a maxed out skill) a steam golem, a beam golem, and possibly one other construct of some sort, all at the same time, so you have eight minions, your pet and yourself, to tackle an end game dungeon, which WILL come in handy as the Dragon dungeon will be INCREADIBLY HARD!\nThe story is You coming to Torchlight for...(insert character's reason's here) only to find out that there is this rogue master, or something along that lines, and you end up getting corrupted by the same thing he is, and you have to set out to cure it. From there its a bit fuzzy as I can remember only so much, but this game overall, is worth it.\nThe voice acting isn't bad either, granted most of the voice acting is narration, but it still doesn't ruin the immersion.\nOverall I would give this game a 7/10 as there are a couple things they need to improve on such as a little lesh restrictive character choice, more pets, and enemies.\nI would still recommend you buy it, and play it for yourself, because this game can easily steal 30 hours of your life away.", "timestamp_created": 1493211255, "timestamp_updated": 1493211255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549892306327819824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31332071": {"recommendationid": "31332071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006077632", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 7610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7610, "last_played": 1492929399}, "language": "english", "review": "After 125 hours, far more than anyone can say is reasonable for a game you're not enjoying, I can safely say that Torchlight is not for me and I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nIt'd be tempting to nitpick, to try to justify my stance to be some semblance of reasonable, to browbeat others, but that's not what we're here to do.\n\nI can't recommend Torchlight because I don't like the core mechanic of pointing and clicking to direct and attack with a character in realtime combat. That's just a core disconnect that Torchlight is never going to bridge. I didn't realise it going into it, but after 125 hours of unenjoyment I had plenty of time to go over where I went wrong in life.\n\n[h1]\"It's not a scam!\"[/h1]\n[i]- Shopkeeper you're risking your life to protect.[/i]\n\nWith that clear, subjective, inescapable bias out of the way:\n\nTorchlight is about descending below the titular Torchlight, through 35 floors with 6 themes to them, various bosses popping up along the way to say hi. It's Diablo but more colourful. \n\nThe death-filled dungeon's environments are fairly nice, and provide an appreciable backdrop to endless slaughtering.\n\nArt design has some nice visual density without being cluttered or too generic. The ground being a canvas, combined with enemies not immediately despawning, leaves you knee deep in the dead after every encounter, which always a good look to end on.\n\nEnvironmental design covers levels that I couldn't tell you are procgen or not. Either they're tilesets or they're copied and pasted to death, but either way it's linear and boring. Your massive levels shouldn't leave me wondering why I even have a map.\n\n[h1]\"Go on, get out of here!\"[/h1]\n[i]- Shopkeeper you're putting your life on the line to keep alive.[/i]\n\nCharacter design fairs less brilliantly. Tends to stray into gaudy Blizzard territory, goofy - sometimes plain ugly - designs combined with giant pauldrons. The works. You've seen it all before, and it's never looked good. Not sure why character only have three fingers, either.\n\nPlaying as these ugly characters, weird difficulty spikes abound; even on Very Hard, most of the time you're invincible. Nothing can touch you, doesn't matter what class you play as. Then boom, hitscan beam or elemental attack waterfall of pain that destroys you in a second. Pumping elemental resistance by spamming gems that, even when maxed to Perfect/Flawless, add pitiful bonuses that just encourages the pain. \n\nThe Dark Zealot is infamous for a reason. It was less frustrating than just baffling, that things would be balanced like this.\n\n[h1]\"I've got things to do.\"[/h1]\n[i]- Shopkeeper you're fighting and dying to keep his way of life viable.[/i]\n\nLuckily it's mod-friendly. Extremely, extremely mod-friendly. I'm certain it wants you to mod it.\n[list]\n[*]Tired of potions refusing to stack after 20? Done.\n[*]Tired of the default slow running speed? Fixed.\n[*]Not quite sure that completing the game on Very Hard permadeath, with multiple Dark Zealots destroybeams hitting criticals, is even possible without continually running through the game to spam retirement upgrades? Nerfed.\n[/list]\n\nMods could probably change how unbalanced the classes are, but in the vanilla state you really want to use Vanquisher. Every class can use every weapon and a good half of the skill tree (side note: every time a game with a skill tree is released without a respec, I commit crimes.) is universal, but it's simple logic:\n\nRanged weapons have the same DPS as melee. DPS-based skills deal far more damage than flat-damage upgrades and summons are worthless. Your biggest dangers in this game is closing distance to kill high-value targets before they immediately kill you. So the Vanquisher creams where the Destroyer and Alchemist scream. Compared to her, they're almost painful to play.\n\n[h1]\"DON'T. WASTE. MY. TIME.\"[/h1]\n[i]- Shopkeeper angry that you spent 10 seconds of his time after hours of running through lethal gauntlets filled with killer goons.[/i]\n\nPostgame activities are in here, you've got the Shadow Vault, which is just running the same tilesets/levels with different enemies in them until you get bored, nary a boss or postgame questline in sight, and you've got fishing, which is worthless. \n\nAfter 1000 fish I got two permanent fish, so there's your payoff for that. You can probably mod it.\n\nYou could make a case for there being a story, but I'm not sure I'd buy it. NPC shows up every now and again, and there's exposition between tilesets, that's about all there is.\n\nSo I didn't have fun with, at all, so I couldn't recommend it. \n\nBut as for saying whether or not it's good, frankly I don't think I'm qualified.

I've enjoyed this game since 2013, and although I haven't played it in a while, it, along with Torchlight II, are probably my favorite ARPG games!\n\nThe game is set in the small mining town of Torchlight, and the town needs help, as its mine is being attacked by monsters. As you continue further and further down the mine, you'll see a vast array of different enemies and environments, and quite a bit of loot to be had! \n\nThere are three classes in Torchlight, and each one has different spells and weapon specializations. \n\nThe Alchemist is a mage, specializing in staffs and wands, and has elemental spells and attacks. He has the highest MP of the classes.\n\nThe Destroyer is a melee-oriented class that is best at using swords, axes, maces, and polearms. He has the largest health pool of the classes.\n\nThe Vanquisher is a range-oriented class which has abilities that strengthen her ranged combat. She is best suited for long-range combat.\n\nTorchlight is an enjoyable game to play, and and its visuals nice. Its soundtrack is excellent, as well, and compliments the game quite nicely, giving it its cool style, just like the sequel has a nice style. The environments in the game are pretty fascinating as well, and sometimes quite varied, and there's many places to explore, and some side quests to do too.\n\nI also appreciate how lightweight it is, graphically. I think it still looks pretty good, while at the same time, being able to run even on old machines in my home, including old laptops!\n\nThroughout the game, just like with its sequel, there is a huge variation of armor, weapons, and enchantments that you will find, and you can also transmute items and enchant things at an enchanter. You can also find \"ember\" to socket items, which gives you various bonuses.\n\nOverall, I have no complaints about Torchlight. Its gameplay is very satisfying and quite fun, and I would certainly recommend this game, as well as its sequel, which introduces multiplayer co-op! Definitely pick both of them up, if you are someone who enjoys ARPGS, Co-op games, and loot games. ^.^", "timestamp_created": 1486972254, "timestamp_updated": 1486972254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592088997364044189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29707566": {"recommendationid": "29707566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042375641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1348124400}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Diablo style dungeon crawler", "timestamp_created": 1486258876, "timestamp_updated": 1486258876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29677458": {"recommendationid": "29677458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097209819", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 1232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1232, "last_played": 1521833175}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun enough Diablo-like ARPG.\n\n\nThe graphics are fairly lo-fi (even for the time) but the art direction is nice so it works.\n\nAudio design is fine and the soundtrack is pretty amazing in places, but god I can't stand the old man voice telling me when I've finished a quest, levelled up etc, his pretentious fake british accent makes my flesh scream.\n\nThe story is as basic as they make them (\"something evil is threatening our village, work your way through the dungeon and kill it\"), but honestly what would you expect from a hack'n'slash?\n\nAs for the most important part, that is, the gameplay:\n- The industry standard three classes: tanky melee guy, archer woman and mage. I went with the archer because that's what I always do in this sort of game.\n- The four character stats (strength, dexterity, mana and defence) are really straightforward - strength buffs melee, dexterity buffs ranged weapons, mana buffs elemental damage and defence makes you tankier. Items have stat requirements that (unlike in Torchlight II) you HAVE to meet in order to use them.\n- Passive and active skills are simply locked by level as opposed to being arranged in a tree you progressively unlock. Active skills usually depend on weapon DPS and they're going to be your primary means of dealing substantial damage. Passives buff your combat abilities, pet, buy/sell prices, money drop rate and various other things.\n- The loot system is a little weird, for example I kept using a bow 20 levels lower than my character simply because I hadn't found a better one since. Sockets and enchantments allow you to improve gear but there's the annoying chance of an enchantment attempt disenchanting the item.\n- You have a pet who helps in combat (but its role mostly just boils down to aggro tanking) and can run back to town to sell items so you don't have to warp back as often.\n- Once you finish the main storyline you unlock a randomly generated dungeon with randomly generated kill/fetch quests, much like the entirety of Fate (the sort-of prequel to Torchlight). It gets repetitive after a while.\n\n\nSo yeah, this is a good ARPG that you should definitely play if you're into the genre at least a little bit. It's not as good as its sequel though, imho.\n\n\nEDIT:\nUpon trying to replay the game months later I must say it does get old pretty fast in comparison with its sequel. The skills (and, as a consequence, the combat mechanics) feel less rewarding, and most of all it's a dungeon crawler from start to finish. I prefer the format where dungeons alternate with less maze-like open areas to give me a break, and the quests in TL1 mostly being just the \"go to level 21 and kill [randomly generated miniboss] to get some extra XP\" type of thing really doesn't make me eager to keep playing. It's really just a grind centred around an underwhelming central storyline.", "timestamp_created": 1486155280, "timestamp_updated": 1521848292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552238821983337402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29564202": {"recommendationid": "29564202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023044912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1556, "last_played": 1369119600}, "language": "english", "review": "Diablo clone.

It's not even the first in the genre but I always remember it as one I never got bored with. I played floors the way I take my medicine, one a day. It's interface, challenge and loot always keep me coming back. Even after I finished the main story I still delved deeper into the extra dungeon that opened up if only to test my mettle.\n\nLet's take a look at the story though since I brought it up. You're helping this mild mannered swamp town inhabitants by venturing into a bottomless cave in hopes of uncovering the cause of the blight that has cursed this small mining community. More focused you're helping another adventurer find out what's happened to her friends. While you journey down the mines you read journal entries on what happened to the alchemist you're chasing. It all leads to an epic battle in which you see who's got the bigger magic stick. \n\nReally though, this is one of those games where the journey matters more than the destination.  I like the idea of the three classes as there's lots of ways to take down enemy hoards. You can even take your trusty pet with you. I prefer playing with the alchemist. I find that the best approach to taking on large groups of evil spawn is to summon my own to fight with me. The game is probably easiest with this class and I generally really liked the versatility with weapons and skills to choose from. The vanquisher and destroyer classes both have their strengths and weaknesses but I think the alchemist is more middle ground with the best of both worlds. \n\nThere is loot a plenty. Weapons of all shapes and sizes. Many different things you can use to kill. There's also no shortage of quests. The one thing I think I would have liked was to have more towns or diverse number of people you could interact with.

It can be addictive building up your character, and the game provides a decent amount of ways to power up outside of simply gaining levels.  You can attach gems to equipment, try to have equipment enchanted (and risk having all enchantments removed), and buy random equipment that could turn out to be enchanted.\n[hr][/hr]\nUnfortunately, there are way too many things holding this game back.\n\nFirst, the graphics and atmosphere.  It was designed to run on netbooks so the graphics are very simple.  That doesn't bother me so much... but the cartoony exaggerated look that couldn't be more generic means you'll be playing this for the mechanics only (more on that later).  The music, composed by the guy who did the music for Diablo 1 & 2, is just alright.  It sounds a lot like Diablo, but not nearly as good as Diablo.\n\nSecond, the itemization is poor.  I found my best equipment not even halfway through the game on Hard.  Outside of finding rings that would give me +8 Dex vs +6 Dex, I had basically the same equipment loadout for the last 6 hours or so.  Nothing that dropped even came close to what I already had.\n\nThird, the dungeons are dull and feel way too long.  You have a mine, spooky castle, lava place, spookier castle.  That's about it.  The layouts are randomly assembled from larger pieces, but there is nothing whatsoever interesting.  Other than randomly coming upon merchants and bosses, there is nothing to look forward to or be surprised by as you explore.  Some unique hand-crafted rooms or levels or something would have gone a long way.  You have to go through 35 of these to beat the last boss, and once the item drops got boring so did the rest of the game.\n\nFourth, the enemy variety is awful.  You typically have 2-3 enemy types per level.  Usually a small fast monster that just charges at you, an archer or wizard hanging back shooting spells, and a big tough monster that slowly comes after you.  That is basically it.  Each type of enemy will have some unique abilities (such as \"shoots fire\" or \"stun resistant\") but most of it is window dressing.  The bosses are just HP-inflated monsters that summon minions over and over.\n\nFifth, the game is way too easy.  Diablo clones need to strike a good balance between being difficult and unfair, and need to give you access to skills and tactics that let you push the odds in your favor.

And that's perfectly okay. Namely because that's me.\n\nTorchlight is an isometric action RPG where you bind active skills to the mouse and number keys and make your way down 30 floors to kill the big bad, only for you to turn into the big bad yourself in the sequel ([url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)]Sound familiar?[/url]). Along the way you will level up and find incrimental upgrades in the form of magically enchanted gear to buff a list of stats and attributes to make your time much easier. \n\nAfter that, you're pretty much done, you can then enter an endless dungeon full of ever-increasing baddies onwards to level your character to level 100 and then retire, but you will usually be absolutely done into your early 60s and will want to move on.\n\nIf none of that sounds fun, Hack N' Slash games are not your thing. Sorry.\nIf it does sound fun, congrats; buy this game and get started immediately so you can catch up on all the Hack N' Slashes you missed over the years.\n________________________\nWhile many might think that the level to 60 and quit is a dumb thing. I honestly think that might be the entire point. At least for me, this is a game you blaze through during a nostalgia trip and then move on. Your accumulated knowledge from various other loot fests will be put to use here to absolutely destroy the balancing in the game compared to your downward trudge the first time because you thought you could handle Hard (More on that later). I very much look forward to my next playthrough in 2-3 years.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean the game is without a large share of flaws due to its age. I will go over the Pros and Cons\n________________________\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]This game was $20[/b] during its release back in 2009. It has since been given out in bundles, as well as a free gift to people at one point. It's currently $15 as of this review and usually gets 75% off during sale times.\n[*]The art style used here is timeless. Even after 7 years, it looks as good as it did day 1\n[*]VERY easy to run on a modern-day windows system (At least compared to Diablo 1/2)\n[*]It is an excelent gateway to other Lootfests\n[*]4 basic character atrributes are simple to understand. Life, Melee damage, Ranged Damage, and Elemental Damage.\n[*]You have access to a pet that can sell your garbage for extra coin without you needing to leave\n[*]A lot of numbers do not have a soft cap to them. So if you exploit the start of the game, you can get enough gems to get something dumb like 16 +4% crit chance gems which totals to roughly an 80% crit chance after maxing the skill on the tree\n[*]Simple and robust modding system, drag mod files into mod directory and you're set.\n[*]You can somehow remember every single line in the game despite only playing it about 5 times through total\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The Pet is 95% useless in any combat situation, the best thing they can do is maybe draw some mobs away from you before he dies again..\n[*]And again....\n[*]And again......\n[*]As this game is over 7 years old, you can believe you can have a difficult time trying to find mods, let alone developers who still support them.\n[*]Movement speed is one of the worst things. If you pick the melee or mage, you move like a snail. Picking the ranger will have you move like a turtle. Get movement speed enchants and Haste ASAP\n[*]Difficulty scaling is by far one of the worst I have ever seen in a game. More on that later\n[*]This game was released during an awkward point where you combined basic attacks as well as active skills; meaning you run out of mana constantly\n[*]Store weapons and armor are at least twice as good as loot you find in the dungeon; so you will be mostly buying new gear instead of finding a really nice equip.\n[*]No easy way to identify multiple items at once without binding the scrolls to a hotkey\n[*]An overwhealming majority of your early-game skills are outclassed by the ones around level 25. Resulting in quit a handful of wasted skill points.\n[*]No non-cheat/mod way to respec your character. Once you pick a skill and confirm, it's there forever.\n[*]Unique/legendary gear is largly just a rare item with a unique model, hardly an guarenteed stat rolls, and the ones that are guarenteed are largly useless in my experiance.\n[*]As with all Diablo-typed ARPGs, it is almost impossible to list a name for this genre.\n[/list]\n________________________\nNow then, on to my biggest complaint throught the review; the higher difficulties are 100% trash. Do not even bother picking them unless you want to hate yourself. I have did a little research on Floor 1 and concluded that the HP and damage scaling is like this: Easy = 50%. Normal = 100%. Hard is 200% and Very Hard is about 300%. Besides that, nothing else changes; no extra loot drops, no mob changes, just extremely high numbers for your level. As such, the only way you can get through most of the floors is to overlevel like crap before then, which is just padding to make the game longer.\nTacked onto this, the final boss is one of the worst designed bosses in history, in my opinion. At level 28, [i]with a 79% crit chance after 15 +4% crit chance gems[/i] it took me 25 minutes of nonstop running and potion chugging to defeat him on Hard, [url=https://youtu.be/FIcnOQsJIP0]As Seen Here.[/url] (Sorry about the waternark, issues with shadowplay) I will admit, I was 2 levels behind him, but this is with 0 going back to grind in a 5 hour speedrun.\n________________________\nHOWEVER. Despite all my gripes with my most recent playthrough, I will still wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone on the fence about playing a Hack N Slash Loot Fest ARPG Diablo Clones, and a fun little romp for veteran players to break the game the way they want it to, especially for only $15.\nJust, you know, not on Hard or Very Hard", "timestamp_created": 1469066098, "timestamp_updated": 1469261306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24424762": {"recommendationid": "24424762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063066377", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 507, "last_played": 1471781983}, "language": "english", "review": "SO DAMN GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1469019812, "timestamp_updated": 1469019812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494623631238937378", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24321467": {"recommendationid": "24321467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001485804", "num_games_owned": 4155, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 2867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2865, "last_played": 1648166436}, "language": "english", "review": "The steampunk-esque theme looks great, the game plays well, and having a pet means less returning to the surface.

Tambi\u00e9n incluye let's play: http://www.agustinfest.com/2016/07/torchlight-diablo-estuvo-aqui/\n\n* Jugu\u00e9 Torchlight en el 2009. En ese entonces, mi tiempo de videojuegos y ocio estaba completamente atrapado por el leviat\u00e1n de Blizzard: World of Warcraft. Despu\u00e9s de un rato, World of Warcraft me colm\u00f3 y necesitaba, desesperadamente, alejarme de los MMORPG. Pero tampoco quer\u00eda dejar el g\u00e9nero ni cortar de ra\u00edz. Me enter\u00e9 de una peque\u00f1a gema llamada Torchlight. Result\u00f3 que era justo lo que necesitaba.\n\n* Torchlight es un dungeon crawler muy al estilo de Diablo. Es la historia de tres personajes y cada uno de ellos se divide en tres clases, lo cual resulta en nueve combinaciones b\u00e1sicas. \u00c9nfasis en el bot\u00edn aleatorio que da combinaciones infinitas de armas. Adem\u00e1s de los monstruos, tambi\u00e9n hay jefes medios que siguen un algoritmo de azar medio interesante.\n\n* El juego tiene una historia b\u00e1sica de fantas\u00eda. Unos cristales poderosos est\u00e1n corrompiendo las cosas con su magia. Tu enfermas por esta corrupci\u00f3n pero tambi\u00e9n te vuelves m\u00e1s poderoso. Tiene uno que otro giro interesante pero nada espectacular. En este juego es mejor consumir las horas explorando los calabozos y consiguiendo mejores armas.\n\n* El juego tiene mods y aunque la mayor\u00eda sirve para ajustar la dificultad del juego en extremos, hay algunos interesantes que agregan clases, las armas y los enemigos, algunos extienden el papel de la mascota que te acompa\u00f1a en tus viajes. Estos mods pueden descargarse en la p\u00e1gina oficial de Torchlight.\n\n* Recuerdo que pas\u00e9 algunas madrugadas explorando los calabozos de Torchlight. Fue una experiencia muy agradable. Encontrar mejores armas y armaduras, y hacer combinaciones infinitas de personajes para limpiar mejor a una horda de enemigos puede ser hipn\u00f3tico, las horas de van, y al final, es una manera muy agradable de pasar el ocio. Claro, no se compara a Diablo, el original, pero se acerca mucho.\n\n* El juego tiene una dificultad muy balanceada. La ambientaci\u00f3n es excelente. Los sonidos y los gr\u00e1ficos, ya pasaron un poquito de moda, pero todav\u00eda se defienden bastante bien. Es posible encontrar este juego en oferta, a veces hasta regalado. Y es una excelente experiencia de un s\u00f3lo jugador (ojo, no tiene multijugador). 40+ horas de ocio lo avalan.\n\n* \u00bfLo recomiendo? S\u00ed. Para quienes gusten de los calabozos, las experiencias de un solo jugador, matar hordas de monstruos, el azar, la fantas\u00eda y los clones de Blizzard, este juego es una excelente opci\u00f3n. \n\nLet's Play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbvE-K29K_w&list=PLf3hSHJ6VZaPvcnZ6PBIdcaRQeN5Xp4V4", "timestamp_created": 1468095372, "timestamp_updated": 1468095372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24191305": {"recommendationid": "24191305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119669110", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1638241218}, "language": "spanish", "review": "terrible juego lo reocmiendo 10 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1468011252, "timestamp_updated": 1468011252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509505689144134521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24184979": {"recommendationid": "24184979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049823783", "num_games_owned": 1714, "num_reviews": 1150, "playtime_forever": 3073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3073, "last_played": 1383446381}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Toda persona que haya jugado juegos estilo Diablo, seguramente no se va a sentir decepcionada por este titulo.\nYo la primera ves que lo jugu\u00e9, estuve literalmente desde la tarde de ese d\u00eda, hasta la madrugada del d\u00eda siguiente sin levantarme nisiquiera para comer.\n\nEs muy adictivo, al ganar el juego con los 3 personajes, se puede pasar un \u00edtem para rejugar el personaje denuevo pero dicho item vendr\u00eda mejorado, Sino se puede ir a calabozos infinitos de mayor y mayor dificultad (como los de diablo).\n\nEl juego si bien no tiene multiplayer a diferencia del torchlight 2, es Muy rejugable y les va a dar cientos de horas de diversi\u00f3n, es una de las mejores compras que pueden hacer.", "timestamp_created": 1467993730, "timestamp_updated": 1467993730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24173170": {"recommendationid": "24173170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174771873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 10344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8259, "last_played": 1596220074}, "language": "english", "review": "Dark Zealots.

(long range, uses bows, pistols and 'traps', very low def, high att at long range) and the alchemist, (low def high att with neat effects and elemental abilities). They got their bases covered and therefore everyone can find someone to enjoy.\n\nOh and you get a pet too. Dog or Cat. Husky/German Shepard (Its hard to tell) Or, a Lynx. They can sell stuff for you in the dungons.\n\n\nSo, I never feel unsafe within the mines of Torchlight. I handle everything with the cocky swagger of an alchemist that totally doesn't have a cloud of imps with him at all times. Might be a problem who knows.\n\nAI pathing is quite good to my suprise, you run into packs of foes and they all fall to the ground as fire or electric bolts pulse through them.\n\"....and you know what I did it for? An identify scoll! And did you know the pistol I discovered was absolute trash? It was! Harharharhar and then I killed a pack of bats or something in about three clicks...\"\n\nI love this game, Easily my favorite dungon crawler to date. 10/10\nThere were times where I had to stop playing because my finger could not click anymore. That should speak for itself, quite frankly.\n\nDon't bother trying to face the final boss. He'll keep summoning dragons and eventually they'll mob you and you'll be set in a cycle of death and life becayse they'll never despawn if you can't live long enough for them to despawn.

I didn't write this review simply to be a contrarian jerk. \n\nVideogames age, some more than others. At times, all it takes is for a game to receive a sequel, in order for its age to become readily apparent. Torchlight II improves on the original in every conceivable way. I'll even go as far as to say that Torchlight has been rendered obsolete. There's literally no reason to play Torchlight 1 over its sequel, or over the great many other loot-heavy action RPGs that have been released over the years.\n\nThe absolute biggest problem with this game is the difficulty curve. I played through this game on normal, and for 9/10ths of the game, there wasn't any challenge. However, once I got to the final portion of the game, I started running into Dark Zealots. Dark Zealots have auto-targeting instant lightning. All it takes is a couple crits and I die. I admit that my lightning resistance wasn't up to snuff, but the fact that this attack is completely unavoidable is ridiculous. Once Dark Zealots start appearing, they're bound to show up fairly often throughout the post-game. I was on the 5th floor of the Shadow Vault and a Dark Zealot's lightning brought me from full health to death. \n\nI played through Torchlight II on hard difficulty. A veteran is likely to pop in here and say \"That's still way too easy.\" but hear me out. Torchlight II on hard was more consistent than Torchlight 1 on normal. The game remained fairly challenging (for me) throughout the entirety of the main campaign. I didn't sleepwalk through the game, nor did I suddenly get a heaping helping of horse manure towards the end of it and beyond.\n\nBy the way, why does Ordrak have 3 billion HP? Why can he summon countless dragons and skeletons? I'm positively boggled that anyone signed off on this nonsense of a finale. The ludicrousness of the final boss really stands out, when every other boss dies in a minute or two. Torchlight 2 was more consistent when it came to bosses.\n\nLoot. Now I know it's difficult to expect good loot. There is the almighty RNG, and I've never been very lucky. Nevertheless, there is a rhyme and reason to how this system should work, and players should feel like their time is rewarded, especially when they defeat bosses or discover secret rooms. Instead, you're just as likely to get a weapon that's usable for half the game as you are to not find any decent armor upgrades for 3/4s of the game. AGAIN, Torchlight II is more consistent. \n\nTorchlight II also has better quest-design, exploration, map-design, classes, skills, monster-variety, and so on and so forth. It's practically a revelation by comparison. \n\nNow I could download a couple mods to fix the Dark Zealot's insane lightning, or drop Ordrak's HP to something manageable, or improve the myriad of other things that need improving, but that's not my idea of a fun time. Mods are at their best when they add to a game, not just fix its problems. Besides, I already own the sequel. At this point, there really isn't an excuse not to. Torchlight II enjoys sizable discounts during all of the major Steam sales.\n\nOn the bright side, when I review Torchlight II (eventually); I won't have to spend the entirety of it discussing why it's a better game than the prequel.", "timestamp_created": 1465231657, "timestamp_updated": 1465241729, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653243303298950195", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23334115": {"recommendationid": "23334115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244366700", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1465744788}, "language": "english", "review": "I just got this game and I just want to say, it\\'s totally worth the price.

You may think of Torchlight as of much upgraded towards the more comfortable gameplay version of the Fate... And as of next of kin to Diablo Hellfire. And made by the same people, creators of Diablo and Fate.\nTorchlight is not a \"Diablo-killer\", as it goes with so many projects like Titan Quest, Sacred and so many others. On the contrary, Torchlight is actually made all this race to beat the fame of Diablo 1&2 looking even more out-of-order. As you don't need to be better than somebody else. You just need to be fun and complete all by yourself. And Torchlight is just that kind of game - with satysfying content, challenges, variety of features, and general fun-out-of-the-game.\nThat I personally liked about Torchlight is the atmosphere, which is both quite reminiscent to the original Diablo, with the nearly same background and music... but much more mild and joyful altogether.\nThat has frightened me there - is the same thing as with the Fate game - the amount of levels below the surface. Even after you'll beat the main scebario nemesis - you still have a long way down before you, with more and more powerful foes and more of the rarest loot.\nAnd it was namely the loot - along with other possibilities to enhance and empower a character - that frightened me the most. Really, while some people are starting to hate Skyrim for the hundreds of hours of adventures, in Torchlight the biggest blackhole, that has eaten the majority of my playtime - was levelling and redistributing items, perks and other enhancements. Yeah, just the same thing for which so many people love RPG systems in the first place - clear numerical system of your hero's progress - made me sick. For it seems so bottomless, that I've dropped the playing at one moment, realising that for every hour of dugeoning I'm spending 2+ hours just orginizing the stuff and making preparations... I'm not saying the game is like this. Actually, you can play it on the flow, and pauses for changing equipment and distributing stats can be as small as you want them to... It's just the way I'm playing the games and living life in general - if I can tune something to go with that in the field, I usually do that, ad perfectum.\n\nSummarizing. Torchlight is the one very nice and enjoyable hack'n'slash dungeon crawler, which can leave uncomfortable only those who can't play action-RPGs, sicked with cartoon-style animation, or completionsts like myself. One last thing to add is that I suggest to start playing right from the hard difficulty, for \"easy\" and \"normal\" settings are somewhat less inspiring.

I remember when this game first came out. Remember too? The graphics were just plain ugly even back then.\nTorchlight's history in short is that most of the Dev team worked on Diablo 1, 2 and every expansion in between. And that is exactly what makes Torchlight a complete failure.\n\n\nFrom the very first second I played it, I didn't like anything. The style, the visuals, the setting.... It feels rushed and unfinished. Normally I do a Pro v Con list but there are no Pros here, so here are just the worst things about Torchlight.\n\n- Linear Gameplay: I can't stress this enough, It may very well be the only thing that's absolutely wrong with this game but it's a big one. Ever played a 2D platformer, like Mario? Well that's just about as linear as you can get. Just go from start to finish, no deviation in between. To have something like that in a 3D game is... is...what? Why? But that's what Torchlight is, constantly. You go down and then you follow the path, follow it, kill every enemy you see and keep following the path.\n\n- Music: Well the town music is very similar if not the same as in Diablo 1 and 2. Because they hired the same guy to make the soundtrack. It shows, it isn't good. They probably thought that it'd be nice to have music that sounds the same as a far superior game. But by doing so, they hit the same note when an awful movie refers to a better movie during the movie.\n\n- Classes: Three character classes...? This is an RPG right? What kind of RPG only has 3 classes? Maybe Torchlight isn't the only one, but it should be. There really isn't an excuse for that, most RPGs already have the same classes over and over. But Torchlight takes the most generic 3 classes too, Melee Ranged and Wizard/Summoner\nNone of which are any fun while running towards the next level down.\n\n- Graphics: I'm not a graphic freak, I honestly don't care about them, choppy framerate? I'm probably the last person to notice, but these GFX?! No! Just no, why is everything squareish? Was the Dev team all like \"We need something round but a dodecahedron is easier to draw.\" I don't think so, don't like it\n\nFinal verdict, Torchlight is nothing more than a Diablo clone. But I've played several clones in my day, this is by far the worst one. Torchlight feels like an empty vessel, like a game without a soul. It has no identity other than the one it tries to be.

Torchlight uses standard mechanisms for character development, but combines them in a unique experience that provides a fun and dynamic game. \n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nIn the relatively small town of Torchlight a mysterious element has caused a bundle of trouble. A special mineral known as Ember, popular for its unique traits, has been corrupted by a dastardly foe. A giant monstrosity has released his evil across the land and has corrupted the Alchemist known as Alric. It is up to you to fight through the layers of the mine and free the town of Torchlight from the evil daemon Ordrak who is forged from the ember the mine withholds. \n\n[b]Campaign:[/b]\nTorchlight provides a relatively linear campaign filled with irrelevant quests that essentially provide a long-winded grind. The main story consists of 35-floors of a mine where each floor generally resembles the next with minor changes to the environment and foes held within. As you battle through the floors the enemies\u2019 levels do not scale with the player; although, they do maintain a good consistency with the player\u2019s level. \nTo help separate the campaign each group of floors are bundled into segments that have portals connecting them: Orden Mines, Necropolis, Estherian Ruins, Tu\u2019Tara Caverns, Molten Prison, Lost Fortress, Black Palace, and Lair.\nEach segment of the campaign contains a main boss which provides a unique battle experience that tests the player\u2019s fortitude and skill.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nTorchlight offers a unique mixture of gaming by providing a generated dungeon element similar to Spelunky with a combat system such as Diablo the game provides a unique experience with each champion play through. In my personal opinion the campaign has little to no replay value when playing the same champion twice as the generated dungeons, although different are relatively the same.\nSimilar to a standard RPG Torchlight provides classes that offer different combat styles: Alchemist, Destroyer, and Vanquisher. The Alchemist is your standard mage class and plays off magic attribute. The Destroyer is your standard fighting class and plays off strength. The Vanquisher is your standard hunter class and plays off dexterity. \nThe gameplay elements are rather cumbersome and can be infuriating at times. There will be more times you will perish because of poor game mechanics than difficult curve. The player is required to move and fight by left-clicking with the mouse. This causes a lot of times where the players champion will run into battle when you actually just want to shoot from distance, this can also be annoying especially with fast moving and smaller enemies. \n\n[b]Hints:[/b][spoiler]\n>Do not waste your gems, using the Duran the Transmuter you can combine smaller gems into powerful gems that will have massive impacts on your champion. \n>Purchase Gems from Triya whenever you get back in town. She will sell them relatively cheap and if you keep using the Duran the Transmuter who doesn\u2019t charge you can make powerful items.\n>Make sure to give your pet two spells, two rings, and a necklace. This will make them more powerful \u2013 I recommend Heal All and Frost.\n>If you\u2019re ever stuck on a level just go back to an earlier part of the Campaign where the enemies are weaker and level up.\n>Make sure to send your pet back to town to sell items and heal up.\n>Defense is an important attribute \u2013 there is no tanking class so all classes need defense. [/spoiler]\n\n[b]Results:[/b]\nI played Torchlight after beating Torchlight II \u2013 this game is fun, but some elements are missing which cause the campaign to drain rather than provide enjoyment. The campaign is formatted in a way that seems like a grind rather than progression. The levels offer very little dynamics, meaning one portion of the campaigns play through is relatively similar to the next. Overall this game is relatively fun, and provides a good bit of enjoyment. It is a single player game and I\u2019d really recommend getting Torchlight II over Torchlight, but if you are interested I\u2019d say try to get this game when it\u2019s on sale.\n\nPros:\n+Lots of gameplay \u2013 estimated 40+ hours.\n+Unique character class with dungeon generation which causes acceptable multi-play through.\n+Pet which provides decent dynamics and intelligent character building.\n+Once the main campaign is completed the game goes on.\n+Two types of leveling: Fame and Experience. Fame gives you points to level your special abilities, while experience gives you points to level both special abilities and character states.\n+Amazing item diversity and item building. Enchanting items allows them to become stronger which makes key items very powerful and effective for building a highly custom character.\n\nCons:\n-Poor controls moving and attacking utilize the same button.\n-No multiplayer\n-Pets stats are relatively low making them not entirely tank or damage.\n-Limited tutorial, this isn\u2019t really that bad unless you are not averse to gaming.\n", "timestamp_created": 1455991036, "timestamp_updated": 1455991036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572286128997802734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21325658": {"recommendationid": "21325658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025141138", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 910, "last_played": 1590173222}, "language": "english", "review": "It might get a little bit repetitive some times, but it's a great game", "timestamp_created": 1455916694, "timestamp_updated": 1455916694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21324751": {"recommendationid": "21324751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085607006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2887, "last_played": 1456561193}, "language": "english", "review": "Mindless entertainment, but pretty good at it and definately better than television.\nIn general I would give it 'up' but unfortunately there is a problem that I have encountered. \nI have aggravated a lot of creatures' which now camp on the respawn spot and I am being killed in 2 seconds after clicking Continue button. \nCannot reset the level because for some fuck knows reason the console is deactivated on Steam.

De hecho lo recomiendo, sobre todo con las pasivas. \n[/list]\nLa forma de subir niveles es la cl\u00e1sica de cualquier juego de este tipo: matando monstruos y completando misiones. Cuando subamos de nivel podremos elegir una habilidad y repartir 5 puntos de experiencia entre fuerza, destreza, magia y defensa.

The world was still waiting for Blizzard to deliver the next Diablo, and so, this was well-timed.  (Runic went on to release Torchlight2 at around the same time that Diablo3 came out.) It also has a pretty deep mod community, though I'll admit that I played the game vanilla on my playthrough.\n\nThe game is polished: graphics aged fine, clean audio helps the game feel immersive and responsive, and the game runs smoothly on my high-end gaming rig. Did not try it on anything else, but I suspect it'll run just fine. The story is nothing new, but then again -- you're not really playing this game for the story. It's a game where you diablo diablo diablo til you diablo diablo diablo, while you diablo diablo diablo... diablo. In that aspect, the game entertained me 'til the end. According to the in-game panel, that was about 12 hours.\n\nOne point of emphasis: the game difficulty runs easy. If you want a challenging game in which you engage all the mechanics, I'd highly suggest you nudge the difficulty up. In my playthrough, I didn't touch any of the optional map-fragment dungeons; simply the main dungeon and the ones that Hatch opens for you, in his Quest For Many Things. My character's levels almost always matched the number of the main dungeon floor I was on. Though I do have a habit of clearing each floor completely, I shouldn't have been overleveled for any part of the game. And yet, I never had to use a mana potion or any of the various mana shrines. Didn't touch a health potion until L25, and even then rarely. Never had to fiddle with my pet's form -- simply used him as a carryall back to town to sell my items. (So, that took the need to fish right out of the picture.) I had no real use for my currency. (Game only has one -- gold.) I was one-shotting enemies with the gear I found on the ground. I cannot imagine the devs intended for you to three-shot their bosses. At some point toward the end, I just decided to put 100k gold into enchanting a single item, you know, for funsies. I suspect the devs had intended for the enchantment system to work as a gold sink, but I simply didn't need the stat boosts to make the game less challenging. I'm afraid it would have become boring.\n\nI never once used any spells. I also didn't bother learning any non-passive class skills outside of the first available frost shot. Once I learned that, that's what I left my secondary attack on.\n\nPerhaps it was simply because I'd built up a ranged, spike character and the dungeons are designed with bottlenecks galore (hallways and corners everywhere, weeee), but giving the ranged player a NPC tank, a single-target spike, AND a piercing crowd-control projectile so very early in the game may have been overkill.\n\nEven if you haven't played a Diablo before, turn the difficulty up a bit.\n\nOther small notes:\nPet pathing. I realize this is sticky for many devs to get right, but boy -- my pet did not know how to go up stairs when the stairs were perhaps seven feet away from him. It's a small irritant, of course, since I could simply spend the 5 seconds moving around to manipulate his pathing algorithm.\nReplayability. Once you beat the game with any class, a new \"Shadow Dungeon\" opens up. I fully admit that I will not be playing the game again (I have far too many other things to get to!) but that along with being able to \"retire\" a character to pass along a heirloom makes it seem as though the replayability is solid.

You can adjust the difficutly setting and whether it's hardcore so you can tailor the game to be as hard or casual as you like.  And if the price bothers you, wait for one of the ever-present Steam bundle sales and get it at half off!    \n\nI recommend this game.

Among an ample of cool things in game mechanics, balance and combat system that is newly oldish, having just the perfect balance, you will find one of the key elements that Diablo I and II had but III did not: master composer Matt Uelmen who single handedly created the atmosphere here with his amazing tracks.

Put some good miles on my left mouse button with this game and enjoyed most of it. It can be casual fun or challenging fun. With four difficulties to choose from and a \"hardcore\" mode on each of the four, you'll find the challenge for you. The story line is simple, the quests are simple, and the gameplay mechanics are simple. But they're all tight and smooth. And there's plenty of fun left to be had after the main quest. You can get as much as you want from this title. \n\nThe loot is my only complaint. The amount of loot in the game is absolutely insane. It makes something like Borderlands look like child's play. And the thing is, amongst the giant mess there actually is consistently a piece of armor, a trinket, or a weapon worth your while. So you find yourself picking up and picking through nearly everything. I fear for the more compulsive looters out there, as picking up 100% of the loot will fill your inventory completely 1 to 2 times per dungeon floor! And this includes your pet's inventory slots as well. The one feature added to manage this is the ability to send your pet back to town on its own to sell it's entire inventory contents with a simple click on a button.

If you've played Diablo II, Torchlight will feel very familiar, especially considering a large makeup of the team consists of the Diablo crew. Thus comparisons between the two are inevitable.\n\nYour character comes to the town of Torchlight, a mining town that excavates a hot commodity known as Ember. As with all mysterious forms of power, Ember appears to come at a cost, and it is up to you to investigate. Pretty standard story, it's just there to provide an excuse for you to go hunting for monsters and loot.\n\nYou are offered three basic classes - a melee fighter, an archer, and a mage. Each class comes with three skill trees. Though some skills, generally passive ones, are universal to all classes, so it's more like every class has two trees. Skill allocations are permament. There are no synergy bonuses in this game, so once a skill becomes obsolete, it becomes wasted points. On the other hand, if you are gunning for speedy playthroughs, then it's a good idea to spend points early on.\n\nEnchanting items provides a nifty way to add small bonuses to the items you find for a small fee. However, each additional enchantment increases the odds that EVERYTHING will be stripped from it. I am totally against this design. I wish it instead stripped the item down to its base form. You could spend hundreds of hours making one awesome heirloom, only to have it accidentally disenchanted because of one button press. It doesn't help that I'd swear the quoted disenchant chance is bogus. If my math is right, you should theoretically have a 73% chance to succeed on 5 attempts with the regular enchanter, not counting attempts that result no change. It feels like I failed more than that. \n\nTorchlight has a rather fascinating retirement system. After you've beaten the game, you are given the option to retire the character at any time, and choose one item to gain enhanced stats. It's a neat method to encourage replaying, and I would have loved to take advantage of it, but each playthrough of the game just feels so long and samey, that I couldn't bring myself to do it.\n\nOne thing that bothered me about the game is how short buffs are. A haste buff for example lasts for 8 seconds, and then you have to recast it. Considering you have to briefly stand still to cast it, it's rarely worth the effort. Class buffs are more potent, but they require frequent recasting as well.\n\nTorchlight is a pretty game. They did a good job on modeling, and it's got some nice cartoony aesthetics. The music is very Diabloesque, considering it was written by the same person. I did encounter some annoyances with the game engine. Shooting up and down stairs is oddly problematic, as your shots will often stray off or hit the stairs instead of the target. Summons also have a tendency to gather into a wall to try to attack something. Some npcs have curiously large interaction ranges, thus when you exit their screen, you end up talking to them because you clicked too close. Other than that the game runs pretty well.\n\nI give Torchlight a 7.5/10. While I don't deny the game is well-done, the sheer repetitiveness of killing dozens of enemies the same way often made me zone out and go into autopilot. It doesn't help that the later floors stretch for so long, and there's few methods to speed things up. Diablo 2 suffers from this as well, to some extent. Torchlight is a good game if you need to scratch that Diablo itch, but some part of me would also just rather play Diablo 2.", "timestamp_created": 1448751448, "timestamp_updated": 1448751448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19341207": {"recommendationid": "19341207", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970532603", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 1063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1063, "last_played": 1344841200}, "language": "english", "review": "Like Diablo, but more streamlined?

It features Diablo-esque gameplay with a cartoonish art style.\n\nThere is not much to say about the story: Torchlight is a mining town where a magic mineral called Ember is stored. Alric, once an adventurer like you*, has been corrupted by the [strike]One Ring[/strike] tainted Ember and [strike]fell to the Dark Side[/strike] went rogue. You are to enter the depths of the underworld and track him down. The gameplay is solid and focuses on going deeper down while completing quests and eviscerating thousands of nasty creatures. The setting is an interesting mix of medieval fantasy and steampunk: magic and swords meet robots and firearms. One should not be surprised to see a robot bard who gives monster contracts.\n\nThere is a classic trinity: a warrior (Destroyer, male), a rogue (Vanquisher, female), and a sorcerer (Alchemist, male). Each of the classes have 3 skill trees which provide a player with a variety of playstyles. Unlike in Diablo, some skills are shared among the classes (e.g. passive skills which provide an xp boost, dual wielding damage bonus, etc.). What is also unique is that every character can learn to use various spells (up to four at a time). Wanna be a dual axe wielding Destroyer who can also cast fireballs on demand? No problem!\n\nThe art style is pretty much timeless: the graphics are decent even now (there are texture mods should anyone be interested). Even though there is not much freedom to explore, randomly generated dungeons are diverse enough to keep one entertained for hours. Moreover, the game is paced just about right \u2013 the \"just one more level\" phenomenon is real. Speaking of art, the soundtrack is just astounding which is hardly a surprise. It was composed by Matt Uelmen, the author of Diablo's soundtrack.\n\nIt is a shame that there is no multiplayer, as gathering a group and venturing forth is a staple for action RPGs. The only companion a player will go with is a pet: either a cat or a dog. Pets can support you in a fight, cast spells (up to two at a time), and go to town to sell your items. The player can also feed them fish which make them change into different creatures. Speaking of downsides, there is no character customisation.\n\nIn conclusion, Torchlight is a marvellous action RPG which can provide hours and hours of highly enjoyable gameplay. One should do themselves a favour and play this gem.\n\n*Wait, wrong game.\n\nP.S.

What the game does get right though, is the actual gameplay.  Combat is a joy, and honestly you rarely mind grinding through the same early stages as you try to progress deeper down into the dungeon.  My typical play session stretched to several hours and I think I burned through this game in two weeks, so that gives you an idea of how addicting the combat is.  Multiple classes, a great concept of a helper pet, and bright visuals make for a fun time.  If you can only pick up one game though, I would recommend the vastly superior sequel.

It's a fun hack-n-slash game that's vibrant in colors and art style but lacking in the story department. However, once you complete the game there isn't much else to do, considering the levels are limited to the small town and the different levels of the mines. However, it's good for about 30 hours of gameplay. With hundreds of weapons, \n\nPros:\n- Art style. The game is colorful and beautiful to look at. It is a bit cartoony, but that's what makes it fun. The UI is nice and clean, which helps when there's a lot of things happening.\n- Gameplay. While you do have your mouse buttons for attacks, you also have the number buttons which allow for spells and other interesting enchantments.\n- Companions. The pet companion is perhaps one of the best features in the game. It acts like a second person following you. It'll help you attack enemies and even cast spells. It'll also go back to town and sell your unwanted items, which makes it a lot more convenient instead of going all the way back and selling your items directly.\n- Optimization. The game runs as smooth as butter. I never experienced any sort of frame drops or bugs/crashes at all.\n- Item custimization. There are endless amounts of armor and weapons that you can get which you can either sell or use for yourself. \n\nCons:\n- Story. The story is kind of barebones at times. While the main premise of the game isn't the story, it's not something I can go without saying.

I enjoyed it, but there were some things that just nagged at me while I played it. Unfortunately, the more I played it, the less I liked it. Going further and further into the game did not increase my enjoyment. And I ultimately stopped playing.\n\nSadly that perfectly describes my most recent experience with Torchlight.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to figure out just what it is that I don\u2019t like, but every time I formulate my thoughts I come up with the same conclusion:\n\nThe game feels hollow and generic.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to have it\u2019s own identity or stand out as unique from other games in the ARPG genre. Hell, Torchlight is essentially an \u201cHD remake\u201d of Diablo from 1996\u2026 without the \u201cHell.\u201d The game follows the same basic progression and is, in many ways the same game, but with less of an edge.\n\nI feel that really hurts Torchlight.\n\nPlenty of games can be fun without a cool in-game world or a \u201cgritty\u201d story hook to pull you in. It\u2019s gameplay that matters in the end, right? Sadly I think that Torchlight also falls flat here as well.\n\nTorchlight is pretty a pretty shallow game, to its detriment. Killing monsters is fun in its own right, but only for so long. Other ARPGs alleviate this by giving you things to work for: new more powerful items, more powerful skills, harder challenges, etc. Torchlight does have all of these things\u2026 they\u2019re just not interesting. So although the game does have the \u201ccarrot on a stick\u201d incentive to continue playing\u2026 I\u2019m, sadly, not interested in the carrot.\n\nI found the gameplay to be rather lackluster and boring. Torchlight\u2019s art style does not appeal to me. The environments lacked feeling, and ultimately felt sterile. The items in the game were shallow, and only the \u201cunique\u201d items had any flavor. The various character skills weren\u2019t very impressive, and didn\u2019t feel very powerful.\n\nBut let\u2019s break down the individual pieces of Torchlight and critique it against the five points I mentioned previously.\n\nAtmosphere and Story\n\nAtmosphere\n\nthe pervading tone or mood of a place, situation, or work of art.\n\nTorchlight has little to no atmosphere. Certain areas in the game look pretty darn cool, but carry absolutely no feeling.\n\nMy favorite areas are a necropolis found underneath the mines beneath Torchlight (Yes, that\u2019s the name of the town) and the underground jungle-temple ruins beneath the necropolis. Why I like these two areas over all the others? Probably because they have the most \u2018flavor\u2019. But even then it\u2019s spread pretty thin.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to be said about the game\u2019s various locales other than that they don\u2019t make much sense and require a bit too much suspension of disbelief for my taste.\n\nStory\nan account of imaginary or real people and events told for entertainment.\n\nI consider story to be tied very closely with atmosphere, and like Torchlight\u2019s atmosphere, there isn\u2019t really much to be said about the story. It\u2019s pretty generic and could be summarized in two sentences: \u201cTorchlight was built over a corrupted source of magic caused by an ancient evil deep within the Earth. Go kill it.\u201d\n\nMore accurately: The town of Torchlight is mining a substance called Ember, which allows for the various forms of magic in the world, but it turns out the Ember under Torchlight is corrupt and will turn anyone who comes into contact with it evil! This is because the Ember Vein runs over an ancient evil, later revealed to be a dragon. You are called to Torchlight to help the mining operation, which is being attacked by monsters, but are promptly betrayed by the man who summoned you. As it turns out he wants to revive the dragon sleeping beneath Torchlight. And you, the hero, have to stop him by traveling deeper and deeper into the Earth uncovering older and older civilizations that fell to the corrupting allure of the Ember.\n\nPretty good ideas! Not going to lie, there\u2019s definitely a cool story in there. But it\u2019s really only used as an occasional spur to remind you to continue murdering monsters as you travel what seems like miles into the earth. A shame, really.\n\nThere is very little involvement in the story, and to be honest the voice acting is pretty hammy. If you like that sort of thing, then good on ya! I had to skip most of it.\n\nBut hey, atleast you can skip it! Actually all of it! Which is nice.\n\nEnemies\nthe persons who are actively opposed or hostile to someone or something.\n\nUnfortunately, the enemies in torchlight are boring. There isn\u2019t any way around it. I don\u2019t like their designs, and none of them really seem to have any interesting mechanics to differentiate them. They\u2019re all just bigger and bigger punching bags. Some will revive their comrades, and some will leave noxious fumes after death. But by and large, the majority of them are meat sacks that fling their bodies against your weapons.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the enemies have massive spikes in difficulty towards the end of the game. There is a LARGE increase in enemy health and damage in the last area. And every time I\u2019ve played, it has come as a shock.\n\nI\u2019ll be doing just fine, then I\u2019ll walk into the last section of the game and be murdered. Only to find that I\u2019m unable to deal significant damage to the enemies. Their scaling seems to be off, and it\u2019s just not fun.\n\nYour Character\n\nthe representation or expression of something in a tangible or visible form.\n\nTorchlight utilizes the typical stat system. Your RPG standards are all present: Strength, Dexterity, Magic, Life, and Defense. Every time you level, the game gives you five points to allocate to each of these different parameters. Unfortunately it seems like the various stat points are really just a way of directing your progression. It didn\u2019t seem as though loading a bunch of points into Magic made my Alchemist\u2019s magic any more powerful, despite it being his main damage stat. It seemed as though it was just a holdover from previous games. \u201cDiablo had them, so Torchlight will too.\u201d\n\nReally the stats just felt like numbers I had to inflate in order to put on different armor. My character\u2019s power seemed to be located in the weapons and armor he was wearing rather than the character himself.\n\nSkills\n\nskill or expertise in a particular activity or field\n\nTorchlight also follows a rather traditional skill tree format, present in almost every ARPG. Ever.\nThat\u2019s perfectly fine. Skill trees are used so commonly because they work. Sadly, the skills in Torchlight are boring. Plain and simple. The coolest spells I got for my Alchemist were Chain Lightning and a laser. Everything else rather boring.\n\nI think that is was a major contributing factor to why Torchlight felt boring to me. The three different classes all had pretty boring skills. Nothing really stands out, and everything felt pretty lame.\n\nItemization\n\nthe balance and distribution of items, their types, and the various effects, powers, and statistics attached to them\n\nLast but not least, the items. Again, there isn\u2019t a lot to say. Torchlight\u2019s items were rather lacking. Most items are of the, \u201c+10 fire damage,\u201d \u201c+20 lightning damage,\u201d \u201c+5% attack speed\u201d variety. Nothing to write home about.\n\nThis is probably the one aspect of the game where Torchlight tried its hardest to please me.\n\nI received about 7 unique items before reaching level 15. Unique items are Torchlight\u2019s highest rarity item, apparently. They were all decent, and some of the unique wands I found had cool effects that altered combat, like shots bouncing and releasing arcs of electricity on the ground. But they were little more than more powerful versions of the base items. Not particularly exciting.\n\nBoring skills, boring monsters, boring items, boring combat.\n\nVery sad indeed.", "timestamp_created": 1444109364, "timestamp_updated": 1444109441, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439149916172027588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18291818": {"recommendationid": "18291818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058159844", "num_games_owned": 1030, "num_reviews": 275, "playtime_forever": 5347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4036, "last_played": 1630144499}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't really play games like [i]Torchlight[/i]. The style of action RPG proliferated by titles like [i]Diablo[/i] never really interested me. It's mostly just a repetitive slog of killing and looting identical enemies who changed only statistically, becoming incrementally more difficult so as to retain the same amount of effort required for their deaths. While [i]Torchlight[/i] is all that and more, it managed to keep me entertained for quite some time through diverse enemy types, artistic direction and engaging skill trees.\n\nThe gameplay hardly needs explaining - it's like [i]Diablo[/i]. You control most everything in the game using the mouse and some hotkeys. I chose to play as the 'vanquisher' class, focusing on ranged weaponry and magic related to it. The abilities of this class mostly serve to complement her ranged weapons, and I managed to completely finish the game without even equipping a melee weapon. I did find that the class benefited significantly from having summoning spells, allowing players to fire powerful ranged spells at enemies while minions keep them at bay. A lot of the more powerful weapons felt great to use, and I was impressed by the game's lenience toward players interested in multiple gameplay styles--nothing stopped me from summoning an army of skeletons, even though I didn't choose the class focused on that at the start of the game.\n\n[i]Torchlight[/i]'s balancing feels fine, though later levels do feature some enemies with huge damage output that were a pain to get past. I really liked the way the game's entire story takes place in a single dungeon, with the player's gradual descent into the earth beneath the titular town slowly revealing different fortresses and ancient ruins all lying beneath the ground. The game begins with entry into the mine upon which Torchlight's economy is reliant upon, but before the game's end you'll see a sprawling necropolis, colourful, flooded ruins and a fiery dwarven fortress. The graphical diversity keeps things interesting, and everything's quite pretty too. I liked the cartoony art style, but I found it quite curious how many enemies were simply recoloured, buffed up a bit and reused.\n\nOn release, some criticised [i]Torchlight[/i] for it's lack of any form of multiplayer component. I personally found this to be a good decision, as a single-player game tends to be more focused. [i]Torchlight[/i], despite the admirable streamlining of UI and gameplay still contains a large amount of engaging content, even after the final boss. I just don't know if [i]Torchlight[/i] will be one of those games that the average player can get a huge amount of mileage out of--while I found the content to be sufficient, it certainly does get old after a certain point.", "timestamp_created": 1443798183, "timestamp_updated": 1490593770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751304447650909424", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18288563": {"recommendationid": "18288563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047369804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1342422000}, "language": "english", "review": "Fine", "timestamp_created": 1443782588, "timestamp_updated": 1443782588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18286081": {"recommendationid": "18286081", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995601606", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 3620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3620, "last_played": 1336546800}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun", "timestamp_created": 1443764579, "timestamp_updated": 1443764579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498545914888381958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18260070": {"recommendationid": "18260070", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998462264", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 3255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2592, "last_played": 1557921328}, "language": "english", "review": "still holds up as a pretty decent ARPG. \nIf you haven't played it yet, pick it up in a sale and give it a go.", "timestamp_created": 1443601936, "timestamp_updated": 1443601936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18225171": {"recommendationid": "18225171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051637216", "num_games_owned": 638, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1227, "last_played": 1348902000}, "language": "english", "review": "This and the sequel are fantastic Diablo-esque games.
