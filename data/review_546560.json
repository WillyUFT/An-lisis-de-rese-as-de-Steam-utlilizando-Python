Developed by Valve Corporation, this installment in the iconic Half-Life series has set a new standard for immersive gameplay and storytelling within the VR landscape.\n\nGraphics and Immersion: 5/5\nThe visual fidelity of Half-Life: Alyx is nothing short of breathtaking. From the intricate details of the environment to the lifelike character animations, every aspect of the game is designed to draw players into the dystopian world of City 17. The Source 2 engine truly shines, delivering an unparalleled level of realism that enhances the overall immersion.\n\nGameplay: 4.5/5\nThe gameplay mechanics of Half-Life: Alyx are a testament to the potential of VR gaming. The intuitive controls, precise interactions, and realistic physics create an experience that feels both natural and responsive. The game cleverly integrates VR features, requiring players to physically reach for items, solve puzzles, and engage in combat with a level of tactility that traditional gaming can't match.\n\nStory and Atmosphere: 4.5/5\nTrue to the legacy of the Half-Life series, Alyx doesn't disappoint in terms of narrative depth and atmosphere. The storytelling is engaging, weaving seamlessly into the existing lore while introducing new characters and plot twists. The oppressive ambiance of City 17 is palpable, and the game succeeds in maintaining a sense of tension throughout the entire experience.\n\nSound Design: 5/5\nThe audio in Half-Life: Alyx is a standout feature, contributing significantly to the overall atmosphere. From the haunting echoes of distant Combine chatter to the subtle creaking of dilapidated buildings, every sound is meticulously crafted. The use of 3D audio technology further enhances the sense of space and directionality, adding another layer to the immersive experience.\n\nVR Innovation: 5/5\nHalf-Life: Alyx pushes the boundaries of what VR can achieve. It not only demonstrates the potential for narrative-driven VR games but also serves as a showcase for innovative design and interaction possibilities within the medium. The game sets a new standard for VR titles and has undoubtedly paved the way for future developments in the industry.\n\nHalf-Life: Alyx is a tour de force in virtual reality gaming.

It's not a cut-down experience made to work with VR, it's a full-fledged VR game. Unfortunately, so many years in, that's still the case. There are some issues with weapon handling that could be improved, but a lot of that comes down to bulky and inaccurate controllers.\n\nAs for the negatives, I'm not a fan of ammo-scarcity in games, and this game has a TON of it. Weapons don't seem to have enough power to taken anything down without hitting very small hit boxes (again, bulky and inaccurate controllers), so I find myself using a lot more ammo than I would otherwise. And when you do find ammo, it's one mag here, two shotgun shells there, etc. Occasionally, you'll find an ammo box, but that usually means you're about to fight a bunch of enemies, so you'll be out again soon.\n\nThe biggest issue I have is with performance. Every so often after the game loads I'll drop down to 10fps, and nothing seems to get it to go back to normal. I'll have to completely shut everything down and start it back up again. Also, even worse, sometimes the game will completely lock up my entire computer to the extent that I have to hard reset. It's the only VR game I have this issue with, and it's a very serious issue.

It has a perfect difficulty, insane sound design, and best of all, the gun textures. I have never, and  I mean never seen a VR game with gun textures as high res as this. The reflections are amazing, the feedback from the AI of the enemies and even the feedback from your controllers haptics adds to the immersion. You don't even need a 2000$ headset to enjoy this game, in my first playthrough I used a 300$ quest three.

It really provides the full action-rpg experience i'd expect from a large studio, and is definitely a feel of Half-Life in the newer age\nThere's very little bad to say about the core game, it provides most VR options and has thought through a lot of the ways this game can be experienced\n\nGame wise its a simple-ish action game, from tense dark scenes to grand almost cut scene level visuals all in VR which is very impressive and just like VR, very difficult to explain without \"being there\"\nIt's also one of the longest VR games i've played really (around 10 - 15 hours YMMV). Other VR games are 30mins - 1hr of either roguelike rounds or just the full experience, and i'm tired of that. \n\nWith Half-Life Alyx I can really see in the right hardware going for full sessions of 4+ hours, and I can see with the Quest 3 + hardware accessories, you could really get there\n\nIf there's only up from here we're in for a good time!", "timestamp_created": 1699214075, "timestamp_updated": 1699214075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149605124": {"recommendationid": "149605124", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990057435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 838, "last_played": 1699157781}, "language": "english", "review": "Need a follow up to this game!", "timestamp_created": 1699208509, "timestamp_updated": 1699208509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149604930": {"recommendationid": "149604930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005685425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 828, "last_played": 1674367958}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games to play on VR", "timestamp_created": 1699208285, "timestamp_updated": 1699208285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149596171": {"recommendationid": "149596171", "author": {"steamid": "76561199058861173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 386, "playtime_at_review": 906, "last_played": 1700171181}, "language": "english", "review": "gud game i think", "timestamp_created": 1699199659, "timestamp_updated": 1699199659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497942358255386353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149594168": {"recommendationid": "149594168", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981810173", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1945, "last_played": 1659294639}, "language": "english", "review": "By far the best implementation of a VR game opposed to the other good VR titles that are hardly more than a tech demo.

Introducing Half-Life: Alyx, the game where you constantly feel like you're on a desperate scavenger hunt for bullets. And no, it's not Half-Life 3, so let's just get that out of the way before someone starts a rumor!\n\nIn this thrilling VR escapade, you'll be facing off against adversaries, only to look down and realize: \"Wait, where did all my ammo go?!\" You defeat them, only to run low again. And then you move on, triumphantly... and yep, you guessed it, you're out of ammo. Again. Makes you wonder if the game secretly doubled as a rationing lesson. (I swear I wasn't trying to shoot stars out of the sky, but a gamer can dream, right?)\n\nBut don't let the sporadic scarcity of bullets fool you. The graphics? Immaculate. The gameplay? Seamless. The feeling of desperately searching for ammo while an alien is chasing you? Priceless. Or should I say... bulletless?\n\nIf you've ever wanted to experience what it's like to be both awed and mildly irritated at the same time, then Half-Life: Alyx is the game for you. The VR mechanics are spot on, and aside from occasionally wanting to scream, \"WHERE IS THE AMMO?!\", you're in for an authentic and enthralling Half-Life adventure.

What better game to really sink my teeth into other than Valve's foray into a full-length VR experience? Well I can hardly think of a better example, this game is fantastic. I have little experience with VR so I'm not sure how to describe it, but the combat and exploration in this game is immersive and really fun. The levels, weapons, random items to mess with, and enemies all interact and look exactly how you think it would FEEL. I cannot praise the attention to detail enough.\n\nYet despite this, Half-life Alyx manages to still be very accessible with different movement options, simple weapon mechanics, and no weird inventory fiddling. If you have any experience with video games, I could totally recommend this as your first large VR game and I think you'd find it easy enough to get into. Actually, that's maybe the biggest praise I could give HLA. Even if this game wasn't VR, I still would've enjoyed it a ton.

Graphics are incredible with the fancy Source 2 engine, displaying highly detailed character models with impressive facial animation. Physics have been improved greatly, being able to fully show the realistic weight of certain objects. And while certain beloved characters such as Barney and Kleiner don't make a return, we're introduced to a British chap named Russel, who's still as enjoyable as those we've seen in Half Life 2. Plus, and this isn't a spoiler, but it expands on the story despite being a prequel :)\nMy only gripes with the game is that it's incredibly laggy on slightly lower-end systems, and you'd need the Valve Index to truly experience this game to it's fullest. And while it does make sense to have it be geared for extremely high-end systems and build the game off of the headset your company made, it's frustrating to have to know what graphics card you need to run the game on just the lowest settings and not be bombarded with lagspikes. I use a GTX 1070 on 32 gigs of ram with the Oculus Rift S and can barely get an extremely clear, smooth image.\nBut despite those, I love this game. It's one of the last games to fully revolutionize gaming as we've reached our limit at this point. Can't wait to see what Half Life 3 will have to offer once we get to that point. Valve isn't very well-known for making games in a small timeframe, but that just shows their dedication. We had almost a whole decade of nothing but updates for Team Fortress 2 and CS:GO. And seeing how they treated TF2 after Jungle Inferno, it's best to assume we have a lot to look forward to in the rest of this decade.", "timestamp_created": 1698037462, "timestamp_updated": 1698037462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148713137": {"recommendationid": "148713137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023601547", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1698035423}, "language": "english", "review": "Wish it worked on Linux.

[/i]\n\n[h3] Introduction [/h3]\nTo this day, hands down the best PCVR experience the money can buy. Even if you are not familiar with the Half-Life franchise, give it a chance; you will unlikely be disappointed. If you care deeply about the performance aspect and worry if your setup can handle it - the game is highly optimized and rarely causes any frame drops. After all, a refund is always a possibility. The trailer will never do it for you in the same way the game could.\n\n[h3] Story & World Building [/h3]\nAll the details within make this world feel truly alive, unlike any other VR environment that looks fake at a glance. The pure quality of assets used and clever level design together play a great role in immersing you as a player. The narrative is delivered seamlessly; you are always present in the world, and it actually responds to your actions. Intensive scenes are executed perfectly, and the VR itself adds much more depth than you can ever imagine.\n\n[h3] Compatibility Concerns [/h3]\nBeing originally designed to showcase the true spectrum of VR interactions Index is capable of, the game holds well when it comes to other headsets and conrollers. Unique features like squeezing the palm of your hand while holding an object were simply rebinded to an action button within your reach. It means that regardless of your current VR setup, the game will adapt and provide as much content as it can without leaving some of it behind.\n\n[h3] Conclusion & Final Notes [/h3]\nThe magnitude of hard work and dedication that the Valve team put in when making this game can never be expressed enough. It is a unique, mesmerizing, and engaging experience that will last you hours upon hours and will still be able to surprise you, catch you off guard. Words don't do justice at this point, and if you made it this far - treat yourself and explore the world of Half-Life: Alyx to its fullest.", "timestamp_created": 1697019551, "timestamp_updated": 1697019551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148010567": {"recommendationid": "148010567", "author": {"steamid": "76561199197072260", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1698987825}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hermoso", "timestamp_created": 1696999586, "timestamp_updated": 1696999586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148010401": {"recommendationid": "148010401", "author": {"steamid": "76561199334073982", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1697027888}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun yes hehe spent a thousand bucks to play yes", "timestamp_created": 1696999218, "timestamp_updated": 1696999218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148009931": {"recommendationid": "148009931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009567040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1042, "last_played": 1697940031}, "language": "english", "review": "The perfect VR game with a mix of environment, story and action.

A stunning return to one of my favourite universes. Some truly god-like design and world building; driven by a fun engaging cast. Seriously the voice work here is fantastic. It even expands on ideas that never really got explored in HL2. \n\nDo know going in, it plays a lot more like a survival horror game crossed with a walking sim than the rest of Half Life; and the combine soldiers; while having a superb visual rework are kind of dumb as bricks.  \n\nIt does admittingly play it a little safe at points; the monster variety is good but limited; There's only 4 weapons, pacing is excellent but and it could be gone for a few more hours IMO.  \n\nThe No-VR mod is damn good for what it it's; yes, it is very janky and crashes at points, but the pure half-life experience is faithfully maintained. Immense credit to the Mod developers for giving many who cannot financially or medically afford to buy what is still just a piece of gimmick tech a chance to experience this game.

object you're holding, it almost feels like you are actually holding things at times. Fights are fun with the combine, the different types of enemies poke at your play style and you must adapt to their presence. The weapons feel right at home, even though they are all one handed, from the pistol to the [spoiler] SMG [/spoiler], they feel just as good as all the other games, hell even better at most. Also, the puzzles in the game are very good, they have a sense of difficulty to them, but are not too hard to figure out.\nIn my ratings, this game is a solid 9/10 \nwhy not a 10 you might ask? the only simple reason is you cant do a lot of actions yourself, which in itself, is perfectly fine as it was done in the sake of comfort of new users. but as a pretty good VR player, who doesnt throw up when the game moves them without player action, it feels... restricting.. but other than that, the game itself is an ABSOLUTE GEM! get it now.", "timestamp_created": 1696719671, "timestamp_updated": 1699939587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147816011": {"recommendationid": "147816011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113115823", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1182, "last_played": 1696728816}, "language": "english", "review": "best vr ive played", "timestamp_created": 1696699765, "timestamp_updated": 1696699765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147815504": {"recommendationid": "147815504", "author": {"steamid": "76561199234643294", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 818, "last_played": 1696803951}, "language": "english", "review": "Very immersive game! highly recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1696699185, "timestamp_updated": 1696699185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147795295": {"recommendationid": "147795295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277209710", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1696962077}, "language": "english", "review": "God Did\n", "timestamp_created": 1696677608, "timestamp_updated": 1696677608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147779294": {"recommendationid": "147779294", "author": {"steamid": "76561199214127766", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 554, "last_played": 1696821883}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Half Life game.

Alyx is good. The campaign is 15-ish hours long. This game is not worth the normal price that is like 70e. I got the game when it was at the 66% sale. Which cost me like 20e. The campaign is good, with good, simple puzzels and physics. But the combat is lacking. It is very slow, most of the time youll be ducking behind cover, waiting for the enemies to be done shooting. Yes, this is exactly how the CoD does it. But this is a VR game. You use your whole body to do physical things. Like boneworks. You can use meele weapons to kill enemies. The Graphics are phenomenal, these graphisc are the best to this date. And finally mods, they are fine. Theyll keep you enganged until you get bored of the slow combat.\n\nNow to the longer explenation\n\nCampaing\nI completed the game with around 16 hours. Its a good campaign. It shows of new things almost every level. There arent really any specific levels i didint enjoy. Maybe the later levels because my game was lagging, due to my PC specs. To put it simply, a normal valve campaign, but. Even when the game shows of new things like new enemy types, controls, physics, puzzels and all that. It all is nothing new. Its things we've seen before. No new physics or mechanics. Maybe on thing i really think is cool about the game that i havent seen any other VR game do is that Alyx's hands react to what you are touching, not holding. If you for an example put your hand on a slope. Youll see that her fingers react and follow the pattern/slope. But thats just a visual thing. It doesnt change the gameplay. \n\nCombat/Gameplay\nThe gameplay as mentioned before ,its slow. HIde, shoot, hide, shoot. There isnt really a lot of variety to kill enemies. It really goes down to shooting until they die or throw a grenade. A lot of people say this game is good but isnt nothing new or special. Which is true. Best example i can give is Boneworks. A lot of variety of guns, meeles and with faster combat. There are mods to fix that like the sprint mod. But HA Alyx wanst made for that. It was made to be slow paced combat. Where you hide behind cover to start blasting the enemies after they have run out of ammo. The only thing i will remember HA Alyx for is the graphics, speaking of graphics. \n\nGrapics\nThe graphics are the BEST i have EVER SEEN. My pc couldnt handle the big open areas soo i had to lower the graphics down to low in the settings. And yet it looked phenomenal. Truly the greatest looking VR game to this date. It alos runs pretty smooth. I also had to turn of any background things like spotify, operaGX, steam and soo on, soo that my game wouldnt lag (My PC is a mid-spec or whatever you call it) Overall the graphics were REALLY GOOD. Even when i lowered them the the lowest setting i could it ran pretty smooth. Only the later levels were laggy.\n\nMods\nI have tried a few mods like the bioshock campaings, the continetal map and a few gun replacment mod. They were all good. Thats all i can say about mods since i only have 23 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1695898646, "timestamp_updated": 1695898646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147181156": {"recommendationid": "147181156", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985908171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1232, "last_played": 1695880311}, "language": "english", "review": "still the best vr game out", "timestamp_created": 1695875374, "timestamp_updated": 1695875374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147173428": {"recommendationid": "147173428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395572392", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 1300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 899, "last_played": 1698456043}, "language": "english", "review": "half life", "timestamp_created": 1695865124, "timestamp_updated": 1695865124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147166174": {"recommendationid": "147166174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972874120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 261, "last_played": 1696082628}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, graphics and physics are spot on, recommend the purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1695856400, "timestamp_updated": 1695856400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147162638": {"recommendationid": "147162638", "author": {"steamid": "76561199140407519", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1695853764}, "language": "english", "review": "f", "timestamp_created": 1695852530, "timestamp_updated": 1695852530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147158166": {"recommendationid": "147158166", "author": {"steamid": "76561199080275248", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 3966, "last_played": 1700657632}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the only reason i got a quest 2 \n\nAnd was it worth it hell yeah it was 10/10 game would play again", "timestamp_created": 1695848797, "timestamp_updated": 1695848797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147155002": {"recommendationid": "147155002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048709539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 740, "last_played": 1695777310}, "language": "english", "review": "#1 VR game so far", "timestamp_created": 1695846704, "timestamp_updated": 1695846704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147151928": {"recommendationid": "147151928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992071650", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1095, "last_played": 1688695334}, "language": "english", "review": "Greatest VR game I have ever played.

like 2/3rds of Alyx on a friends HTC Vive (IIRC), so I know what Alyx is like in VR and It was great!!\nBut I cannot last longer for like 1 hour at  a time,  because the headset gets too stressful for my neck and it's mentally so much more demanding for me  than 'flatscreen'-games.\n\n---NON-VR-PERFORMANCE\n -- WINDOWS\n\nThen the No-VR-Mod came along (currently V0.9 installer). Under Windows 10 it works great on my RX 7600. The game is playable at HIGH and ULTRA setings at stable 60Hz (probably more but my TFT does not support more FPS).\nThe Mod turns Alyx in a most seemless NON-VR FPS game. Only issues I had were some minor input-recognition issues on game elements specifically designed for 3D manipulation. \n\n -- LINUX\n - PROTON (non-native Linux version)\nUnder Linux (Ubuntu 23.04) manual installation of the MOD worked only partially for me (no 'Mouse Pointer'/  strange Pointer offset), so I just copied the game files from Windows over into my Linux Steam-library and it worked as expected.\nBut the performance under Linux is not so good, even with Vulkan. On WIndows 10 I got no problems running with HIGH Performance settings, under Linux I get some unstable 40 to 60 FPS in LOW settings and some more minor loading hiccups (no pop-ins).\n\n- NATIVE LINUX VERSION\nI don\"t get the menu at the start of the game, so - no show I am afraid.\n\n--- CONCLUSION\nSo, for all you without Headsets: You can safely enjoy Alyx in non-VR. It's still downright awesome.\nJust download the installer and off you go!", "timestamp_created": 1695402134, "timestamp_updated": 1695605647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146788803": {"recommendationid": "146788803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049527773", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1695398366}, "language": "english", "review": "This game...

Feeding the little alien rat and drawing phalluses on the whiteboard were pretty much my first indications that I was going to have a good time. Although this type of object reaction doesn't exist in the same amount of detail as the first 2 hours of the game, the times where it continued this trend were truly goofy.\n\nThe gunplay was really cool. Though it took a while to get used to as a first VR game, and I learned very early on that saves are your friend for when things go wrong (not very often I have to say this with shooters tbh). Each gun has its own upgrades and styles of reloading that you had to physically reload. It had a perfect balance of immersion and gameplay feel in those aspects. It felt like my ammo was considerably lower at the start of the game, but was then in abundance toward the end. Or maybe I just got better at the game honestly.\n\nNot really into the whole Half-Life lore, the only game I really played extensively was HL-1. But even despite that, Rhys Darby in my ear as Russel made the whole thing a little more lighthearted juxtaposed against the entire world being taken over by the combine. The twist ending was also really good, and made even someone who doesn't care about the lore soyface at their little ending twist. Valve is very good at setting up cliffhanger endings and then never releasing a game afterwards, and they do that really well here too.\n\nAll in all though definitely recommend it, as a VR vet or someone who hasn't played VR before in their life.

I put a spoon into a teacup. it stood up. i put another one on the other side and it also stood up. then i put both spoons on the same side and the cup tipped over. it sounds like an irrelevant thing, but it says so much about the realism in the physics.

It wouldn't put the item into the invent, then I noticed if I had 1 item in the invent sometimes it would pick up an item. idk.. Also you can out of bounds insanely easy. Crouch jump height is OP. maybe it's just for the mod though. It was fun to jump on everything, it felt like I was climbing a COD4 map.\n\nGraphically beautiful, also the physics are incredible. shake up a soft drink bottle and watch the carbonation, does that really matter for gameplay? No, but it's cool to see a video game actually have that level of physics and laws that apply in game.\n\nStory was great.\n\nAs of right now I have to say this is my favourite half life game I've ever played.

This game FUCKS. \n\nCombat in this game is truely a highlight, as I found myself diving for cover and hiding while bullets whizzed over my head. the weapons compliment this, having unique upgrades and each serving their own purpose. I played this game on hard and let me tell you a couple of encounters really gave me a run for my money, but prevailing felt sooo soo good\n\nPuzzles are also a highlight. the multitool ones in particular are great. theres also an entire puzzle chapter which is super fun and I loved every second of it (chapt 7 for those who knows). Some cool physics puzzles which are a half life classic, and the russles made everything feel so good to interact with. \n\nSpeaking of russles, the gravity gun replacement in this game is downright ADDICTIVE.

I didn't agree with every creative decision that Valve took with this game, but overall I'm super happy to see Half Life return and I can't wait for newer games in the series.\nThe gameplay was amazing. All of it is incredibly fun and has Valve's characteristic high level of quality when it comes to level design, puzzles, enemy design. Having to actually manually reload guns and throw grenades adds a unique feel to the game that makes even headcrabs and zombies a legitimate challenge. The Combine especially are a much bigger challenge and have some of the most realistic behavior and tactics I've seen - they really feel like you're fighting actual soldiers. Jeff was a fantastic horror segment, truly a proud successor to Ravenholm. I just love the whole \"fungal zombies\" idea, so getting some of that in Half Life is just *chef's kiss.*\nThe story overall was great, it fit well into the HL storyline. As for the ending, [spoiler]at first I was a bit upset about Gman just changing the established timeline so Eli survives, I'm honestly not a fan of that trope. But honestly, the ending doesn't really show anything the Gman hasn't already been shown or implied to be capable of. [/spoiler]\nThe atmosphere and creative design is where I have a few issues. Everything seems a lot flashier and over-engineered than in previous Half Life games: examples like how the Manhacks glow, all the little bitty moving parts in the Combine charging stations, how a lot of characters have more over the top, exaggerated mannerisms, little stuff like that. Almost feels a bit more like Dishonored - it's not a bad aesthetic at all but I think in the future Valve should steer more towards the Half Life 2 monolithic aespects of the Combine. Not all of it is bad of course; at first I didn't like the new Combine designs but they've really grown on me. Also the humor, to be honest I think some of the humor was overdone, especially for a universe as dark as Half Life. Again, this is all nitpicking, the game still has tons of great charm and excellent little details that I truly appreciate. I think one thing that sort of threw me off was the Source 2 engine; I'm so used to Source 1 that the game almost looked not surreal enough for me lmao - this is just something I'll need to get used to, not a fault of the game at all, and the game is absolutely GORGEOUS, especially at dawn, this game is stunningly beautiful.\nThe soundtrack, to be honest, I was disappointed by. There were some great tracks, the track for the final Strider battle and the ending credits music were fantastic and fit perfectly. But other than that, the soundtrack was pretty generic, it seemed like something more out of Doom and Hollywood than Half Life 2's pretty distinctive sound.\nOverall, I give Half Life: Alyx an 80/100. I'm so, so happy that we got a new Half Life game after all these years, and I can't wait to see what the future of my favorite franchise holds. It's clear that regardless of some aspects of HLA I didn't really like, there's a ton of love and hard work in this game and I appreciate every bit of it. Hopefully a standard PC port comes soon so everybody gets a chance to play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1694374122, "timestamp_updated": 1694374122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

The combat, the enemies and the environments are all superb. Combat is not as fast as the two previous entries in the series but it makes up for that with much more tactical and methodical gameplay, where every shot matters and positioning is key. \n\nIt's not a perfect experience though, and all my issues come from the fact Valve were afraid not to scare any newcomers off of VR. We lack sprinting, instead of that we can teleport for faster movement, which surprisingly works well. The teleport ability also replaces jumping, but that does not work nearly as nicely as it did for sprinting. \n\nThe arsenal is also very limited as we have only 3 weapons this time. And again in fear of scaring off newcomers we don't have any two handed weapons and no melee combat. None of these issues are deal-breakers since the game is build around all this in mind. The ability to upgrade guns also goes a long way to make up for the limited arsenal.\nI do wish they updated the game to add more movement options now that the game has been out for a few years. \n\nThe only real problem with Half-Life Alyx is valve's insistence on not releasing a proper SDK for the game to allow modders to go wild. As we speak there are quite a few good mods and maps, but we won't be seeing a real explosion in modding until something is done about an SDK or better modding tools. \n\nAnyway in summary Half-Life Alyx may have issues, some in game and some out of it, but it is still unrivaled in the VR space, and absolute 10/10 experience and a must play spinoff/sequel to the Half-Life series.", "timestamp_created": 1693934971, "timestamp_updated": 1693934971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145710628": {"recommendationid": "145710628", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968339199", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 762, "last_played": 1693922570}, "language": "english", "review": "Best VR experience so far, just amazing.

"language": "english", "review": "i thought it was impossible, but i think i may have found a VR game to outshine saints and sinners\nhalf life alyx is a game that ive known of its existence for quite a while, but ive never really thought about playing it because ive never played any other half life games. but then one day i was looking for VR games to play on steam and i remembered i got alyx for free when i bought my valve index. so i thought \"eh, i'll give a try at least\"\nand i am so glad i did, because this game blew my expectations out of the water. its a really well made linear VR shooter where you traverse through the game, fighting a variety of enemies as you progress, as well as occasionally solving the odd puzzle. one of the things i like about the game was how theres a ton of things you can interact with throughout the game world. theres junk on shelves your can mess with, paintings on walls you can move around and take off the walls, knobs on sinks and tubs you can twist, ECT. sure none of these things are essential to the gameplay, but they really help with the immersion and makes it feel more like a real world. i wish more vr games did this. the game has a large variety of environments you encounter throughout your playthrough. from futuristic alien buildings, to dark dingy sewers, to overgrown abandoned houses, and more. the game has an impressive runtime, having the average casual playthrough being around 10-12 hours, which probably still isnt enough for me to consider it worth its price tag, but i got it for free so screw it.\nthe game also has these \"gravity gloves\" which are really intuitive from a VR standpoint. now most vr games can be a bit of a pain to have to bend over or crouch down to pick up everything, some games fix this by letting you \"force grab\" objects from a certain distance, but the gravity gloves not only solved this problem, they made it fun. you can latch onto any object from pretty much any distance, and flick your wrist to fling it right into your hand. this is done in a way that feels very natural, and enjoyable to do.\ncombat is pretty well done. theres a variety of enemies that you encounter, but they all require different tactics to fight. some enemies can be killed instantly if you shoot them in a very specific spot, some require to be shot in certain parts in a certain order to kill, and some you can feed explosives to for an explosive death. you have 3 weapons, a pistol, shotgun, and smg. theyre all very well balanced and you never feel like you overuse one, or one gets left out. youre also given grenades, health injectors, and explosive barrels you can shoot.\nthe story is pretty well done, even as someone who has never played half life before i could still understand the story perfectly fine. i think they wanted to make the game newcomer-friendly so even though they relied on pre-existing story beats from the previous games, but they still explained it for players who dont know or remember it. it had some colorful characters, both likeable and comedic, and the storyline has twists and turns that keeps you wanting to know what will happen next\noverall its a great game to play if you have a VR headset. if you got it with your valve index give it a try, but if not maybe wait for a sale if youre going to buy", "timestamp_created": 1693783258, "timestamp_updated":

For me, being weak at heart..HAHA....it's hair raising even to the point at times I have to take off the headset, tell myself it's only a game, put the headset back on and only find myself taking it off again!  The sound track is enough for me to pull off the headset.  HAHAHAHAHAA\n\nThis game is an adventure loaded with horror as well as \u201cbreak time\u201d where you can explore the area if you want.  Even after \u201ckilling\u201d your threat(s), there is time to explore and oh man, the DETAIL.  I found myself rearranging the boxes on shelves at times...HAAAAAA\n\nRunning your fingers over the screened windows and along the old cast iron heaters brings even more life and realisim to this game as there are details way beyond I could even imagine.  There were/are times where I forget where I am and actually wave the dust from the front of my face only to realized it's all VR.  HOLY COW! Talk about DETAIL!\n\nThe lighting is superbly done to where even in low lighted areas, you can see a light source which subtly illuminate surrounding objects even at the correct angles.  In the trains,  similar lighting is so realistic. \n\nOnly thing I found so far, is the writers/programmers could have made a similar lighting effect for Alyx.  She has no shadow whatsoever.\n\nI finally found this as I wondered around in the plaza to the Northern Star.  The \"sun\" was casting shadows all over the place, so Alyx turns around, looks down, and \"NO SHADOW\".    Not a deal breaker by all means, but it would have added an extra layer of realism.  \n\nEven Friends were amazed at the relistice and detailed graphics within the game.  During my \u201cdowntime\u201d within a segment, inside or out, I would take them on a \u201ctour\u201d of that portion on the game.  I had to hold their hands while the spun around...Hahaha\n\nOverall, if you like this kind of game...THIS is the game.  (like I should know what other games do...hahaha).  I found the comments about the game to be true and spot on.  Even though I have nothing to compare this game to, I would comfortably say, this is the BEST so far. \n\n\nThis game was already 3 years old at the time I started playing it, I would only imagine VR will be the way to go for certain things of course.  Can't wait to finish this one and start it all over as well as delve into other titles and genres.  \n\nThanks for reading.\nCheers.\nD", "timestamp_created": 1693744162, "timestamp_updated": 1693744162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145576842": {"recommendationid": "145576842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198955004694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1041, "last_played": 1693201233}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a certified sustenance classic", "timestamp_created": 1693727699, "timestamp_updated": 1693727699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145573466": {"recommendationid": "145573466", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996942440", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 762, "last_played": 1694665590}, "language": "english", "review": "*this* is Half-Life 3", "timestamp_created": 1693722421, "timestamp_updated": 1693722421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145567124": {"recommendationid": "145567124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086102749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 261, "last_played": 1693807631}, "language": "english", "review": "ghv", "timestamp_created": 1693712530, "timestamp_updated": 1693712530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145563359": {"recommendationid": "145563359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797058495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3550, "last_played": 1698110694}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Creo que pasar\u00e1n muchos a\u00f1os antes de que se vuelva a publicar otro juego de realidad virtual de la calidad de Half Life Alix.", "timestamp_created": 1693707109, "timestamp_updated": 1693707109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145562188": {"recommendationid": "145562188", "author": {"steamid": "76561199380912108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 796, "last_played": 1693107482}, "language": "english", "review": "very imersive, great game", "timestamp_created": 1693705344, "timestamp_updated": 1693705344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145549756": {"recommendationid": "145549756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367946947", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1154, "last_played": 1654750166}, "language": "english", "review": "(REVIEW IS SPOILER-FREE!)\n\n[u]FIRST OF ALL: ACCESSIBILITY![/u]\n(because i dont see a lot of steam reviews mention it, on any game.)\n\n[list]\n[*]game difficulty can be adjusted, whether you want to play easy due to accessibility, or if you still want a bit of a challenge even if youre bad at games! \n[*]captions work great, along with great voice acting that's clear and audible. \n[*]lots of movement required. this is either an upside or downside, depending on how your body is about gettin some exercise. personally made me very achy, very fast, but thats due to my specific chronic pain issues so take it with a grain of salt\n[*]big modding community so if you need somethin you can probably find a mod for it somewhere. \n[*]easy-to-learn controls, but may cause issues for those with motor skills/hand-eye coordination problems. still generally do-able though! \n[*]THE GAME CAN BE LOUD!! because theres guns explosions etc. but overall more accessible audio-wise than any other half-life game! (and most first person shooters in general, tbh)\n[*]contains various common emotional and sensory triggers (blood/gore, body horror, aliens, loud audio and sudden noises, along with flashing) while none of this is new for the half-life franchise, i think its especially important to mention due to it being a VR title. stay safe, and err on the side of caution if any of this may cause you serious medical issues!\n[/list]\n\n^ ive also allowed comments on this review if anyone has other accessibility questions! comments unrelated to accessibility will be ignored, sorry!\n\n[u]OVERALL REVIEW[/u]\n\nquite literally the most beautiful game i've ever played. in so many ways.\n\nin the time that it took me to finish the game over years (due to inconsistent access to vr hardware) it was always so easy to get back into it after being away for a long time. after becoming unable to properly play in the way i used to, i did NOT let that stop me from seeing the absolute gorgeous entry via watching a playthrough on youtube. while it's possible to play without vr with mods, or just watch it online, i guarantee you that they DID go to the absolute fullest when selecting virtual reality as a medium. its genuinely the best vr experience, maybe even game as a whole, known to humanity. without exaggeration. and while its enjoyable in any format you consume it in, i highly encourage use of VR equipment to play this yourself.\n\nafter seeing the ending, i woke up the next day back to being obsessed with half life like i was years ago. and now im dead set on adjusting my setup to allow me to play with vr controllers even with my disability and limited hardware from my bed. im not kidding when i say that this game is so beautiful that im finding workarounds for getting it to work on a gaming laptop with outdated hardware just so i can play it again with my disability. \n\nlevel design is intuitive, clear, and gorgeous. graphics are gorgeous. overall visual design is gorgeous. game ran great for me, with little to no framerate dropping. lots of fun with both central game mechanics AND story. heart wrenching writing that made me want to throw up from getting emotional about it. easy-to-learn gameplay that never takes long to pick up, no matter how long youve been gone.\n\nmy criticisms: jeff scared me. but seriously, the only thing i have is more of a warning that applies to vr in general. take breaks!! 1-2 hour gameplay sessions with 15 min breaks worked best for me. any longer than that and i ended up achy, nauseous, and disoriented due to the heavy action and movement present within the semi-frequent combat areas. \n\n10/10 game, worth every penny.", "timestamp_created": 1693688338, "timestamp_updated": 1693688338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132270812988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145548821": {"recommendationid": "145548821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982219586", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1698473516}, "language": "english", "review": "terrible pc but good game", "timestamp_created": 1693687380, "timestamp_updated": 1693687380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145546378": {"recommendationid": "145546378", "author": {"steamid": "76561199173392808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 877, "last_played": 1698516210}, "language": "english", "review": "gait game buy", "timestamp_created": 1693684910, "timestamp_updated": 1693684910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145542139": {"recommendationid": "145542139", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122629911", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1696698817}, "language": "english", "review": "great glass bottles", "timestamp_created": 1693680215, "timestamp_updated": 1693680215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145530722": {"recommendationid": "145530722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273433715", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1690704076}, "language": "english", "review": "Bugged completely half way through (Think chapter 6)", "timestamp_created": 1693668482, "timestamp_updated": 1693668482, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480937004089355469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145523595": {"recommendationid": "145523595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111188319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1847, "last_played": 1689447598}, "language": "english", "review": "It's still the best VR Game/Experience to me. \nIt works fluid using Virtual desktop + Oculus Quest 2, after some tweaking.\nIt maybe too short.

Valve has done the impossible by delivering an experience that not only lives up to the storied legacy of the Half-Life series but also sets an unprecedented standard for VR gaming as a whole. From the moment I put on the headset, I was transported into a world that felt so real, so engaging, and so utterly captivating that it's hard to put into words.\n\nThe attention to detail in Half-Life: Alyx is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Every corner of the game world is meticulously crafted, immersing you in a post-apocalyptic City 17 that oozes atmosphere and authenticity. The visual fidelity is breathtaking, with lifelike textures, intricate environmental design, and lighting effects that make you forget you're in a virtual space. Valve's Source 2 engine is a true marvel, and it's clear that the developers have pushed it to its limits to create an experience that pushes the boundaries of what VR can achieve.\n\nGameplay-wise, Half-Life: Alyx raises the bar for VR interactions. The game brilliantly leverages the immersive capabilities of virtual reality to make every action feel natural and intuitive. Picking up objects, solving puzzles, reloading weapons \u2013 it all feels incredibly satisfying. The physics-based interactions make the world feel tangible, and the level of interactivity is unmatched. Even after hours of gameplay, I found myself constantly amazed by the sheer depth of the mechanics and how well they integrate into the narrative.\n\nSpeaking of the narrative, Half-Life: Alyx delivers a gripping story that fills in the gaps between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Players assume the role of Alyx Vance, a beloved character in the series, as she fights against the oppressive Combine forces. The writing is top-notch, filled with the kind of storytelling and character development that the Half-Life series is known for. The pacing is impeccable, seamlessly blending action-packed moments with quieter, more atmospheric segments that allow you to soak in the world around you.\n\nOne of the standout features of Half-Life: Alyx is its innovative use of VR to create tension and immersion in ways that traditional gaming cannot. The suspense of creeping through dark corridors, the rush of frantically defending yourself against enemies, and the heart-pounding encounters with terrifying creatures \u2013 all of these are heightened by the VR medium. The game's sound design and spatial audio play a crucial role in this, allowing you to hear enemies approaching from all directions and creating an uncanny sense of presence.\n\nValve has also shown a commitment to accessibility with Half-Life: Alyx. They've included a variety of comfort options that cater to players with different levels of VR experience, ensuring that everyone can enjoy the game without feeling overwhelmed or nauseous.\n\nIn conclusion, Half-Life: Alyx is a monumental achievement in gaming, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in virtual reality. Valve has not only delivered a worthy addition to the Half-Life series but has also set a new gold standard for VR game development. If you own a VR headset, playing Half-Life: Alyx is an absolute must. It's an experience that will stay with you long after you've put down the headset \u2013 a testament to the power of immersive storytelling and groundbreaking gameplay.\n\nPros:\n\nStunning visual fidelity and attention to detail\nInnovative and intuitive VR interactions\nGripping narrative that expands the Half-Life universe\nTense and immersive gameplay unique to the VR medium\nThoughtful accessibility options for all players\nCons:\n\nRequires a VR headset, limiting accessibility for some gamers\nVerdict: Half-Life: Alyx is a true masterpiece that sets a new standard for virtual reality gaming. Valve has outdone themselves, creating an experience that's not only a must-play for Half-Life fans but a showcase of the incredible potential of VR as a storytelling and gameplay medium.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1693256030, "timestamp_updated": 1693256030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145209328": {"recommendationid": "145209328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334724030", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1691833670}, "language": "english", "review": "Still the flagship VR title.\n\nThis is a full on uncompromised Half-Life experience, the game is very well thought out and keeps finding new interesting scenarios for the player to play through. \n\nIf you own a VR headset and a PC capable of running this game, getting this is a no-brainer.", "timestamp_created": 1693242217, "timestamp_updated": 1693242217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773059189319610596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145176851": {"recommendationid": "145176851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208080981", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1693350370}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game", "timestamp_created": 1693195834, "timestamp_updated": 1693195834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145169861": {"recommendationid": "145169861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309756603", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 934, "last_played": 1693184271}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bastante guapo el juego, la historia si eres como y oque ni idea de half life es un poco meh, pero la jugabilidad es >>>>>>", "timestamp_created": 1693184520, "timestamp_updated": 1693184520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145169526": {"recommendationid": "145169526", "author": {"steamid": "76561199526429478", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2181, "last_played": 1699404556}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely gorgeous game.

The details, not only in textures, models, but also the maps themselves, are a joy to behold.\n\nThe game guides you very nicely through the entire story. And yes, it is very very linear.

Usually I try to wait until I complete the initial stories of singleplayer games but I have rare exceptions. This game is amazing. \n\nThe physics are next level in this game, nearly every object can be interacted with, objects have collision with your guns and such. It's so immersive. It's horror fairly horrific in some sections which take place in dark places where you need to use external lightsources to see. The gunplay is fun but not over the top. It's very basic, you just aim, shoot, press a button to remove mag and load the clip it, then slide the slide back to chamber a round.

It is clear that the developers went all out on this game. The story, the mechanics, the environment, the interactions, puzzles and hidden secrets make the game feel very alive.\n\nI would consider the game more an adventure rather than a FPS. The game houses 3 different guns you can upgrade as the play the story. Unfortunatly the game has no melee wepons for you to use. Besides weapons and grenades you are equiped with a set of Gravity-Gloves, a special set of gloves that allows you to pull in items from around you. While the gloves are not as obviously usefull like a gun, they can be used in a lot of creative ways to help you, both in and out of combat.\n\nThe movent the game offers are both locomotion and teleport. Crouching is done by, well, crouching. Jumping is however, not part of the game. \n\nThe story takes place in a city you won't travel far in. Map wise is seems like a short walk but the levels are plentyfull. On the streets,  though the building, metrostations and even further underground you will face many different environments on a play-through. The story is intense and well-paced. Everywhere you find silly humors and funny achievment challenges. \n\nHalf-Life: Alyx is a must play for those who have a VR set.

The sound design further enhances the immersion, with every creak and whisper adding to the suspenseful atmosphere.\n\nValve has truly outdone themselves with Half-Life: Alyx. It's a game that demands to be experienced by any VR enthusiast and a must-play for Half-Life fans. This is not just a game; it's a landmark achievement that sets a new standard for VR gaming.

There's only a few problems I have but they're pretty big in my opinion. First, there's no run button or running of any kind. WTF!? This is a game that really requires it; a game where you're constantly running (walking?) away from horrible creatures. A huge fu ckup. Not sure what the pathetic excuse was because it wasn't because it wasn't possible. Second, they put a flashlight on one hand and the gun on the other with no option of putting the light on the same hand as the gun or as an attachment to the gun itself, whatever so long as the light points to where I'm aiming. Again, WTF!? This was another huge blunder that has so far ruined the game for every place that requires a light. The light is a piece of crap too. One of those I'll point a narrow bright beam that leaves it completely dark outside the tiny diameter beam so I'm constantly pointing it frantically all over the place and when you move it the graphics are so awesome that the shadows in the light are annoying, constantly bouncing around with the frenetic searching. PUT THE LIGHT ON THE GUN!!! Idiots, seriously, how can they spend so much time and effort to create something so grand and to ruin it with stupid choices that make no sense. To completely eliminate basic controls and logical, possible options. Then there are the standard VR complaints that go with whatever system you have. I have a Rift and I can't alter the height of the ground, so my VR ground is always a foot or so below the real ground. Lucky Rift S and Quest owners have a simple option in the settings. Us that bought early and supported them first have been ignored and sh it on by oculus and meta for not buying a newer system. So I can't touch or open anything that's below my floor.

just like HL2 in terms of gameplay. with some teleporting in some instances and auto climbing of ladders.\n\nso to anyone thinking about shelling out on cheap garbage VR headsets like oculus from META

I hadn't seen this since SiN Episodes: Emergence!\nSome Combine Soldiers have weapons that cannot be picked up (probably because they are two-handed).\n\n- Script\nThe story is too vague and has little connection to the rest of the series.\nIt really seems like the devs only had a vague knowledge of the lore.\nVery few elements of HL2 Beta are recycled when there really is plenty to do.\nThe paranormal / gore side is way too exacerbated...\nWhere is Dog? He is supposed to protect Alyx since her childhood...\nWhere is Breen? Where is all the propaganda?\n\n- Bestiary\nIf the bestiary is quite varied, but how to legitimize its disappearance before the events of Half-Life 2?\nWe had the same problem with the Race-X in Opposing Force long before...\nThe new enemies are not fun to fight for several reasons.\nThe Armored Headcrab is armored on top and only its ventral part is vulnerable.\nThe different Combine Heavy Soldiers are very resistant and their weapons hurt too much, even from afar. Like I said, we can't take their guns. They are similar to the Heavy Replicas from F.E.A.R. ...\nThe Antlion Soldiers are armored, they have to be dismembered so that you can shoot into their abdomen, causing them to explode!\nDitto for the Antlion Workers, except they spit a painful blue acid that coats the screen...\nThe worst of the worst from Half-Life Alyx's bestiary:\nThe Lightning Dog (Reviver): A kind of electric Headcrab that, in addition to electrocuting you and being resistant, can take control of corpses like the Remnant from F.E.A.R. 2 and land powerful attacks.\n\"Jeff\": A unique, blind, but not deaf zombie. I have no words, how to say... Why does such an abomination exist in the Half-Life universe? Who could validate this stuff?\n\n- Scenery\nIf the city, on the surface is pleasant, it is not the same for the undergrounds, moreover too numerous. You will become claustrophobic.\nThe interiors are massively covered with a kind of biomass, dirty as possible, sometimes explosive. There too, we are closer to F.E.A.R. 2 for example.\nThe last chapter is closer to Portal 2. What is the visual affiliation with Half-Life 2?\n\n- Dubbing\nThe game is only dubbed in English! Seriously! After dubbing the old Half-Life games in loads of languages!\nHowever, it is subtitled in a few languages, even if it's easy to understand in the original version.\n\n- Bugs:\nI found myself several times and easily outside the map not knowing where to go...\nWe regularly find ourselves blocked everywhere for no reason.\nSometimes I can't grab ammo because it's stuck in the floor.\n\n- Conclusion\nHalf-Life Alyx is for me a HUGE disappointment, as Half-Life games are legendary.\nThe ending of the game clearly calls for a sequel to HL2 Episode Two.\nThe game being what it is, Half-Life 3 could be ruined.\nBetter for Valve not to make it, and let's keep its legendary aura.\nIn the meantime, I'm going back to Half-Life 2 Beta.", "timestamp_created": 1690755031, "timestamp_updated": 1691014538, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544689178466796875", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143110452": {"recommendationid": "143110452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342454144", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 3390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 139, "playtime_at_review": 1413, "last_played": 1700591461}, "language": "english", "review": "The half life of VR", "timestamp_created": 1690753787, "timestamp_updated": 1690753787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143110365": {"recommendationid": "143110365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096093495", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1352, "last_played": 1690662294}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best vr games i have played yet, this is a must play to any vr user especially fans of the half life series.", "timestamp_created": 1690753664, "timestamp_updated": 1690753664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143110096": {"recommendationid": "143110096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967976004", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 851, "last_played": 1690825264}, "language": "english", "review": "Has one of the best endings in the gaming industry.", "timestamp_created": 1690753318, "timestamp_updated": 1690753318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513513505458831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143107996": {"recommendationid": "143107996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121797462", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 1867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1713, "last_played": 1692461530}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is a technological achievement that showcases incredibly immersive VR interaction, as well as highly detailed environments with many interactive objects, despite the high performance goal.\n\nThe story occurs between the events of Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2, within City 17. This time, you're Alyx (didn't see that coming), in a journey through Xen-infested, Combine-controlled environments, saving your father and getting to the super-weapon concealed in The Vault. The campaign is about 15 hours long, and can be extended with mods from the Workshop.\n\nMany elements from previous Half-Life games return in this entry, to the point that some parts of the game try to exactly replicate environments from previous entries. Gnome Chompski is one such feature, but at least this time he's much easier to transport.\n\nThe combat is enjoyable and tense in some spots, and there are new and returning enemies to find, as well as many (honestly, filler) holographic puzzles, however, the story and immersive presentation are the real kicker. The audio design is also dramatically improved, and despite most returning character voice actors being new, they did a perfect job.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nJust to address a few technical things:\n\nThe NoVR mod is not worth the time, not unless the game is played in VR first. It would ruin the first experience for such a massive title where the core idea is that it's a VR game, where interactions aren't dumbed down to pressing a button, your accuracy is determined by the ability to aim with your own hands, and it is paced such that the player is expected to take a look around instead of running through levels.\n\nThe Linux version works reasonably well*, however, during my time playing the game, I always kept getting permanent lag during the session after some time.

"language": "english", "review": "for a game that is deliberately telling people that its not half life 3, and is therefore not going to be as groundbreaking has half life 3 would be, it still features great game design and use of vr's capabilities with features that wouldnt be possible in a 1st person shooter. such small and intricate spaces meant to be explored up close instead of vast open areas, seamless interaction with objects and puzzles (although they do get stale by the late game) that feels natural because of the way the hands can be controlled, and cover based shooter combat that is actually fun without being as overwhelming as an actual war.\n\nthe gravity gloves are a really good choice for the most important specific action the player preforms in the game because the average office or bedroom is of course not as large as the in game environments, so the gloves allow the player to interact with distant objects and pick things up without it being as tedious as in real life and breaking the pacing. additionally they perfectly fit into the half life universe thematically.\n\nand even while making a soup of good game mechanics the devs didnt forget that the purpose of vr is immersion. so even though my janky computer cant handle the graphics without lagging out my quest 2 every 20 minutes i was still immersed in the beautiful environments because i find alien flesh growths beautiful. even if the game had no story and was just called explore abandoned buildings simulator ft. a hundred headcrabs i would still give it a good rating.\n\nand that is because the story isnt the focus. its pretty simple and easy to follow on its own but in the context of having played half life 2 is probably a genius retcon type situation that solves the cliffhanger of episode 2 and creates a new one for the story of a new game to use. that being said i havent played half life 2 yet and i dont fully know how im meant to interpret the story even after watching an explanation video so i can write this review accurately.\n\nthe game doesnt have any outstanding drawbacks reducing its quality and the largest issue for me was the small amount of content and little replayability, but both of these issues can be fixed with mods which the game openly supports in the form of custom maps and addons.\n\nso while i dont recommend spending $400 or so just to play this game (or any individual game), it is a must have for anybody that already has access to vr.\n\n4/6\n(leaning alot towards 5 though)", "timestamp_created": 1690252345,

Just make a new Valve lightgun, which will be accessible to many people because it's a very simple (cheap to produce) device, and revive the genre of lightgun shooters.", "timestamp_created": 1689967749, "timestamp_updated": 1690966321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418883055448532104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142539136": {"recommendationid": "142539136", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972287021", "num_games_owned": 1067, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1603322255}, "language": "english", "review": "This review is 3+ years late but I was thinking about this game again and I needed to jot my thoughts down.\n\nI got a VR headset, a 1st gen Vive, originally for trying out this new, unexplored territory of virtual reality gaming and what it could offer. I played a few games, all of which were really good in their own right but had their flaws... then I played Alyx. \n\nAlyx absolutely [i]ruined[/i] ruined VR games for me. Not because it's bad, but because it's so unbelievably f--king amazing. Alyx makes you feel totally connected to its environment through pretty much very small detail; how guns work, how characters in person interact with you, how you as the player interact with the environment through random things you can touch, puzzles, and how you have to actually throw stuff around off shelves and scavenge for supplies, how you have to traverse the world, and so much more. When you're behind a pillar taking pot shots at a large amount of combine, or trying to find ways to slow down zombies to buy yourself time to reload or scavenge, it really feels.like you're there doing these things. The world feels real which makes it all the more wild when the world starts breaking the rules of reality.\n\nI don't want to spoil too much but, essentially, this game takes full advantage of its medium to deliver single handedly the best VR experience pretty much ever. And it's completely spoiled me. No other VR game comes close to being as engaging as Alyx does; not even 3+ years later. And it makes all the older VR games not fun to play because you just want to recapture that same feeling of awe, wonder, and engagement that Alyx provides.\n\nYou need to play it. You just have to.

A smile creeps across your face as the Combine death sound plays, a life-sized Vortigaunt talks to you, and a [redacted] or a [redacted] or [REDACTED] is in your face. The immersion is so far above anything else and the storytelling and pace is classic Valve. I don't know why they're so frightened of public response to HL3 because Alyx proves they haven't lost a step.\n\nIt is nearly correct to say \"do not buy VR without buying Alyx\". You need it.

There is no storytelling about Alyx or her past, no storytelling about her family, no new storytelling about anything, just a tiny cliffhanger that is new at the end of the game. I have the feeling that Valve is so scared of the Half-Life franchise (fear of doing anything wrong), that they don't want to risk a bad new game (HL3) or risk something in the story that would create new problems.

Hopefully they follow up on this with another VR half-life game, because this was one of my favorite gaming experiences ever, and I want to see more games in this style, as well as the continuation to the story. \nThere is one piece of criticism I want to give this game: It's a bit too easy. It throws healing items at you left and right, and it's almost impossible to run out of ammo if you pay attention to your surroundings. But it's understandable, given the experimental nature of the game, I'm sure they wanted to play it safe before going balls to the walls with the difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1689005869, "timestamp_updated": 1689245242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141767701": {"recommendationid": "141767701", "author": {"steamid": "76561199511692470", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1700099712}, "language": "english", "review": "non mechanical reproduction simulator with a persons of my choice???? who wouldnt pass that option up", "timestamp_created": 1689004654, "timestamp_updated": 1689004654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141766361": {"recommendationid": "141766361", "author": {"steamid": "76561199196201734", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1689198013}, "language": "english", "review": "good game but i hate headcrabs i had a heart attack\n 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1689003406, "timestamp_updated": 1689003406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141762395": {"recommendationid": "141762395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111017139", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7848, "last_played": 1689243108}, "language": "english", "review": "don't have a VR headset but I play source 2 workshop tools, very fun.", "timestamp_created": 1688999627, "timestamp_updated": 1688999627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141760972": {"recommendationid": "141760972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278964714", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1360, "last_played": 1689440639}, "language": "english", "review": "Best VR game I've ever played. 10/10, recommend to anyone", "timestamp_created": 1688998239, "timestamp_updated": 1688998239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141752331": {"recommendationid": "141752331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198993884750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1679158939}, "language": "english", "review": "dogballs", "timestamp_created": 1688988977, "timestamp_updated": 1688988977, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.36771729588508606", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141744409": {"recommendationid": "141744409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056269352", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94, "playtime_at_review": 806, "last_played": 1700790710}, "language": "english", "review": "9.5/10\n\nIf you have a Vr Headset, this game is a must have.

Unlike most other valve games you only have a arsenal of 3 weapons including a multitool, and while this may sound bad the resin upgrade machine really adds some more kick into your guns. \n\nIf I had to give the most honest review I would definitely send this game a 10/10.\nOr in other words BUY IT!", "timestamp_created": 1688867440, "timestamp_updated": 1688867440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141643742": {"recommendationid": "141643742", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027816063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1688854713}, "language": "english", "review": "cant seggs the old guy", "timestamp_created": 1688865966, "timestamp_updated": 1688865966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141641939": {"recommendationid": "141641939", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228870797", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1689116946}, "language": "english", "review": "gordon is so hot", "timestamp_created": 1688863582, "timestamp_updated": 1689643857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141641078": {"recommendationid": "141641078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180375341", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 456, "last_played": 1688040314}, "language": "english", "review": "Really immersive and love the interaction with environment.

this day, in 2023. Across all VR platforms and the PC that exist as of right now, Valve managed to not only release a new installment 13 years after the last Half-Life title with a twist that re-wrote the end of Half-Life 2 Episode 2, but also combine everything I constantly miss about VR games - fluid gameplay in all actions with polished technical elements, all into one package.\n\nI'm particularly fond of the Gravity Gloves, which are super quick to learn and super easy to use. It's not on a level like Half-Life 2's sandbox gameplay with it's Gravitron, but still allows for cool moves in the world. Sometimes foregrounded physical objects that you accidentally pull towards you can be the reason you get frustrated when using them, but those moments are pretty rare.\nAnd speaking of physical objects: Every object in the world can be interacted with as you would expect in real life: Understandable, with weight, sometimes requiring two-handed actions. I found myself very often just playing around with rattling a box of matches near my ear to hear them moving in the box or just throwing and jiggling cardboard boxes around. It's a lot of fun.\n\nThe weapons serve their purpose in the world, although I would have liked to see a rudimentary melee weapon to knock down wooden slats or headcrabs, even though i can sort of understand why it is missing in the world because it can make inventory management a whole lot easier, taking away the situation Alyx is in. But a pipe you can smack something like 3 times with would've been cool nonetheless. What i dislike about the weapon selection is the pistol, which like in many VR games, takes the design of the 1911. We've had enough games that use this as a standard. Other than that, the game shifts the focus from the pistol being the main weapon to the SMG in the second half of the game with the shotgun being the weapon which is the most coolest out of them, but also the one barely used because of how few shotgun shells you find for it.\nThe multi-tool is cool and is also well incorporated into the game world.\n\nThe story is well-written and i liked to experience it while playing, although the connection to Half-Life 2 Episode 2 in this game makes me want to see another game in the franchise again. Normally, when people beg Valve for another Half-Life game, i often roll the eyes, but now Valve brought it up to themselves with the ending. Characters in the world are also very well designed, have amazing voice actors and body motion within the world, with the exception of Alyx' voice. Russell is normally a character i'd despise of in real life, but through the conversations i had with him, i started to like him more and more. The conversations with Eli are often only \"I miss you baby\" and \"I can't believe it\". A little bit uncanny is the Vortigaunt's mouth when speaking, since i was so used to the design in Half-Life 2.\n\nThe game world is very well designed and fun to move around in, with the only thing in it that i can't understand being the existence and placement of resin balls which are used for weapon upgrades, or the fact that there is always ammunition scattered around and on some people and ONLY the ones YOU need, which makes the feel of the world a little bit out of place. SMG rounds being found somewhere is fine, since it's a weapon actually used by someone else than you, but finding shotgun shells and pistol magazines when seemingly no one else has a weapon like it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n\nBut even with little logical mistakes or irritating design choices - at least in my eyes - the game is a must-have for everyone who owns a capable PC and a VR headset. The community-made campaigns, especially Levitation, are also incredibly well-made, making them the big cherry on top of your dessert. And especially in a sale for about 24 euros, which is a bit more than Blade & Sorcery or Pavlov VR outside a sale, it's totally worth it. You can also use the NoVR mod if you don't own a VR headset, in that case tho except a lot less of the impressions that VR players normally have with Half-Life Alyx.", "timestamp_created": 1688772748,

For the 2 hours i have on record its literally been walking listening to dialogue shooting a headcrab or two then continuing onto some stupid puzzle. It would have been a good game has they made any of the thousands of items you can pickup actually do something. whats the point in having metal bars when you cant hit anything with them. whats the point in having limited ammo when you cant do anything at all without it. the only time i died was when i didnt have bullets in a pistol and a head crab slow walked towards me and then latched on and slowly killed me. it was extremely dissapointing and anti climactic. i thought for sure i could at least trap it in a bucket but nah you can even do that. might as well not touch anything in the environment and just spam the stupid teleport movement to the end of the level. this game feels so worthless honestly its like if you took all the actual interaction from a vr game and replaced it with stuff to hold >.> ion wanna hold it if its worthless. you can crush a can oooo. but find a bottle filled with liquid. you cant open the bottle. you cant hurt anyone with the bottle. but you can smash it onto the floor with your hands. its such a pointless game it doesnt feel like a full half life game it feels like a glorified tech demo that just shows off that its *possible* to have good graphics in vr. everything else is just a let down. hell even bodies are lame. you can pull a body a total of 2 inches before it literally just anchors onto the ground from a random point causing you to drop it. say you do manage to get it over to the ceiling things that grab you. it will literally refuse to even interact with the corpse. half life 2 vr literally does everything this does but better and i guess uglier. avoid this game unless its on sale fr fr. even 20 feels like a steep price though.", "timestamp_created": 1688670726, "timestamp_updated": 1688670726, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407584547996520996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141469001": {"recommendationid": "141469001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409466082", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 463, "last_played": 1697412262}, "language": "english", "review": "this game made me spent $300 in Oculus rift S for the Oculus quest 2 be in offer 2 days later, 10/10 best game by valve and best vr game", "timestamp_created": 1688669101, "timestamp_updated": 1688669101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141464045": {"recommendationid": "141464045", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961166916", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1216, "last_played": 1689441126}, "language": "english", "review": "very good graphics and also scary if you are in dark areas (BTW when Russel gives you a gun go to the couch in the corner of the building he is looking out of to find a familiar gnome if you have played half life 2", "timestamp_created": 1688664872, "timestamp_updated": 1688664872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141463769": {"recommendationid": "141463769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035237751", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 735, "last_played": 1688675150}, "language": "english", "review": "great vr game", "timestamp_created": 1688664622, "timestamp_updated": 1688664622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141463349": {"recommendationid": "141463349", "author": {"steamid": "76561199107329877", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1688663454}, "language": "english", "review": "Not for no-lives.
