(Achievement progression that doesnt even exist in Original version..)\n*New Lore from mystery company called metaverse (the Build-in OS that you used in game menu) due to spoiler i cant said much..)\n*Just Monika UwU\n\nCON:\n*Other than ease of use, side story and virtual upgrade, Its still same game as original.. might not worth buying for some,..\n*Some Secret (Spoiler) not achieveable in Plus version\n*Early Chapter of Side Story is bit generic and mid for me. imo..\n*Some Hardcore player might find the immersion is ruined by some new thing (such as build-in OS) which ruin the orignal charm..\n*Some achievement might be pain to get..(Spoiler)\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIts kinda like definite edition of the game compare to original expect you have to pay for it (imo, its worth every single penny~!) , I gonna said, the first impression is okay and the horror element is very Effective and amazing, Cant tell exactly cause spoiler, you know... the side story is addition that excluded from the original, IMO, is okay at beginning but getting good and at the end, especially character development, its unexpected good, and also new added lore over original is cool like the company that make the virtual OS at main menu, Overall its a great game, and the dev behind it is amazing with the story and design this game, conclusion?

I think this game is the best kind of follow-up to DDLC that Dan and his team could have made.  Although I wish there was more content surrounding the club members in more side stories or a new post-game ending, it definitely helped to scratch that itch I was looking for in terms of world-building and character development.

The music tab is great for music lovers, and if you prefer one song over another, you can choose to loop one specific song or a playlist while playing!

Of course, like every other game on the planet, it has issues. It's best to get those out of the way first. I'll be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Sayori's sprite(I dunno if I used that right) since it looks really out of place. Luckily, she looks pretty good in most cutscenes like the ones in the side stories. Secondly, the game can be really long, especially if you want to try to get 100% perfection (which I'm still working on).

Also, just in case anyone has reached here and is looking into getting the game, IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH BLOOD, SUICIDE, OR ANYTHING SIMILAR, BE WARNED.

It has an amazing story with perfectly crafted characters. They all have their own personalities, motives, pasts and dreams and they are all available for you to figure out and discover. The gameplay follows the usual Dating-Sim type formular with a few twists here and there. For example, at the End of every in-game day, you as the player write a poem (chose a few words from a list) and present it to the literature club. Depending on which words you used the most when writing the poem, the character that likes it the most will spend some more time with you on that day. For 100% completion you will have to do a lot of replaying and reloading but the game has an auto dialog skip that stops every time something new happens or you have to make a choice. But before we talk about completion we have to start at the beginning.\n\nYour Story begins on a regular school morning, where you meet your old friend Sayori. She has been on the lookout for a new member in the literature club and begs you to join her. Given the circumstances of being a loser, you have no other real options and decide to go with her to your first day in the club.\nAnd from that point, your life as a member of the literature club has begun, but don\u2019t get to comfortable, things may not be how they are presented to you. One character especially has their eyes on you, but I won\u2019t spoil it here, even if everyone and their mother probably knows who I am referring to. \n\nIf you only care about the horror aspect of the game and want something to play for Halloween, DDLC has a free version on steam too. The paid version is much more user-friendly and has some side content like Soundtrack list, Sidestories etc. so Its definitely worth your money if you feel invested in the story and characters.\nDoki

For the love of God and your own sake, please, buy the Plus! version of DDLC. I absolutely love how feelings and emotions are addressed in this game, and imo, it's one of its majestic points.

Heck, there is so far the story can go that there is an achievement for getting %100 of everything, and not even %10 of players have achieved that, yet I plan to be one of those players", "timestamp_created": 1696808776, "timestamp_updated": 1696808776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147862376": {"recommendationid": "147862376", "author": {"steamid": "76561199262777526", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1656029594}, "language": "english", "review": "used to hate monika until I realized I just relate to her", "timestamp_created": 1696766905, "timestamp_updated": 1696766905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661240041255950928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147845103": {"recommendationid": "147845103", "author": {"steamid": "76561199118856355", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 197, "playtime_at_review": 884, "last_played": 1699936940}, "language": "english", "review": "If anyone knows where I can find myself a Yuri lmk", "timestamp_created": 1696740028, "timestamp_updated": 1696740028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147837977": {"recommendationid": "147837977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108776305", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 4103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3182, "last_played": 1698128450}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si", "timestamp_created": 1696727855, "timestamp_updated": 1696727855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147836675": {"recommendationid": "147836675", "author": {"steamid": "76561199417236448", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1447, "last_played": 1696725098}, "language": "english", "review": "Monkeys can climb\nCrickets can leap\nHorses can race\nOwls can seek\nCheetahs can run\nEagles can fly\nPeople can try\nBut that's about it.", "timestamp_created": 1696725612, "timestamp_updated": 1696725612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510638296604156494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147832333": {"recommendationid": "147832333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115241375", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 6771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6771, "last_played": 1630602926}, "language": "english", "review": "too many anime eyes, 0/10", "timestamp_created": 1696718821, "timestamp_updated": 1696718821, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147825541": {"recommendationid": "147825541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304087880", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1696901063}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not crazy, man.

trabajo artistico, la musica de este juego es muy buena y envolvente, te da tranquilidad, felicidad o algo de tension en los momentos en que todo se descontrola.\npero mas que nada, lo que mas destaca es la historia y la forma en el que se maneja, el miedo que puede generar en momentos, pero la profundidad y la ense\u00f1anza que deja respecto a todo lo que envuelve a la poesia y la literatura (mas que nada en las historias paralelas, que hacen que valga la pena comprar el plus)\nademas de que el ddlc plus trae todo el apartado de imagenes desbloqueables, que si te lo queres platinar te va a

1802, "last_played": 1692553770}, "language": "english", "review": "The review below will not contain any story-related spoilers for the game! It is directed to veterans of the original that consider to buy this new version of the game as well as to newcomers who are interested in playing for the first time.\n\nI do encourage everyone to treat the disclaimers of Doki Doki Literature Club and its Plus version seriously. It's a game that, when effective, can absolutely be torturous to handle, especially when you're suffering from mental problems or are on the more emotional side of folks. The game has a disclaimer function that does warn you of such contents and also features a list at the beginning, should you want to prepare.\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club Plus is not only a great way to re-experience the original game of 2017. Instead it once again subverts expectations by building upon this legacy and tells new stories that old veterans of the Literature Club as well as newcomers may enjoy. \n\nMany may argue that a free game of roughly six years of age didn't exactly need a new version. In fact, the original to this very day has an astounding modding scene that manages to expand a five to eight hour long visual novel into hundreds over hundreds of hours of playtime. \n\nHowever, by releasing this new version of the game, not only does the beloved Literature Club write its way into the hearts of console gamers yet intrigues veterans with added side story content that builds upon the esablished world while teasing a successor that has been eagerly awaited for quite a while by now.\n\nAs a Visual Novel, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus (or DDLC+ as I will know refer to it) you can't exactly expect any \"real\" gameplay from this game. While for many this may be a major downside, I can only recommend to give it a shot regardless. Not once does Doki Doki Literature Club use unnecessary padding to its story and respects its players time. Beyond that I'd argue that by what it tries to accomplish the Visual Novel was the perfect medium to use as a way to immerse the player while still creating an interactive experience, which movies and even books could not have conveyed in this specific manner.\n\nDDLC+ as well as the original are games that absolutely want you to experience them with as little knowledge as possible, so they can fully immerse you with their stellar soundtrack, deep characters and cleverly layed-out twists. Although the four girls may come of as cliche in the beginning, I can only advise newcomers to keep pushing forward so they come to fully understand why I am so strongly praising the complextiy of them. With six side stories to also collect, there is now even more depth to the girls, which have just about the right length to not undermine the main game and still make it a worthwhile puchase for old players.\n\nWith the use of the word collect, there are now galleries and soundtracks that can be harvested by simply playing the game or fulfilling certain requirements, some of which are based on luck, which can potentially be frustrating for those who seek a 100 percent archive. However these luck based collections are few and usually not absourdly unlikely. (The lowest chance for one of the gallery entries was 1:64 if I remember correctly, the second to that is a one to eleven chance that garantues one new entry per run, so as you see while it may be low these aren't anywhere near impossible)\n\nAs someone who invests a lot of time into immersing myself into such stories I easily reached up to 30 hours to get 100 percent completion. It is likely though that people can reach this feat with half of the time spent, so take that as you will.\n\nThe game memorizes dialogue that has been read once, so there is not once a moment where players can't quickly skim through DDLC+ to experience alternative dialogue, that may derive from the player's choices. DDLC+ knows how to combine all of the points I mentioned above (characters, soundtrack, interactive elements) to subtlely build up a connection to you that I'd bet to even surprise the more unreceptive individuals.\n\nWith all that, I do recommend to purchase this version, simply for the reason that one should support people such as Dan Salvato and his team that try new things to create immersive and memorable experiences. I still have my Yuri Plushie sitting next to me which reminds me of how one man has a better understanding of how to make me feel something than multi-million-dollar companies who sacrficed that aspect of gaming to simply create \"spectacular\" games, who often fall flat. \n\nThis game was the ultimate example of how to create a unique experience and judging by the size of its community, I'd argue I am not the only one to think this way.\n\nThank you Team Salvato and Serenity Forge for creating this worthwhile expansion to DDLC \nThank you for the community who to this day creates equally unique content and deserves high praise as well\nAnd thank you, reader, for taking this time to listen to my thoughts on this game!\n\nStay healthy and take care!", "timestamp_created": 1692609788, "timestamp_updated": 1692610101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144701942": {"recommendationid": "144701942", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215061369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 539, "last_played": 1692559182}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 For this genre.", "timestamp_created": 1692607396, "timestamp_updated": 1692607396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144690125": {"recommendationid": "144690125", "author": {"steamid": "76561199262135654", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2392, "last_played": 1692589346}, "language": "english", "review": "This game fucking rules", "timestamp_created": 1692588589, "timestamp_updated": 1692588589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144669955": {"recommendationid": "144669955", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076138313", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2784, "playtime_at_review": 24903, "last_played": 1700599512}, "language": "english", "review": "dont listen to the others.

[/h1]\n\nDeveloper: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/developer/serenityforge] Serenity Forge [/url]\nPublisher: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/serenityforge] Serenity Forge [/url] \nReleased: 30. Juni 2021\n\nIt seemed more like a cute, innocent visual novel than a psychological horror experience.\n\nThe game starts out harmless, but after a certain point something happens that changes everything. I don't want to go into too much detail here so as not to give away spoilers, but I can say that the game played brilliantly with my expectations and completely surprised me. The psychological horror set in and I actually found myself scared during a few scenes, which is quite an achievement for a visual novel.\n\nThe game change was really masterfully executed and added even more horror to the story. The creators managed to create a dark and eerie atmosphere that pulled me deep into the action and kept me playing despite the occasional goosebumps and scares.\n\nI found the ending particularly impressive as it touched me emotionally. When a very specific person started singing, I felt a mixture of sadness and admiration for the art of the game. It added an extra layer of depth to the already great experience and made it a memorable ending.\n\n[b] Just Monika <3 [/b] - a sentence that took on a whole new meaning after playing and stuck in my memory. Doki-Doki Literature Club Plus is a true must-see for anyone looking for a deep and unpredictable psychological horror game. The characters, the story, the music and the twists will pull you in and won't let go.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that this game exceeded my expectations and I recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and intense gaming experience.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1388880/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club_Plus/", "timestamp_created": 1692555814, "timestamp_updated": 1692555814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594681620597839355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144636648": {"recommendationid": "144636648", "author": {"steamid": "76561199043539086", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1046, "last_played": 1636803433}, "language": "english", "review": "Heavy Nostalgia Bias from 2017 - 2021 here:\n~ The OG Game is definitely one of the better indie games for its time // it's an experience you won't forget!\n~ I think the Side Stories are really wholesome // add alot of depth to each character through their collective interactions\n~ Definitely recommend if you resonate with or are passionate about mental health <3", "timestamp_created": 1692532511, "timestamp_updated": 1692532511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144633175": {"recommendationid": "144633175", "author": {"steamid": "76561199525627178", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1698768035}, "language": "english", "review": "A very cozy and cute game but at some occasions very unsettling.

games I've encountered, Team Salvato's DDLC undeniably provided me with the most captivating gameplay experience. The game is replete with intriguing in-game elements that warrant contemplation.\nTo commence, it's apparent without much effort that each female character possesses distinct flaws. This imparts a sense of realism to players, who subconsciously acknowledge the imperfections, thereby rendering each character more alluring and relatable. In essence, these imperfections in their personalities\u2014 [spoiler] such as Sayori's battle with depression, Natsuki's vulnerability due to domestic violence, Yuri's struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Monika's profound loneliness stemming from her realization that she can never transcend into the MC's reality [/spoiler] \u2014are pivotal in shaping the girls into fully fleshed-out characters.\n\n   This game diverges from the commonplace and clich\u00e9d dialogues that often permeate other PG18 gal games. In fact, the lore itself extends beyond mere interest; each line of the script holds significance and is inherently self-explanatory. This stands in stark contrast to perfunctory exchanges, often seen between friends with benefits, which tend to culminate in a merely lascivious conclusion to the narrative. Moreover, the inclusion of exquisite poems further enriches the experience, many of which serve as foreshadowing for impending events. These verses delve into the unsettling emotions that the girls grapple with when distanced from school, particularly from the MC. The backdrop of music also plays a pivotal role in enhancing both the conversations and the overall gaming experience, even in the absence of elaborate animations. Take, for instance, the theme music dedicated to the girls\u2014'Okay Everyone!' This composition readily exhibits the interplay of cello notes in the Yuri and Sayori adaptations. The cello's use by composers to convey sorrowful or mournful moments is apparent, implying the latent melancholy within the girls' emotions that ultimately manifests in their [spoiler] tragic suicide attempts [/spoiler].\n\n   Upon reflecting on the gaming experience, I've come to realize the abundance of heart-wrenching moments that merit acknowledgment. [spoiler] Foremost among these are the poignant scenes involving the two deceased girls. Sayori, a radiant presence, initially presents her customary cheerful facade at the story's outset. She shares with the MC, \"I love happiness the most, but sometimes when you have a little rain cloud in your head... a sad poem can help embrace the rain cloud... And create a beautiful, happy rainbow!\" However, towards the conclusion of the initial narrative arc, she tearfully confesses to the player, even after receiving the MC's heartfelt declaration: \"Even now... Why do the rain clouds persist? They refuse to dissipate at all...\" Tragically, she hangs herself the very next day. [/spoiler]\n\n   Conversely, we encounter Yuri.  [spoiler] Despite her outward appearance of maturity and composure within the club, she undergoes a gradual transformation from rationality to mild irrationality, culminating in complete madness as the MC's affection towards her increases. Ultimately, she confesses her feelings to the MC and\u00a0 in a brutal act inflicts three fatal stabs upon herself. Yuri's consciousness only resurfaces as blood pools begin to gather around her prone form on the floor, her amethyst eyes radiating an aura of regret into the void, a poignant reminder of an irreparable choice. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Who's to blame? [/h1]\n\n [spoiler]   Many attribute the blame to Monika for her manipulation of the thoughts and consciousness of the other three girls. Yet, upon delving into the game with a fourth playthrough, a question inevitably nags at me: is Monika genuinely accountable for this intricate situation? Upon closer inspection, I can't help but question whether Monika shoulders the entire responsibility. After all, every girl holds the potential to assume the role of the literature club president. Upon deeper reflection, it becomes apparent that the true antagonist might be the player themselves, lurking behind the scenes. When one ponders this scenario, the intricate layers unravel. [/spoiler]\n\n   The various side stories meticulously weave together a tapestry that portrays a comprehensive tableau: each of the four girls candidly unveils their vulnerabilities and imperfections, fostering a nurturing atmosphere where they support each other. This dynamic culminates in the establishment of the literature club, embodying a genuine camaraderie. However, with the entrance of the MC, the idyllic and cohesive picture disintegrates into disarray, and the virtues that once flourished crumble into oblivion.\n\n  Thankfully, as players, we retain the power to halt this descent into chaos. [spoiler] We possess the opportunity to save Monika from her tragic fate, avert the callous act of erasing her from the game, and instead, modding the game to offer her the affection she rightfully deserves. [/spoiler] In doing so, we can rekindle and nurture at least one iridescent remnant from the good ol\u2019 times of sunshine and rainbows, fostering a ray of hope amid the prevailing darkness.\n\n   Finally, a round of applause to Mr. Salvato and his team for bringing us the best visual novel of the decade, keep up the good work and hopefully surprise us again with something even more spectacular in the near future.\n\n[h1] Love from China [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1692154182, "timestamp_updated": 1692328330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144297560": {"recommendationid": "144297560", "author": {"steamid": "76561199532112736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1695517161}, "language": "english", "review": "haha murder", "timestamp_created": 1692142472, "timestamp_updated": 1692142472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144296521": {"recommendationid": "144296521", "author": {"steamid": "76561199145885907", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 360, "last_played": 1693316309}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely Perfect!, I really loved this game's thrill and the story/plot behind it, along with the characters, the twisted backstory, the ominous turn of events, all boiled down to the true ending of the game.

I'm sitting here clicking next and I have no dialog options, I can't influence the future, I can just be a bystander. I read a bit about the game and understand this choice, but it just gets boring when it becomes like a movie or a comic. Contrary to a movie, there is almost no animation; contrary to a comic, you have no scenery, dynamism, settings, etc. In summary, i get the feeling that I'm kinda on a railroad to wherever.\n\nedit: finally finished. you need help to get secret achievements. it's almost impossible to stumble across them. And the conditions to get the secret achievements are absolutely horrendous. Getting a good ending is overcomplicated for absolutely no obvious reason. You really just need a walkthrough. I didn't find any reward satisfying and found myself painfully skipping through boatloads of dialog time and again because i was hoping to see something good - any kind of reward. Everything is just painstakingly repetitive.\n\nEdit 2: Finally reached 100%. Never skipped so much dialog. I had stopped caring a long time ago. Achievements were my only rewards. Couldn't even enjoy some relationship narration with a chosen character, take em out for drinks and \"be a couple\" kinda. The game just happens without you.\n\nAnd I say all of that although i enjoyed the story and think it could have been great material.

This game took me on a ride that I'll never forget \u2013 a journey that was equal parts heartwarming and spine-tingling, leaving me utterly captivated from start to finish.\n\nAs I stepped into the world of the literature club, I never could've anticipated the emotional rollercoaster that awaited me. The characters \u2013 Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika \u2013 felt so real, like friends I've known for ages. That's what made the twists and turns of the narrative hit so hard. The way the story seamlessly transitioned from lighthearted banter to moments of eerie unease kept me on the edge of my seat.\n\nAnd speaking of Monika, she's a character unlike any I've encountered in a game before. Her subtle presence and the way she interacts with both the story and the player left me genuinely questioning the boundaries of the digital world. It's as if she's whispering secrets in your ear, guiding you through a narrative maze that you can't help but get lost in.\n\nThe direction of the game is simply masterful. It guides you through the emotional beats of the story with such precision that you can't help but become emotionally invested. The score adds another layer to the experience, evoking emotions that range from joy to discomfort.\n\nVisually, the game's simplistic style belies its impact. The characters' expressions, their mannerisms \u2013 they're all so well-crafted that you can't help but feel a connection. And while there aren't flashy effects, the game's subtle touches hit you in unexpected ways.\n\nBut what truly amazed me was how Doki Doki Literature Club played with my emotions. It took me from laughter to unease, from friendship to existential contemplation, all within the blink of an eye. It's this ability to toy with your feelings that makes the game an absolute masterpiece.\n\nSure, there are moments when the narrative's tone shifts abruptly, almost disorienting you. But here's the thing \u2013 it's deliberate. It adds a layer of complexity that challenges your perception, making you question the very essence of storytelling.\n\nIn the end, Doki Doki Literature Club isn't just a game; it's an experience that stays with you long after you've put down the controller. The emotions it evokes, the questions it raises \u2013 they all become a part of you. If you're ready for a narrative journey that defies conventions, that lingers in your mind, and that makes you question the very nature of reality, then this game is an absolute must-play.", "timestamp_created": 1691451423, "timestamp_updated": 1691796626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201315879821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143617212": {"recommendationid": "143617212", "author": {"steamid": "76561199508599086", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "playtime_at_review": 1231, "last_played": 1700611759}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Simplemente es el hermoso", "timestamp_created": 1691446903, "timestamp_updated": 1691446903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143593011": {"recommendationid": "143593011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175339803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1082, "last_played": 1691419538}, "language": "english", "review": "doki doki literature club plus", "timestamp_created": 1691419847, "timestamp_updated": 1691419847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143588335": {"recommendationid": "143588335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393300271", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 679, "last_played": 1691414597}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is amazing an with the addition of the launcher the secrets, achievements, music and extras are perfect.\n", "timestamp_created": 1691414690, "timestamp_updated": 1691414690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143582449": {"recommendationid": "143582449", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005090710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1387, "last_played": 1691419988}, "language": "english", "review": "this and ddlc are my gay awakening thank you dan salvato.

Is the original story changed? No. Is there enough side stories that were not in the original to make it worth buying? Absolutely. There's enough extra content in addition to the side stories that makes it worth buying. The virtual machine concept they added to it also made it more fun. If you're a fan of the original game that was given to us absolutely free, then pay for this cheap 15 dollar product. It is worth the price, trust me. I never bought any fan items online, have always enjoyed this masterpiece without paying a dime, and decided this was worth a try and it ended up being 100% worth it.\n\nMy only criticism: There's a couple achievements that rely on RNG drops, which I cannot stress how much I absolutely despise, but I endured them bc I love this game. If that's something that you have no desire to endure, then you can skip them as they're 100% optional and don't offer anything significant as far as storyline. It didn't take me long to get them, but I just despise those concepts. That's really the only negative thing I can say about this game (and maybe that's more Steam than Team Salvato?).\n\nI also wanted to add that I liked how you could turn off those trigger warnings. Having been through panic attacks, depression, sucide attempts and PTSD myself, I can say with full confidence the only thing that helped me feel like I gained back my sanity and control of my life is to face my fears head-on, and trigger warnings never benefited me whatsoever. There's studies that support trigger warnings are not effective and can even make things worse. With that being said, I know everyone is different, and facing my fears head-on only worked for me because I was the one that decided to pull the cord. If you're not ready and you need those trigger warnings, no judgment to you, but I just encourage you to make it a goal to work towards facing your fears head-on and to eventually remove the need for trigger warnings, and to make that decision yourself and not expect someone to force you into it. You will feel much more powerful and confident when you find the courage within yourself to face those fears. You can do it just like I did, I believe in you. You will know when the time is right for you. Believe in yourself. And I wanted to add I respect Team Salvato and Serenity Forge for giving the option to turn those on or off. Having the option to turn them off is just as important, if not more, than having the option to turn them on.\n\nI also wanted to add I love the new artwork that was not in the original. I love the new character artwork (photos, graphics), new side stories, new music. I especially loved some of the songs that were new but incorporated parts of the old songs into it. Nice bit of a remix, if you will. I remember being perfectly content one day just listening to the new music and scrolling through the artwork, without even playing the game, and I'm sure I'll have more days like that. It amazes me how much effort was put into such an affordable game, and that's why I've always respected Team Salvato.\n\nIf you're reading comments to see if it's worth buying, BUY IT!!! It's not that expensive anyways, just do it. You know you'll love it if you already played the original. If you're new to it, I'm telling you, you're in for a real treat.", "timestamp_created": 1690726468, "timestamp_updated": 1690726468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689546585083007813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143074488": {"recommendationid": "143074488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067641096", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1690712878}, "language": "english", "review": "Played it way back when the original game released and it holds up still to this day.

The meaning behind all the characters, the little secrets and all that kind of stuff make this game one of my favorites. It is not a simple game, you need to understand it and stay focus. (Claps for Dan Salvato!!)\n\n3. More than just a game, for me, It's a experience. It'll let you think about a lot of things, you will enjoy it, trust me.\n\n4. Lovely and good music. I can stay in the menu just with me vibing with the music \n\n[b]The bad side:[/b]\n\n1. It ends.\n\n[spoiler]For me, this game means so much. Dan Salvato is very smart and a very good and kind person. All the meaning behind about mental health, friendship, love, obsession, empathy and the message that Dan wants to share to the players. Not only that but the original secrets in the game like the files you can delete, the messages in Base64, the secrets images, mails and the lovely alternative stories.

Imma dissect this real good for you. As for the base game itself, unfortunately they changed pretty much nothing. The art is exactly the same just with a slightly higher quality, and the only real changes are slight dialogue edits (For example, the line at the end of the game where Monika mentions how she spoke to you on the game's steam page is no longer there as that is not the case for DDLC+). These dialogue edits are very subtle and you're likely to not notice them at all. The real bulk of the new content and the only real reason to buy this game is the side stories. I personally find them quite entertaining and heartwarming although i recommend experiencing them after finishing the main story, as stopping to watch the heartwarming story of the group member meeting each other then transitioning back to seeing them commit self harm is, as you can imagine, quite jarring. Also, there are actually 7 side stories, not six, a special one is unlocked for completing the other 6. Also also, the game is now run from a virtual desktop, which isn't really a positive or a negative tbh. I think they could've made the game even better by finding a way to implement the stories into the base game itself and helping it flow along with the rest of the story. There was no need to preserve the original experience imo especially considering that the original is free to experience for everyone. Overall its like a strong 8.8 or 9.0 out of 10. Id say the the original is a solid 8.3 so not a huge improvement but still notable. Ain't worth fifteen dollars tho if we're keeping it real, wait for it to go on sale. Not because its bad but because if the original was free i'd say the stuff they added does not come close to 15$ of value. Very easily could've been a 5$ or 10$ DLC TBH. But yeah if you enjoyed the original you'll like this.

They are a nice addition as a prequel and it gives all of the characters the actual backstory (somewhat) instead of a fan fic story of every character from a ddlc mod, each story would have been a bit nicer with a option to save so i wouldn't have to skip most of the story just because i had a power outage, about the collectibles (photos and mails) it's a nice addition trying to get every pic/art. DDLC Plus has a small issue for me, due to the game being build for console purposes there's much less easter eggs when you're exploring the file manager and it's also pretty much impossible to mod (for public) due to the new plus assets being against Dan Salvato's modding rules, except those small issues DDLC Plus is a straight up upgrade from the original(if you're looking for a vanilla + prequel expierence) however it's weak point of modding makes me kind of feel bad for console players who want thought they could mod this game but come on get real.

Re-playing it again after what must be about 5 years paying more attention it became a lot more apparent just how good the game is. The concept is interesting, I love the characters and the way the story handles itself just feels so good. the game starting to break in act 2 is done is such an effective way it genuinely feels creepy sometimes and when you go back to act one it's impressive how small, throwaway lines are cleverly hidden foreshadowing to the events further into the game and of the problems with each of the girls. The way the poems change based on the route you take and how you can subtlety pick out the problems in each poem such as Sayori's first poem having the line 'if it wasn't for you I could sleep forever' is also a great use of foreshadowing. I've only played the side-story 'trust' so far but they feel as good as the original and I can't wait to play more. couldn't recommend this game enough to anyone interested in playing it.

But if you had any enjoyment learning about the characters, you should definitely buy this game.\n\nIf you haven't played the original for some reason, play it first (it's free!).

really written a proper review for a game before but I had so much fun with this one I felt like I needed to write my thoughts on it a bit. All the new content is really cool but I have to say that the side stories alone makes the game worth buying. \n I liked having the virtual desktop as it felt like it fit more with the game rather than going into your actual files (and made it easier when I was recording my playthrough), plus having that affects the new lore added to the game. The lore itself, shown through \"emails\" I'm a little iffy on but everything else was really cool.  \n\nGetting 100% (both within the game and on Steam) definitely took some time and could be a little annoying. Not anything too difficult but there was a few things where I didn't know what I was missing so I had to look up a guide.  Some secrets and things have a 1/whatever chance of appearing so those can take a while to randomly show up and to get the steam achievements at least, you'll have to do multiple playthroughs. Luckily after your second playthrough you would have seen all the dialouge already so the game goes super fast as you can just skip everything and click through the poems. That makes it easier if you need to be in a specfic spot in the game or are trying to do multiple routes in one playthrough. Though it took me 18 hrs to 100% everything, i'd say a lot of the time was just from replaying the game or taking my time reading all the dialogue in the side stories, so if you're not trying to do everything in the game, then you'll get through it really fast.", "timestamp_created": 1687671199, "timestamp_updated": 1687671199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

(all good, ofc.) DDLC is an amazing game. But that's just in short. I've played the OG game without the extras about each character, and it's one of the few games I can go back and play over and over again. The writing is incredible, each of the girls has their each unique personalities and interests, and the psychological horror aspect still freaks me out to this day. Yes it has very cute, wholesome moments and a lot of scary aspects, but it also has a deeper meaning and dives into the struggles of mental health. Yes, the mental health aspects are taken to an extreme in this game, but there's really good moments about caring for each other, and the values of friendship. Each of the girls have a unique relationship with one another and that is truly special, and you can clearly see it in the OG game. Now for the added on extras of each character, they are sad enough to make a grown man cry. There's nothing scary, nothing hiding in your files to scare you, and no love interests. Just pure love and care from each of the girls to one another and their stories. Truly an amazing game and if you love the OG DDLC, appreciate the characters, then DDLC plus is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1687509111, "timestamp_updated": 1687509111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140540058": {"recommendationid": "140540058", "author": {"steamid": "76561199116392332", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1690259592}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute anime girls, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1687504619, "timestamp_updated": 1687504619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140531389": {"recommendationid": "140531389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148744892", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 371, "last_played": 1691072182}, "language": "spanish", "review": "QU\u00c9 JUEGAZO, LA PTM!

"review": "Honestly, it's like 99% similar to the main game.\n\nOne of the main differences is there's a virtual desktop now. That virtual desktop is where everything in the game is kept, including actually starting the game. There's also the folders with all the .chr files and other miscellaneous things.\nWhile I think the concept is cool, there's some flaws, and here's why I think that. (Contains spoilers)\n\nIf a brand new player buys this game and has never exposed themselves to DDLC ever, the virtual desktop will make it easier for them to find all the secret files. And even then, there's no hints that there's secret files in the first place. The player will have to randomly click on the folder on the virtual desktop to find them. \nSure, it did make it easier for new players to find them, since the player will never think to look in the game files until act 3 when Monika tells them about the files in there.\n\nSpeaking of act 3, it's more or less the same. However, Monika tells you about how the files are in a really easily accessible folder. In the first game, she tells you how to get to them by going to the game files. So in the end, it wouldn't have made a difference.\n\nAct 1 and 2 are also more or less the same.\n\nSo my final verdict is: There's really no reason to buy this game. It's almost identical to the original (free) one. If you saw the banner and thought the game would have improved graphics, well, no, the in game graphics weren't changed either.\n\n(Sorry if my review isn't very good, I don't write them very often)", "timestamp_created": 1686726058, "timestamp_updated": 1686726058, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677228689193725586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140034487": {"recommendationid": "140034487", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049552284", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 397, "last_played": 1686774546}, "language": "english", "review": "actually a very fun game that had me shocked throughout\ndef recommend 10/10 \n(nat best girl)", "timestamp_created": 1686724823, "timestamp_updated": 1686724823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140031063": {"recommendationid": "140031063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868663264", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1684031307}, "language": "english", "review": "girls cute,,, nothing else to say", "timestamp_created": 1686716663, "timestamp_updated": 1686716663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140028920": {"recommendationid": "140028920", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078482560", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1056, "last_played": 1697418587}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Pinche juego todo est\u00fapido y aburrido\n\nme encanto...", "timestamp_created": 1686711900, "timestamp_updated": 1686712007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713809192180633545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140026117": {"recommendationid": "140026117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046332908", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "playtime_at_review": 1119, "last_played": 1699916506}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH.

This is one of those games, a deceptively innocent fa\u00e7ade, a seemingly simple before seen concept, and then before you know it, drops the act to really sell one hell of a unique narrative.\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club is deceptive in its storytelling, and for someone like me who loves a good story full mystery and secrets, it was right up my alley. Yet it was the way in which it presented this narrative that grappled my interest. The front of a seemingly innocent visual novel of romance was as far removed from its true intentions as it could have ever been, but it is the contrast between its disguise and actuality that make it work so well.\n\nThe storytelling was only further fuelled by the meticulousness of the dialogue, the tone setting of the music or lack thereof in cases, and of course the beautiful artwork that didn\u2019t hold back even when things got graphic.\n\nBeyond its artistry, there isn\u2019t much else to it, game play mechanics are simple and the running time isn\u2019t tens of hours, but that\u2019s a good thing. It gives its focus where it needs to, it paces itself to hit all the right notes at all the right times. You can tell time and effort went into making it what it was, because there is no filler, there is no deviating from the main path, it is true to what it wants to be, and that is what makes it work so well.\n\nOn a final note then, Doki Doki Literature Club is a diamond among coals, a small narrative journey that questions the morals, that leads you unknowingly into more than you came for.

Cre\u00ed que ser\u00eda de esos juegos que solo busca tener un giro de guion impresionante, pero no, la verdad es que va mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1 y ofrece una experiencia muy diferente a lo que otras novelas visuales nos tienen acostumbrados.

Tampoco es que haya un tremendo desarrollo en la historia o en los personajes, el juego no busca eso, tiene su propia forma de contarte las cosas, y toca temas oscuros e interesantes que vale la pena analizar.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, recomendar\u00eda a quienes lo jueguen que [b]no busquen nada por internet [/b], no miren gu\u00edas ni nada, no piensen en buscar un final perfecto o seguir una ruta de forma perfecta; cr\u00e9anme, solo disfruten de la experiencia, porque eso es lo m\u00e1s valioso en este juego.

[strike]Most likely nobody or at the very least few people are going to read this[/strike] but I felt inclined to write something for this masterpiece of a game. This won't even be a review, this game means a lot to me and lots of other people and it felt wrong not to write some kind of love letter or anything at all, so here goes...\nStarting of a list of what makes DDLC, in my eyes, one of the best story driven games ever created:[/b]\nCleverly deceiving game design; Perfect psychological horror experience; Realistic depiction of people's hardships and mental issues (DDLC+ especially); Purposefully 'cringy' designed characters using typical anime tropes, to made them seem like typical Dating Sim girls (og DDLC), yet with the introduction with DDLC+ they became something much more; REALLY catchy and memorable soundtrack with repeating leitmotif, that makes you want to bust a move, and depending on the context can be either happy or unsettling (og DDLC); One of the best soundtracks in the video game I've ever heard (DDLC+); Cute girls ;Actually good poetry and writing advices, that makes you want to write something yourself or at least pick up a book to read; [spoiler]4th wall breaking, making YOU the part of the game's story, and which for example, takes advantage of how the game behaves when certain files are missing; (Along with Undertale/Deltarune) One of the most interesting Lore, that still keeps me invested in the game today, told mostly through game files and unlockable in-game emails. Despite game being popular, not many people know how deep this game is. (Mention what 'Metaverse Enterprise Solutions' or 'VM1/VM2' is to avarage DDLC fan and they'll think you're crazy); Game's story take's place in multiple universes and timelines; Light time travel themes; Monika's character is genius (More on her bellow); Monika's Act III dialogue - she's suprisingly smart with a lot of quaity life advices.[/spoiler] Room for fan interpretations of the game - that's where Modding Community comes in. There's a lot of high quality mods that either expand the original game concept or turn the game 180 degrees telling completely different story with familiar faces.\n\n[b][i]*BIG SPOILERS* Few words about Monika's character and her story, an analysis if you will:[/i][/b]\nMonika (in the main game) is a regular high school girl with the for literature, who one day got access to knowledge and abilities that no human should ever possess, knowledge that would traumatize many or even made someone take their life. An ability to see past the artificial reality and change the world around her to her own will. Yet, although not exactly sane, she stands tall, smiling, holding onto her hopes that one day perhaps she will leave this prison or at the very least get a taste of the world outside of her reach, making her really admirable character. Cannonically DDLC universe, originally was never supposed to be a game, at first it was a only a simulated universe created(?) by company called 'Metaverse Enterprise Soulutions' that was ment to be used for gathering data and ovserving behavior of the human-like entities inside. Said company is also responsible for Monika's powers (Elevated Access, is what they call it), they gave her those powers in order to observe how a person might behave to an exposure of such knowledge, as well as trying to find clues and patterns present in both simulated and real world to try find proof that OUR universe is also simulated.\nWith that out of the way - In order for Monika to get a glimpse of our world, she had to manufacture a way for us to interact with her world. That's how MC, the character we play as was created, or at least Monika's meddling with the code made him join the Literature Club. That is when MES decided to disguise their simulation under the cover of a 'video game'. Throughout the early part of the game, Monika is trying to keep her composure in check, trying to be 'normal' yet desirable to the player, without making any sudden moves, but also not making [i]no[/i] moves at all, each day she gives the player slight hints of the person she is behind the mask, through her 'abstract' poetry. At the same time, she gradually increases Sayori's depression and later in the game as she get's more and more desperate and impatient, Yuri's obsessive traits as well as Natsuki's terrible home life, everything by changing their code to make them 'less desireble' and prevent them from confessing, unfortunately that doesn't go exactly as planned cause they end up confessing anyway, after all, she's just a high school girl with no experience in coding, trying to make changes, not a computer expert. But there are also few more mistakes Monika makes, first being on a moral level - her reasoning states that 'if nothing is real, then it's ok to kill and whatnot'. Monika clearly haven't thought that through, her desperation really shows, she's forgetting that she is as real as them, she is a part of this world. For us players, killing video game characters is nothing crazy, we do that all the time without giving it much thought, but Monika's case isn't so black and white, when the world around you, fake or not, is the place you were born, is your home, is the place were you made friends, killing people, literary is the equivalent of US murdering someone irl (but in her defense, I wonder how would YOU behave if you were in her place). She also believes that 'her friends don't have free will, they're just lines of code', half of the statement is in fact true, but she overlooked the fact that along with the changes she makes, Natsuki for example, reacts accordingly to the situation, her letter to MC about how she's worried about Yuri, doesn't exactly seemed like something Monika planned, rather it is something that Natsuki willingly wrote. That's not exactly reading script, is it Monika? Based on that fact, for me it makes the characters much more like an AI rather than mindless NPCs chained to their script (which they technically and cannonically are). Since she can change almost anything, wouldn't a smarter option be to either try completely change their personality to something that would keep her sane, to have some company or at least try to explain her bizzare situation to other girls and support one another? Imagine an ending in the style of Act III like that, where every girl is aware of players presence, and you can visit them from time to time by opening the game and talk to them idividualy as they live their lifes with their newfound knowledge. Don't mind me, I'm just fantasizing.\nAnyway, her another mistake ties to the last one - As her original plan of pursuing the player failed, due to the game not letting us chose her, Monika getting impatient is willing to sacrifice the whole world, risking accidentally deleting herself for something that has no guarantee of working out, have she even taken into consideration how the person on the other side might feel about her plan? For a player, she's still only a video game character, they might have just wanted to play regular dating sim, but at the end were forced to play by her rules. That is not what someone on the right mind does - erasing everything from existance, but an empty room you plan to sit in till the end of time, with a person whom you'll likely never even see (...)\n\nBruh, I had to delete a big chunk of this, because it was too long. So I guess that concudes this 'review', I don't even know how to end this long ass elaboration, since steam left it hanging.

The cute appearance of this game is deceiving, putting you in comfort and then slowly making you feel the essence of its hidden genre. The story does not take long to complete, although it took me about ~45 hours to reach full completion, perhaps with some procrastination. Just keep in mind that there is an RNG-based achievement.\nAs amazingly terrifying as this game is, I would [u]only recommend buying it if you're a fan[/u]. All the newly added things: [i]CGs, music player, mail messages[/i], and of course, the side stories, perhaps wouldn't appeal to regular players.

The characters are well-written and engaging, and their stories are compelling and heart-wrenching.\n\nWhat sets Doki Doki Literature Club apart from other visual novels is its use of metafiction and psychological horror elements.

The fourth-wall breaking moments are especially effective in creating a sense of unease and discomfort.\n\nDespite its dark themes, Doki Doki Literature Club also has moments of warmth and genuine emotion. The friendship and romance between the characters are touching and heartwarming, and the game's soundtrack is beautiful and haunting.\n\nOverall, Doki Doki Literature Club is a must-play for anyone who enjoys visual novels or psychological horror games.

I still think about it often.\n\nAnyway, I have mixed feeling about the main game, but bought this for the side stories. They didn't disappoint. The creepypasta aspects are dropped for a series of quiet, sympathetic tales that treat the cast--and their insecurities/illnesses--with discretion and empathy, away from the dating-sim harem nonsense and overt fourth-wall destruction (Note: I do acknowledge both of these things were imperative to the original narrative's purpose. Even so, I stand by the point). It felt like closure, labelled seperate from the main story and only being unlocked after it--even though they're collectively considered a \"prequel\" or \"alternate timeline\" of sorts, I know. I guess, canonically, the whole thing could be a ploy for [spoiler]Monika to learn more about emotions and how to manage (and ultimately exploit) them[/spoiler]. Either way, if you played DDLC back in 2018 for the horror, and came away caring more about the characters, it's heartwarming content with some surprisingly touching things to say. Roast me for being soppy; don't care.\n\nThe real question is, if you were getting jumped by ten ops in East London, who's gonna back you: Yuri or Natsuki? Natsuki's got the gully attitude, but Yuri's got the zombie knife collection and packs a skeng at all times. These are difficult questions; questions which Dan Salvato never tackles, so I can't rate the game as highly as I'd like.

acompa\u00f1amientos visuales (efectos, mas que nada) y sonoros.\nPor la cantidad de horas en la mayor\u00eda de personas te dar\u00e1s cuenta de que no es un juego especialmente largo, pero es muy seguro que lo disfrutaras y yo recomendar\u00eda disfrutarlo como una experiencia.\nEsta hecho con bastante amor y esmero, lo considero uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado, cuando lo termine me quede pensando algo de tiempo y vaya, yo antes tenia la concepci\u00f3n de que era un juego que iba por el puro shock value para causar alg\u00fan tipo de sentimiento, pero ya teniendo la oportunidad

I first played it at a time in my life where I was very lost, and while it\u2019s not like it necessarily \u201cfixed\u201d any of the issues I was having, but it did provide me tons of comfort and something to get obsessed with while I was struggling. Obviously since this title means so much to me, the announcement of an enhanced version of the game known as \u201cDoki Doki Literature Club+\u201d was really really exciting for me. Now that I\u2019ve finally gotten my hands on the title and played it to completion, I feel inclined to share my thoughts on the new content and improvements, not only as a reviewer but as diehard fan of the original release of this title. I will try my best to avoid any focal spoilers for this re-release and the original release, but for the sake of this review having more merit than me simply saying \u201cI liked it\u201d, I will need to spoil a few gameplay aspects.\n\nSo lets start off with the obvious question, what exactly is DDLC+? Whilst in the simplest of terms, it is a re-release of the original DDLC with improved graphics that recontextualizes a lot of plot elements, making you view them in a new light, it also features new hidden collectables and a collection of side stories that follow a very wholesome new storyline.\n\nThese new side stories that I mentioned also have new music tracks, poems, CGs(A term commonly used to refer to digital paintings in visual novels) and of course new story elements. The side stories are fun and where you\u2019ll be spending the bulk of your time when it comes to new content in this title. The side stories (with a few exceptions) follow different pairings of the four main characters of the game, Sayori, Monika, Natsuki and Yuri. These side stories are full of heartwarming moments (and heavy lesbian undertones). These side stories also happen to provide some context to events like how the literature club actually started, though the canonicity of most of these events is questionable, since some of it conflicts with the established narrative in the main game.\n\nA welcome addition to Doki Doki Literature Club+ is the ability to turn on trigger warnings for some of the darker elements of the experience. DDLC occasionally dives into sensitive subject matter, and this version of the game give the player the ability to turn on trigger warnings before reaching those darker scenes. Personally, I did not use them, since I\u2019m a seasoned veteran with this title, but they\u2019re there for those who want them (I do not suggest using them, but to each their own).\n\nAn aspect that I had very mixed feelings about with Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is what I\u2019ll refer to as the \u201ccollectable hunting\u201d phase of the game. You see, I\u2019m burdened with glorious purpose, so I felt the need to 100% this title, and while I do think that\u2019s worth doing, a certain aspect of this game can make this completion run be\u2026 quite a chore. You see, to unlock the vast majority of the collectable images in this game (Promo art, concept art, etc) you need to grind replaying the main DDLC scenario over and over again, they improved the \u201cskip\u201d feature, which makes this less of a chore than it could\u2019ve been, but near the end of the game I needed 2 more secret poems, and it unironically took me 15+ runs through the game for these random chance poems to spawn. For the most part, I enjoyed the collectables since it makes you explore the main scenario more thoroughly than I ever have before, but the downside is it adds a lot of padding if you\u2019re going for a 100% run like I was. You get a neat reward for 100% the game, so I do suggest doing it, but it can be overly time consuming when I feel like it didn\u2019t need to be that way.\n\nSpeaking of the main scenario, while DDLC+ has a significant amount of new content, very little of it affects the main scenario which is where you\u2019ll be spending most of your time still, so I found that to be very disappointing. If you were looking for major changes across the main scenario, I regret to inform you that in that aspect, this game falls short.\n\nI can\u2019t go into to details about this for the sake of spoilers, but I really do think that this release of Doki Doki Literature Club, makes certain aspects of the game such as story immersion much weaker, at least when it comes to the recycled content it has with the original. They made an odd decision with this game that I overall think pays off but the immersion gets axed a bit to do it. I suggest playing the original freeware release of DDLC before playing DDLC+, like I said, I can\u2019t exactly get into why, but just trust me with this, this game should not be the jumping on point for newcomers to the series.\n\nThis version of Doki Doki Literature Club has new lore revelations, so if you\u2019re a fan but your on the fence with buying this title, trust me, there\u2019s a lot of new stuff to sink your teeth into, but if you\u2019re a newcomer? Play the freeware version first, and then Plus, I can\u2019t get into why without spoiling things but trust me.\n\nIn conclusion, here are my thoughts summarized on DDLC+; Doki Doki Literature Club+ is a phenomenal re-release of the original, it adds a ton of new content and recontextualizes everything in a very fun way. As a fan of the original, I am very impressed with DDLC+ and it is definitely one of my game of the year contenders. With all that being said, I do think the game is lacking for newcomers for numerous reasons, and I would suggest to newcomers to just play the freeware version first. For fans though? This game is a must.\n\nHats off to you Dan Salvato, you did it again, you mad man!", "timestamp_created": 1678232972, "timestamp_updated": 1678232972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580399036407470703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134241640": {"recommendationid": "134241640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082900939", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1782, "last_played": 1678198326}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but wonderful story which I can recommend to everyone who can stomach the horror scenes, but wants to continue reading to understand each character in-depth.

Just wow. Where to start? The game sells itself as a wholesome, high-school teen story, revolving four different indistinguishable characters with their own personality and trait that you can easily fall in love with. You start building up your relationship to these characters by writing poems devoted towards each character, where your choice of words will decide which character becomes more friendly and which ones more hostile (Yuri best girl btw). But if that was all of it, you might wonder why this game has so many dark tags attached to it, in connection with all the wholesome stuff? In order for me to avoid spoilers so you can experience this masterpiece yourself first-hand, I am limited to only saying that the story has a dark side to it and everything is not as rainbows and butterflies as the game might fool you to believe. As if that was not enough, this game shares a banger of a soundtrack like almost every other visual novel does. I don't know who they are hiring for these soundtracks, but damn. This game will leave you \"hanging\" wanting more after playing it and one quick look at the community will just tell you how much this game have affected them and longing for more Doki Doki content that will probably never see the light of day. From personal experience, this game moved me and made me teary-eyed. Really emotional game that awoke buried feelings I had deep inside me I did not know existed. I don't know what it was; the well-written characters, the soundtrack, the story itself or all of these combined together to create a masterpiece? Probably the latter. Hands down, one of the best games I have ever played, and if there is something entertainment is supposed to do, is to make you feel for it or give it a second thought, which most modern movies and games forgot to do and just focuses on feeding you mindless content. So all in all, this is a literal gem when it comes to video games. One of those \"must-plays\" in my opinion. If anything, this game will always be a fond memory for the rest of my life, which I cannot say about most games I have played. Edit: Adding on the review now after playing the side-stories, I can without a doubt say that this game is an 11/10. I was a bit reluctant at first because of how emotional this game made me after playing through the main story, but then I played through the side-stories, and oh boy. It was 100% worth it. Playing the side-stories fleshed out the characters in addition to the main game and just makes you wish that was how the game actually ended (the ending we never got). I really don't know any other way to put it cause the side-stories kept throwing stuff at you that you always wanted to see but never did. Call if fan-service if you want, but I see it as the complete picture. The main story is just one frame, meanwhile the side-stories are the rest of the painting you don't see. And oh boy, did they outdo themselves with the soundtrack again. They need to stop making these bangers for visual novels man. It should be illegal at this point. All in all, this game made me go from happy, to an emotional wreck and back to being more happy than I was before. My satisfaction is unmeasurable, and words are not enough to describe it.

I just recently played, and now I'm going to express my own thoughts about the game.\n\nFirst of all, if you're playing DDLC for a romantic plotline and cute interaction with the characters, well, don't expect much and lower your expectations, because I couldn't find what I was looking for in terms of the aforementioned aspects and you'll not find them either. \nDoes it mean the game is bad? Well, definitely no! Just don't expect wholly different themes about a game with different purposes.\n\nThe game starts in a classic high school setting. You play as a generic high school boy with a childhood \"girl friend\" named Sayori (not as romantic). She convinces you to join the Literature Club at school, where you meet other characters like Monika, Yuri, and Natsuki. All of the girls have different personalities. Monika is calm and collected, mature; Sayori is energetic and cheerful; Yuri is shy and kind; and Natsuki is blunt but honest. After you get familiar with them, there's a task every day you need to do, and that is writing poems for girls. Here comes the little game about choosing the correct words for each girl and trying to appeal to their tastes. Sometimes there are some choices to be made as well regarding some different situations, and that's the spoiler-free brief about the game. After a few days, things start to get bizarre and uneasy, and that's the point where the real story begins. Really, I can't describe more without spoilers, so I'm going to end it here.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that DDLC is not a generic romantic VN, unlike its cover, and there are numerous plot twists and surprises. Although the story is well thought out and executed, I wish the game was longer. You should be able to finish it in about 4 hours. The game's saving grace is that it's very replayable, and believe me, you'll find yourself replaying it as soon as you finish it once and trying to come up with alternate endings. However, the choices you made were simply too few and had no effect on the game's scenario. There is a predetermined ending that cannot be avoided no matter what you do, and I know I said before that replayability is excellent, but not because of the choices; you will replay anyway because you will want to learn more about the characters and their backgrounds. One gameplay is insufficient for this, so you'll find yourself writing poems for each girl in order to learn more about them with every new game run.\n\nTo conclude, despite its shortcomings, I recommend this to both visual novel fans and newcomers to the genre.

The game forces you to think outside the box (and outside the game itself). Doki Doki Literature Club Plus adds much more depth to each individual character, and makes you feel connected to the characters even more. I think it is definitely worth buying if you want to experience different backstories and extra content, but even more importantly, it gives depth to the characters that is not as much in the original base game, enabling you to empathise with the different girls and their different values, traits, and personal problems. Along with these side stories, DDLC plus is filled with beautiful illustrations, a soundtrack which can be customised, and much more lore (if you are into the theory side, lore-wise.) Overall, I would say that Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is one of my favourite Visual Novels out there, if not one of my favourite games in general.

anterior (la versi\u00f3n original).\n\nHaber, honestamente no soy digamos un fan del g\u00e9nero de novelas visuales, solo DDLC y Katawa Shoujo serian los \u00fanicos de este g\u00e9nero que jugar\u00eda (Steins gate no porque ya me vi su anime [tremenda obra maestra]), yo jugu\u00e9 este titulo debido a su gran popularidad debido a que se le conoc\u00eda por tener momentos espeluznantes o escenas fuertes, entonces decid\u00ed probarlo porque era gratis y que puedo decir, me encant\u00f3, sus personajes, historia y forma original de los eventos que si llega a inquietar un poco fueron bastante buenos, pues el simple hecho de que uno de los personajes sabe que esta dentro de un videojuego y viendo como ella misma toma el control de el y se deshace de las dem\u00e1s chicas para que se quede sola con nosotros es algo que no se ve todos los d\u00edas en una novela visual, lo que hace Doki doki literature club mas que un juego, fue mas una experiencia, que ya sea buena o inquietante como sea que la percibiste todos coincidimos en que el final nos deja un vaci\u00f3 a todos nosotros despu\u00e9s de todo lo que experimentamos, y que al final no podemos cambiarlos.......o bueno, podemos mejorarlo, pero sigue sin ser suficiente.\n\nBien, ahora esta versi\u00f3n Plus se puede interpretar como una versi\u00f3n extendida del titulo, si bien la historia principal sigue igual, tenemos como a\u00f1adido nuevas historias paralelas que nos cuenta como fue la llegada de cada una de las integrantes del club y como se forjo su relaci\u00f3n y que puedo decir, fue hermoso verlo; ademas de esto y a\u00f1adir cosas bonus como ver las im\u00e1genes, fondos, secretos, etc; tambi\u00e9n este titulo expandi\u00f3 el lore de este titulo aun mas d\u00e1ndonos mas muestra de que esto es mas que una novela visual de 4 chicas formando un club de literatura.\n\nY acerca de las 4 chicas, son pocas, pero son mas que suficientes e irreemplazables, tenemos a:\n\n Sayori: nuestra amiga de la infancia que su mayor caracter\u00edstica es su gran optimismo, dicho optimismo con el fin de ocultar su depresi\u00f3n y evitar que las personas se preocupen por ella.\n\nNatsuki: una peque\u00f1a chica con alto car\u00e1cter malhumorado pero es bastante amante del manga que le a servido para refugiarse y tener un sustento de alivio ante sus traumas debido a los abusos de su propio padre.\n\nYuri: una chica que a primera vista luce t\u00edmida e introvertida pero en el fondo es una amante de la literatura del genero horror/gore gener\u00e1ndole un gusto obsesivo por este tipo de cosas, cosa que ha hecho que no a podido conseguir ninguna amiga antes debido a sus extravagantes gustos (ademas de su f\u00e1cil obsesi\u00f3n hacia cualquier cosa).\n\nMonika: una \"chica\" talentosa que form\u00f3 un club de literatura para crear un lugar donde todos puedan sentirse c\u00f3modos, siendo esta decisi\u00f3n su mayor error.\n\nSi te preguntas si vale la pena comprar este titulo, pues te dir\u00e9 deque si eres fan o no igualmente es un completo si, ya que este titulo es bastante completo (pas\u00e1rselo al 100% toma un chingo de tiempo) y no te decepcionar\u00e1, y si eres fan con mayor raz\u00f3n compratelo ya que lo sentir\u00e1s mas como un regalo que un juego solamente, honestamente un juego que te da una experiencia que se lo recomiendo a todos; no temas en probar este titulo ya que hey, este es solo un juego acerca de un club de literatura, verdad?", "timestamp_created": 1674341776,

Having now played DDLC+ instead of getting sleep I can say I have no regrets. DDLC+ is a perfect example of the psychological horror genre and it truly is a new way to feel fear. However, this isn\u2019t just a horror game and because of its incredible concept I\u2019ll have a hard time forgetting it. I\u2019ve replayed it multiple times and I\u2019ve fallen in love with the incredible design of Doki Doki Literature Club! \n\nThe visual novel and dating side of DDLC+ is perfectly crafted and could easily be taken as a stand alone game. Each of the girls have colorful personalities and the interactions are well thought out. The 6 new side stories you get with DDLC+ do a great job at building the relationships between the girls while going in depth about the forming of the literature club. I also loved how rereading not only the poems but also the characters' dialogue reveals little hints as to what the true nature of the story is. \n\nThe horror side of this game is really what steals the show and it\u2019s a must try. The way this game scares you is by slowly making you notice that things are off and by giving you hints of what\u2019s hidden beneath the cracks. The growing unease you have while playing the game is chilling and the fear you feel isn\u2019t something that you can see and completely grasp. This is what makes DDLC\u2019s horror absolutely terrifying because it builds up inside you and gets into your head.\n\nThis version of the game does lose some of its immersion because you don\u2019t get to interact with the real game files. However, DDLC+ does make it easy to quickly revisit scenes and poems from the game without having to play through it again and again. I found the virtual desktop rather handy and I spent a good amount of time listening to this game's outstanding OST while looking at sketches, poems, and CGs offered in the Plus version. So for convenience and especially for the side stories I seriously recommend DDLC+!\n\nI\u2019m not writing a 5 paragraph essay so I\u2019ll leave it at that but if you are hesitating on buying DDLC+ I would definitely recommend you give it a shot. I can\u2019t think of any other game that portrays psychological horror as good as DDLC does while also blending in a cute visual novel and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love this masterfully designed game! Just be ready to replay the game a few times if you're looking to unlock all the content and see all the possibilities. I hope everyone can have as good of an experience with this game as I did and remember to spend time with Monika! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust Monika\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1673641679, "timestamp_updated": 1673641679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130764170": {"recommendationid": "130764170", "author": {"steamid": "76561199001729597", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1689195971}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Necesito fondos y stickers de este juego, te amo DDLTP aunq me hiciste entrar en depresi\u00f3n severa y me llenaste de traumas <3", "timestamp_created": 1673621113, "timestamp_updated": 1673621113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503866016864776611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130745748": {"recommendationid": "130745748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013101141", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 897, "last_played": 1630202763}, "language": "english", "review": "To be clear, its a \"support the developers\" game, not a sequel to the original free game.

This game goes DEEP into each character and how their personalities bring them closer to each other. It's time worth investing if you have loved this game since first release or you have just heard of this game and want to learn more about the girls. Not only that, but the structure is a lot easier to go around in comparison to the first edition, as you can access files easier AND music to find your favorite track (if you're interested). There is more to play with in DDLC Plus than the first edition, so if you want to get ALL the data you have to play it more than once! So, only get it if you feel investing the time is worth it!

(This review will be a continuation of my last review on DDLC.)\n\nAt first, when I purchased this game I thought it lacked content. It wasn't until I dug deeper into the array of additional easter eggs and images that I was proved wrong. If you are a fan of the first game and want to dig deeper into the lore then I would suggest you play this game.\n\nThe game is now accessed through a simulated faux-desktop. At your desktop you have a number of options: files, wallpapers, mail, side stories, pictures and music. All of which are unlockable from playing the base game.\n\nThe aim is for the player to gain as much \u2018data\u2019 as possible. By collecting all the data you will obtain all achievements. Along the way you unlock images, wallpapers and also the \u2018Side Stories\u2019 ; these are the most noticeable new element added to the game. The side stories reveal more about each of the four girls present in DDLC. There is a disclaimer however that the side stories are\u201cnot canon to the main story\u201d. \n\nThe email function explains the purpose of the game. We find out there is another name for the base game, which is VM1. We also learn that there is a VM2. If you thought VM1 had dark themes then VM2 will blow your mind. We learn that in VM1 the game creators have given Monika a heightened conscience to see how it affects the game and see how she reacts. This results in her deleting Sayori, Natsuki and Yuri out of jealousy. When you reset the game through the files function it says \u2018Monitor_Kernal_Access] \u2019 which is how Monika got her name. Moni from \u2018Monitor\u2019 and the ka from \u2018Kernel Access\u2019 Monika. This also explains why her name is the only name in the game that doesn't sound japanese. \n\nAn email titled \u2018Issues caused by unprotected memory\u2019 states that \u201cMy best guess is that memory being freed from VM2 isn't getting zeroed out, which technically gives VM1 access to it\u201d. This means something horrific when you look deeper into the lore of VM2. Monika has memories of VM2 while being present in VM1. We get a picture that VM2 is some sort of cult-like reality where people are experimented on to find their \u201cthird eye potential\u201d. People are theorizing that Sayori, Natsuki and Yuri are the ones being experimented on and Monika is a nurse in this reality, in VM2. Also it seems likely she will be called \u2018Marla\u2019 here as the email about VM2 aka \u2018Project Libitina\u2019 reads \u201cMonitor Adjacent Runtime-Level Access\u201d \n\nThis would explain why monika asks for our help. At one point in the game she ends her poem with \u201cdelete her\u201d she is making this in reference to Yuri who is becoming evermore unhinged by this point in the game. Then a box appears saying \u201cplease help me.\u201d and we have no choice but to click \u2018ok\u2019. This could be in reference to many things but after the poem asking us for help with deleting Yuri I feel that's what it is referencing. \n\nI mentioned before why she might be deleting these characters files. I said she might be jealous, however with this new found information about VM2 it could change Monika\u2019s ulterior motives entirely. Motives could be far removed from any jealous attack that the last game has given Monika a reputation for. We know that Monika is very smart and this is shown throughout the game; she writes in a mature way, she changes the game files of the game, and it is even theorized that Monika has found a way out of the game. We know she is able to access memories from VM2 and that could very well be why she wants these character files gone because she doesn't want to see any more harm coming to these three individuals, her friends. There is an email that reads \u201cMonika\u2019s meddling is less clumsy than we think\u201d all I can say is that I don't think anyone should underestimate Monika. \n\nMonika knows not to speak about VM2 because in the third chapter of the game she begins to speak about the book Yuri was reading but then stops herself, as she knows better than talking about the book with us, as it is about the world of VM2. This reaffirms how clever she is. How she knows she is being watched. This also impacted her attitude when Yuri and Sayori died because she doesn't want the game makers to suspect anything. She wants them to believe she wants attention from us the player, Insead of what she really feels, that she doesn't want her friends to be experimented on. \n\nThis game breathes new life and lore to a game that was released 4 years prior.

This game has good ideas and a fun gameplay loop that hooked people for a reason. Now it's other aspiring VNs jobs to learn from DDLCs successes and mistakes to make even better games.\n\nAnd Sayori's monologue about depression is still so real. The game is worth it for that three minute period alone, regardless of everything else.\n\nChalking this up to streamer bait and nothing more is like throwing sand in your own eyes if you give a damn about VNs at all.

Podemos llegar a comprender un poco mas los motivos por las cuales se decidieron unir en primer lugar.\n\nOtro punto a favor es el como se logro portear para consolas y agregarle un men\u00fa mas agradable y bonito. ademas de agregar las canciones base como algunas secretas necesarias para conseguir el 100% del juego.\n\nAlgo que me agrado fue el re dise\u00f1o que les dieron a las Dokis, es algo est\u00e9tico pero es de agradecer. de igual forma mencionar que la m\u00fasica del juego es relajante y se puede poner en una peque\u00f1a playlist dentro del propio juego lo cual es curioso cuando menos.\n\nEn resumen, un juego que recomiendo bastante para pasar el rato si quieres una historia fuera de lo com\u00fan que suelen tener este tipo de juegos, al menos las 22 hrs que le pude meter el juego fueron suficiente para conseguir el 100% del juego e incluso disfrutar de cada una de las historias secundarias de las Dokis para entender sus motivos de como llegaron ahi. \n\nEste juego lo recib\u00ed como regalo de alguien especial as\u00ed que ya forma parte de mi coraz\u00f3n junto a sus recuerdos\n\nSimplemente...

You will have to play the game over and over again if you want a 100% achievement completion, so don't aim for that if you don't want to go through this over and over again.\n\nI personally did play DDLC (a few times) before buying DDLC+ and i'm very pleased with the game iv'e gotten.\nIs it worth the price? that's for you to decide, but i'd say it is.\n\nIf you're getting the game, i do hope you find it well! (As much as you can that is.)\nThanks for reading, and have a good day.", "timestamp_created": 1671307137, "timestamp_updated": 1671307282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745989680290222168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128722561": {"recommendationid": "128722561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071305819", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78, "last_played": 1671267747}, "language": "english", "review": "I Uninstall it because I have a life", "timestamp_created": 1671279400, "timestamp_updated": 1671279400, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.363133400678634644", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128701090": {"recommendationid": "128701090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970627765", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1626824149}, "language": "english", "review": "AIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE NOT THE DOOR NOT AGAIN", "timestamp_created": 1671248175, "timestamp_updated": 1671248175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128698748": {"recommendationid": "128698748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310857647", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3363, "last_played": 1662781455}, "language": "english", "review": "i just wanted to hold their hands and write poems bro", "timestamp_created": 1671244761, "timestamp_updated": 1671244761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128696609": {"recommendationid": "128696609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198995057282", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 31360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31347, "last_played": 1671242283}, "language": "english", "review": "This game got me messed up", "timestamp_created": 1671241497, "timestamp_updated": 1671241497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128686787": {"recommendationid": "128686787", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101356615", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 593, "last_played": 1680305138}, "language": "english", "review": "I Spend 4 hours to get 'Dan says Hi' , im not okay", "timestamp_created": 1671227318, "timestamp_updated": 1671227318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128648771": {"recommendationid": "128648771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845195201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1671175527}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1671175603, "timestamp_updated": 1671175603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128637774": {"recommendationid": "128637774", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970796750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1670806332}, "language": "english", "review": "Well as much as I loved the first one I bought this one thinking it would have either enhance sprites or more animation or more story and creepy factor and what I got is the EXACT same stories with side stories that I don't care for and the HUD is a bit more friendly I guess.

"review": "A classic anime visual novel that excels at genre bending,  psychological horror, 4th wall breaking, self-awareness, and game design. Worth experiencing blind, if possible. The Story and Characters are not ground-breaking, but definitely tug on your heartstrings, especially the new Side Stories included in this version exclusively. Soundtrack is fantastic to listen to and really sets the tone for each scene. Visuals are quite impressive for a visual novel. \n\nThe game isn't perfect though. There isn't much gameplay aside from a poem minigame, choosing which girl to follow, and progressing the main story. The themes can get quite dark in the latter half of the game and your emotional boundaries will be tested during this portion of the game. It is not for the faint of heart. Some Easter eggs/ secrets/events are hidden in pretty obscure places and can be easily missed by first-time players. The game's meta elements are not as well hidden in this game as the original. At this point, I'm kind of nitpicking.\n\nIf you haven't experienced this game yet and are okay with disturbing content, then give this game a go.\n\n7.5 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1670957437, "timestamp_updated": 1670957437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128498178": {"recommendationid": "128498178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128729976", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1671899268}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Deep Poems\" make me courage enough to Load and Play This (after I buy so long Time)\n", "timestamp_created": 1670954135, "timestamp_updated": 1670954135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128467380": {"recommendationid": "128467380", "author": {"steamid": "76561199047496498", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1670911350}, "language": "english", "review": "natsuki best girl", "timestamp_created": 1670909115, "timestamp_updated": 1670909115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128466479": {"recommendationid": "128466479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213366305", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1670906984}, "language": "english", "review": "im glad i was able to pay for a game that meant a lot to me when i was a little younger. i had fun replaying the game and getting the full ending even if it was a little tedious. some of the stuff i did to get 100% data collection was more than a little tedious, especially the ghost menu, fuck the ghost menu. the side stories were okay, the music was great and theyre a good idea conceptually. The real issue was that they were extremely blunt with their messaging. the original ddlc wasn't exactly subtle either but it did let you at least figure some of the stuff out on your own.

If you are impatient and can't play a game more than once, this isn't for you since you have to play it multiple times to get all the extra side stories. If you want the standard DDLC experience, though, the main game is entirely free. I also do recommend you play the original before deciding to buy this one, as you play the main game multiple times to get more content in this version. \n\nMy honest reaction to that information:\n\nI love DDLC+, if there's any new reason to play through DDLC again, this is definitely one of them. I remember being oblivious to the deep stuff behind it and thinking it was one of those one-off VNs meant to attract an audience to get them to buy the other games. Oh boy, was I wrong. This game probably sparked my interest in storytelling beyond the more traditional medians. This game goes beyond how a game can tell a story and lore to the point that you literally go through the game's files to progress it. (Sidenote this particular one has you enter into a fake PC so you don't actually mess with the real files. Check out the original one for more of that stuff.) (Side-sidenote I'll go more into detail about the main game when I write my review on the original one (IF I write one, anyways lol))\n\nThe real meat of this game is the side stories, though. I loved the side stories, even though I'm not a huge characters guy anymore. Each one of the stories takes two of the main characters and builds their relationship with each other while also going into depth upon the founding of the literature club. The amount of references they make to the main game is a very nice touch because the side stories (supposedly) take place before the main game which ties together the characters for when the main game takes place.\n\nIf you've played DDLC a couple times and are willing to do it all over again to go even deeper, this game is definitely worth the investment.\n\nMight remove this review later if I wake up one day and cringe at what I wrote here.", "timestamp_created": 1670723975, "timestamp_updated": 1670723975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score":

down again.. \nHonestly, the story was so good the horror made me more mad that all the characters had such a sad ending.\n\nSome may have severe depression or anxiety or a bad home life, this game covers these in a much more exciting and serious way than those mental health ads on YouTube. \n\nI do think the addition of side stories in the plus version helps quench my thirst for a more fulfilling story and it really does reveal a lot about the characters, it still doesn't cover everything I'd like.\n\nDan Salvato put in a lot of work into the story telling, and looking at the base game more than the average player can really put a lot into perspective, as I've said before, it has a lot of mental health related topics and Natsuki is obviously bullied and made fun of by everyone around her and she as a character I think was made to symbolise the bullies at Dan's school when he was younger.\n\nHe liked Nintendo games but the other kids were more into COD etc.\n\nWell, enough ranting, I'll save that for a YouTube video\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1669546594, "timestamp_updated": 1669546594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,
