it takes a certain kind of gamer to really like this admittedly. its a lot of wandering, a lot of looking for symbolism or trying to peice some story together, some story that the game really isnt actually trying much to make. but in a way thats the beauty of it, at least to me. the gameplay consists of effectively walking around, very occasionally grabbing a new item, and just kinda seeing the worlds. having an experience. its more an experiece than an honest game. i find myself respecting a lot of media like that so my opinion is likely biased. you could use the game to relax, to pass the time, or just to see if you could draw meaning out of it. the game is about exploring your dreams after all. arent we all trying to understand our own dreams? thats what its about.",

All you do in this game is explore these vast stretches of creepy emptiness that loop endlessly. You don't gain or learn anything from the experience, and you give up trying to make sense of it. The music also loops endlessly, so you just become lost in these uncomfortable dark places. And yet, there is comfort. Comfort in the fact that you can't ever \"lose\" in Yume Nikki, and that you can immediately escape any dream world if it becomes too oppressive. That is the true nastiness of depression, that it becomes seductive in its \"safe\" darkness and loneliness, and you can forget there was ever any other way of existing.

There ins't action, or gunfire, or anything like that. But it is still really fun to play and look around.\n\nThe game is also kind of a trip, so if that is not your thing then steer clear. It is very old school 16 bit type feel, so if that is not your thing...this game won't change your mind. And it isn't something you will probably sit down and play for hours.

That said, between the art, the worlds, the music, the characters, I've found no other game that can replicate the absurdity of a dream better than this one.\n\nYou could spend time interpreting the dreams (in the same way your own dreams might be inspired by the real world), and I DO like certain theories that have floated around the internet about the meaning behind these dreams... but who's to say about any of that?\n\nThere IS an official ending to the game, so this is something you CAN \"complete\", but you are almost guaranteed to need a walkthrough. That doesn't include all of the optional events and interactions you might come across. There are a couple of locations and events in this game that genuinely terrified me or made me feel a certain type of way.\n\nOne more thing: The game starts slow and the default walking speed is likely too slow for most people. Luckily, there is an effect in the game that grants you a faster traveling speed and is something I recommend finding when you can. But if you want to play Yume Nikki: X-TREME MODE, then go right ahead and just walk the entire time, I dare you.\n\nIn short, this is a good game to play late at night and is the best video game representation I've seen of what the world of dreams can be like, but it's not for everyone.

I would recommend just starting to play the game rather than looking around too much. By playing the game, you will know what it's all about. This game would've been slightly better for me had I not looked around slightly too much.\n\nActual Review:\nActual fever dreams I tell you, in a really good way. I'd highly recommend this game to the adventurous type who also likes mysteries, theorizing, psychology, and diving into more mentally disturbing topics. It'd be hard to explain in a review, but imagine a mentally destroyed beyond repaired Japanese girl's nightmares that reflect her life as something you explore in a video game. And bam, you have Yume Nikki.\n\nAs soon as I entered my first door, Forest World, and traversed the inner dream worlds, I knew I was in for an extremely wild ride that hits close to home with how dreams feel, because there is literally no determining where you'll be next, yet everything seems to naturally just make sense over time. I encourage you not to use a wiki for the effects until you've explored every world and inner world you know of. I emphasize the exploration aspect of this game. There's a lot of crazy stuff in this game, some that you likely will not even see if you go for just beating the game.\n\nFurthermore, this game inspired the creation of other video games that follow a similar premise of setting an atmosphere and aesthetics, such as Doki Doki Literature Club, Undertale, OMORI, and probably many more well known video games that hit you in the feels in this very bizarre way that I probably wouldn't be able to explain very well. Feel free to do your own research. ;)\n\nIf all this sounds like something you like, please go ahead and play Yume Nikki. :D\n\n\nWarning (of Salt): If you make it to White Desert B in the extremely convoluted way, do not take the tunnel exit immediately. That exit is a one-way exit to White Desert A, so only leave when you're done. Take everything in as what you have done is not all that easy.

Along with having a minimalist soundtrack (most songs being a couple notes long) that helps to establish an atmosphere that feels like walking through ones' dreams.\n\nThis game is very much akin to its predecessor, LSD Dream Emulator, whereas the game is not something you play to win or complete but rather to experience, kinda like looking at a painting.\n\nFor anyone hoping to start the game, I heavily encourage not playing just to get all the effects and get to the ending, but to rather to simply explore and enjoy the visuals and events present through the game.\n\nIf you are looking for a game where the goal is to complete and go through the story to end, then you may want to check out the 2018 remake of Yume Nikki, Yume Nikki: Dream Diary.

It didn't take me too long to realize the game's environments were way too vast for me to attempt exploring on my own while keeping my sanity, so I found a walkthrough to take me through the Effects so I could see the game's conclusion.\nBefore playing, I read a primer for new players which said that there was no 'winning' or 'losing' Yume Nikki, and I think they were right. I've gotten into some experimental games, but personally I think this required a bit too much time and patience with too little direction for me to appreciate.

In the game you play as a girl whose name is 'Madotsuki'. After she goes to sleep you follow along on her journey through a lot of weird worlds and locations in her dreams. You will meet a lot of strange characters and in each world you can collect different items/effects such as umbrellas, Knives and anything in between by interacting with things or creatures. The game contains some horror elements and a massive amount of creativity and weirdness. \n\nThe game is a walking and exploration RPG Maker game that takes about 5-6 hours per run (atleast thats how much time it took me, maybe I am just incredibly slow). However, the game does not contain any jumpscares, but some fun and creepy locations. The game is not having any specific plot and you can't communicate with any of the characters in a way of speech. The game is free as well and has an INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK. I can recommend this game to anyone, who likes creepy, atmospheric and creative games and it is also a good start for those, who want to start playing this kinda genre. \n\nOne in all: Great game, good Soundtrack, Incredible Locations/Characters.\nDefinentaly recommend!!\n\n(Sorry for my english, I am still learning the language) \n", "timestamp_created": 1684089769, "timestamp_updated": 1684089769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632840394973754883", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138277360": {"recommendationid": "138277360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201234681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1684047426}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay loop is simple. You explore the areas and are awarded effects for your troubles. The catch is some paths are one ways to certain places.

Making a mental map, remembering where I have and haven't been, and incorporating a little bit of problem solving. There's something really rewarding and even addicting about discovering new areas, finding new effects, or even just cool landmarks. But I don't think I would find it so fun or intriguing if the art and atmosphere weren't amazing. Art's a preference thing, so I know this style won't jive with everybody.

So this game is pretty much a dream come true for me. Another thing I love about this game is how the story is pretty much entirely left up to your interpretation. I'm a huge sucker for stuff like that, and I've had a great time coming up with theories/headcanons for this game. The music is lovely, and it's very exciting to discover new places, effects, events, etc. Not even to mention the horror aspect of the game.

"playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1682982453}, "language": "english", "review": "A very influential game that's worth watching videos about and analyzing, but not worth to play through. Whenever I think of rpg maker games that resonated with me, there was a gameplay that I found somewhat lacking, but a very interesting narrative that saves it. So it's all the weirder to me that yume nikki doesn't seem to get criticized for throwing both elements into the trashcan.\n\nThe gameplay is about exploring very vibrant and different dream worlds, almost all of them interconnected into a pretty cool web, if you check world map for it online, you can really appreciate the craft of it, some of the places are only accessible using specific item, so there is slight puzzle element to it too. But that's kinda it, the levels often have no interesting structure, most of the starter ones have the same concept of a dark background, sprites thrown all over it, and then all 4 borders looping the stage, the magic of such location quickly fades when you realize how little they have going for them besides the \"vibe\". Some levels are just labirynths with a single tileset, also quickly growing monotone. The more structured deep dreams finally start scratching that funny little thing called \"sense of discovery\", but the ratio of dull to interesting just isn't good enough, there is no dialogues to add to it, music is extremely short loops, and there is some unexpected image popping out at your screen every once in a while. The game appears designed to starve you for meaningful interactions, and that's precisely why some easter eggs (especially a horror one) impacted the players so much.\nNaturally as there is no narrative (besides the implications of Madotsuki being a traumatized neet about to call it quits), you simply observe the variety of spritework and interpret your own meaning for them, trying to come up with more detailed backstory for the protag, as well as general symbolism for real life, that the game might be trying to do. I like wacky dreams just like the next guy, there is some subconcious art in them, but at the end it's just abstractions without anything profound to say.\n\nThe game is an experiment from all the way back in 2004, on how much of a \"game\" can you strip away from something, before people start calling it a \"more of an experience\". I am not even all that surprised about the huge amount of fan games, as all it takes to make a \"world\" is a single small size tileset, sprinkle sprites around, add 4 second music loop, and some doors to other worlds, and you're good to go. As long as you create an interesting atmosphere, that's all that matters for a dream diary, which is a shame, since some of these toppings are really interesting and leave me hungry for more, but they will never make a full cake.", "timestamp_created": 1683017895, "timestamp_updated": 1683018351, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513873815536499023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137662144": {"recommendationid": "137662144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140503462", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 489, "last_played": 1683148227}, "language": "english", "review": "95% of the game is just walking.", "timestamp_created": 1683008986, "timestamp_updated": 1683008986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137655906": {"recommendationid": "137655906", "author": {"steamid": "76561199469448008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1683062812}, "language": "spanish", "review": "un clasicaso de primera, muy recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1682996201, "timestamp_updated": 1682996201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137655149": {"recommendationid": "137655149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057158858", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1655060066}, "language": "english", "review": "Yume Nikki and its surrounding fandom (\"fandom\" by which I especially mean inspired works of art) are products of a subculture of a subculture -- a specific time and place in the 2000s.

version:\nIt's a game for a niche crowd, but that niche crowd will adore it like few other things. Even those who dislike walking simulators and the like, will almost definitely still love the artistry. (Great soundtrack, creative visuals and characters, etc). It's not perfect, but the positives outweigh the flaws.\n\nLong version:\nSo, artistically, this game very clearly takes a ton of inspiration from LSD Dream Emulator. If you like that game and also like the 2D overhead style, you will love this, guaranteed. It's a walking simulator themed around strange environments. Some are more normal (Dense Woods, Snow World), while others are more surreal (Windmill World, White Desert). There are quite a few visual similarities. For example a lot of the more psychedelic things remind of LSD's \"downer texture\". Number World is like the \"kanji texture\". But this is still clearly its own game. \n\nIt is a bit more \"involved\" than LSD, but not by much. You collect effects which either change Madotski's appearance, or give her powers. You can kill NPCs but this is optional. You collect money by doing that, but the money only buys vending machine drinks which are also optional. The main focus is very clearly exploration. The audience for something like this is very niche, but for that niche crowd, this game ticks basically every box you could ever ask for. Tons of variation, tons of exploration, tons of weirdness, tons of darkness and light, very isolating, and tons of atmosphere. Horror elements alongside cuter elements. The soundtrack is varied, too. Most songs are short loops, but they don't feel \"repetitive\". These loops can be anything from electronic music, to ambient droning, to piano, and so on. \n\nThe game isn't perfect. The most common complaint by far is that it's so difficult to figure things out without a guide. None of it is [i]intrinsic[/i] to enjoying the game - you don't need a guide to just walk around and experience the world, after all. But if you want to see the full potential of the game, a guide is basically required. Also, navigation can be... slow. The bicycle effect is essential to move faster. Also, the \"Hand Eye\" effect can teleport you back to the hub area. Without these, the game will be much more tedious. A gripe that's perhaps more personal, lies in the game's overall mood. A melancholy mood pervades the entire game. Even happy areas have this air of either fake happiness, or a temporary happiness soon to be ripped away. [spoiler]The game ends with Madotsuki killing herself[/spoiler] and the whole game sort of feels like a psychedelic precursor to that. LSD lacked this melancholy feeling, instead emphasizing the weirdness and the horror. Whether the depressive elements are a good addition or not, is totally subjective. But to me personally, it does weigh down my experience a little bit. Regardless, it is still an extremely enjoyable game in spite of these few flaws. If you like the idea of surreal walking simulators, your options are limited, as far as I know.

Niveles abstractos con objetivos medio abstractos.\n\nLos niveles est\u00e1n buenos en su mayor\u00eda, hay alguna u otra cosa que hacer, aunque casi siempre son solo simples pasajes para llegar a otro nivel que funge como una \"estaci\u00f3n\" a donde te lleva a X o Y nivel.\n\nDependiendo del nivel, la m\u00fasica esta buena, osea acompa\u00f1a y es relajante, en otros casos parece un poco incomoda o \"tenebrosa\".\n\nEn general los powerups o habilidades est\u00e1n bien, varios son de un uso especifico pero est\u00e1n buenos y siempre da algo de alegr\u00eda saber que ahora vas a poder llegar a un lugar que antes no pod\u00edas(ahora toca averiguar a cual), aunque claro, este no es un juego que destaque por su jugabilidad, le tiro flores a los powerups pero solo porque en la medida de que el juego es simple, sus powerups tambi\u00e9n lo son.\n\nOtra cosa positiva del juego es que pr\u00e1cticamente podes elegir a donde ir, obvio que en varias Zonas vas a necesitar X o Y powerup pero se nota ese libre albedr\u00edo que te dan al principio.\n\nDir\u00eda que lo malo del juego es que es ultra cr\u00edptico(mas que el Zelda 1) y no vas a saber a donde ir ni que hacer... en parte eso ayuda a la experiencia on\u00edrica y de estar en un mundo de sue\u00f1os donde no tenes ni idea que chota pasa pero jugablemente hablando, si te mandas as\u00ed nomas creo que ni te vas a pasar el juego. Quiz\u00e1s esto se solucionaba que se yo \u00bfcon alg\u00fan logro de steam que te diga MAS O MENOS que deber\u00edas hacer o donde ir para tener una pista? digo porque por ejemplo, ya que el juego no te explica nada en concreto, a mi me costo darme cuenta de como era la mec\u00e1nica para despertarte y volver a tu habitaci\u00f3n(cosa que es algo recurrente y fundamental en el recorrido).\n\nPor \u00faltimo, me gustar\u00eda decir que por no saber exactamente que hacer o a donde ir, en caso de que te logres pasar el juego, lo mas probable es que te hayas dejado como 20 zonas que solo tienen el prop\u00f3sito de mostrarte \"algo y ya est\u00e1\" como si fuera un \"evento\" o \"premio visual\" como por ejemplo, cuando haces que te aparezca la cara esa tipo Screamer. De estos secretos el juego tiene muchos, aunque no son coleccionables si fungen como tal. Repito esto se solucionar\u00eda con buenos logros de Steam, porque sino, es 100% seguro de que o pierdas el inter\u00e9s de seguir jugando por decir \"Na ya est\u00e1, con lo que me costo pasarme el juego, no tengo ganas de seguir explorando por si me falto algo\"(Y lo mas probable es que si te falten ver muchas cosas) o que directamente te atasques en una parte y est\u00e9s pr\u00e1cticamente obligado a buscarte una gu\u00eda.\n\nEn fin, el juego te ofrece una experiencia bastante \u00fanica, aunque realmente dudo que la disfrutes al 100% sin usar una gu\u00eda, una l\u00e1stima porque el juego es bastante corto pero bueno, al menos est\u00e1 gratis.\n\nPD: \u00a1AGUANTE THE DOCKS! tanto en dise\u00f1o como en m\u00fasica ese nivel se zarpa en on\u00edrico y relajante.", "timestamp_created": 1678746508, "timestamp_updated": 1678747515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134619371": {"recommendationid": "134619371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044045700", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1678741973}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game, Gameplaywise can be a bit annoying to find the effect which is why I decided to look them up on the net.

I came into this game completely blind (a joke video had popped up on my recommended while I was binge watching Battle Block Theatre) and once I saw it was a free game I decided to try it out and see if I could get any inspiration for my own creative stuff - plus I'm incredibly interested in RPGMaker games but I haven't played many of them which kind of annoys me. \n\nBest decision I've ever made, hands down. I had to get some help with the final few effects through guides and a video but overall 10/10 made me attached and then made me cry.", "timestamp_created": 1677883378, "timestamp_updated": 1677883378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133972751": {"recommendationid": "133972751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240142816", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1677451982}, "language": "english", "review": "Kikiyama's classic Yume Nikki is still worth experiencing in 2023\n\nI say experience because Yume Nikki isn't a game you play. It's a world you get lost in consumed by sounds and sights unlike anything you or me have ever seen.\nIn a time now where games have become more about appearing like blockbuster movies you interact with and spend most of that time watching hours of cutscenes just to nake you care, Yume Nikki does this instantly without saying a single word.\n\nThere's something extremely psychological about this game that falls into a few others that just carry this unique ambiance that will leave an impression on you much like getting a beer from your fridge. You might not want to take a sip everyday, maybe not even for weeks or months. But it will always be there when you fancy getting a light buzz.\n\nYume Nikki is a comfort game to some, maybe even an unsettling visual mess to others, or just boring to some. What you get out of this isn't an objective or a goal. It's about the journey and letting yourself get lost in this strange, abstract, lonesome, disconnected world that will make you feel as much as you put into it. So give it your time and your attention.

The game gave off an overall theme of death in my opinion with much of its visuals, interestingly choosing to do this most overtly with a sort of what I assume to be an Aztec art style in some of the more easily accessible locations. Although I believe that death and a sort of gloomy atmosphere of loneliness hangs over much of this game\u2019s environments, I mostly felt a sense of eagerness for exploration to see what I might find next from various interactions in the unique world the game presents.\n\nPart of my motivation for playing this somewhat niche game was having played games like Omori, Quantum Eternity, and 21 The World. The inspiration from this game I believe can be felt in all these what you might call derivative works to varying degrees. I highly recommend checking out the previously mentioned games if you haven\u2019t already. \n\nWhile the game does have an \u201cend goal\u201d it is not the focus of the game, and this goal may not even be immediately apparent as you explore the diverse scenery of the dream worlds your character traverses. The only form of in progression in this game, aside from exploration, is collecting \u201ceffects\u201d by interacting with some parts of environments. Effects are a sort of cosmetic collectable that the player can apply to themselves, however, not all these effects are purely cosmetic. Some effects grant the ability interact with some environments in a different way than having no effect equipped, two examples of effects that are not wholly cosmetic would be the stoplight and the bicycle. Using the stoplight allows the player to halt certain aspects of the environment that they are in, and the bicycle allows the player to move faster, which is quite important as some locations are rather large. In total there are 24 effects for the player to find throughout their journey. Personally, I was only able to find 20/24 effects before I had to look up a guide on how to find the rest as some of them are a little cryptic to obtain blind.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game as it provides an interesting experience that doesn\u2019t require a large time investment to see something interesting or intriguing. Although the game does have an ending, I do not believe that the player should be incredibly stressed to reach this ending as much of the enjoyment for me at least came from exploring the environment. If you do have trouble collecting all effects to reach the ending, I would recommend looking up a guide to help finish off the effects collection.\n", "timestamp_created": 1677818137,

in which you have to explore various dream worlds that consist of varied themes. It's a rather simple game, but it manages to be incredibly unique and interesting nonetheless, as shown by its ability to spawn several fanmade works and be referenced through countless indie titles. \n\nThe actual exploration of the game is generally what I would consider easy, you simply walk around and take in the atmosphere usually without fear of danger (there are very slight occasions you may need to escape an enemy). Your goal is to collect various \"effects\" hidden through the dream worlds, and for most of them, it is rather simple to do since finding them is the only true challenge. There are about two effects that might prove challenging to find, but all the others are mostly found in reasonable places to discover naturally. Along the way are plenty of intriguing sights to see, while some of them might be quite unsettling it all comes together to make a lovely artistic style.\n\nAs far as complaints go, my only one really revolves around the fact that your movement speed is pretty low. This can lead to the exploration aspect being a bit of a drag if you start needing to revisit locations. The game does have a counter to this, however, which is the inclusion of a Bicycle effect that doubles your speed; I would highly recommend finding this with a guide if you start to dislike the slow walking since it makes that problem null. \n\nOverall, Yume Nikki certainly lived up to its reputation in my eyes and made me once again find the enjoyment of exploration that games like Outer Wilds had to offer. I look forward to trying out some fanmade games of this, it's certainly a formula that works exceptionally well. \n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1676801390, "timestamp_updated": 1676801390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133153724": {"recommendationid": "133153724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069269282", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1633772045}, "language": "english", "review": "yippie ! yippie!!! wheee yippie yippie :3", "timestamp_created": 1676789334, "timestamp_updated": 1676789334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133152637": {"recommendationid": "133152637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308096612", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1676787598}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this while high and it was pretty whack", "timestamp_created": 1676787638, "timestamp_updated": 1676787638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133145123": {"recommendationid": "133145123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314823771", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1676956711}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful and haunting, Yume Nikki is a silent masterpiece.

I still played this knowing that it was meant to be more of a thought-provoking, artistic piece but it was excruciatingly boring, unimaginative, purposeless, and infuriating. There is no point to any construct or ability in the game. You're 'meant' to just go around looking for random items that do absolutely nothing and serve little to no effect (ha ha) on anything that can be construed as progress. It might have been a little more worth playing if the music was good or if the art was anything other than blob-with-a-mouth. Yume Nikki pretends to be a game, for example you can get money which can get lives which do nothing whatsoever because you can't even die in the game since there are no enemies. There's no dialogue and all you do is walk into endless looping rooms until you find some random NPC to give you poop hair (which also does nothing but the flies were funny ig). After 5 hours of play-through I just gave up, uninstalled the game, and watched the ending which is so incredibly stupid.\n\nThe fans of this game love coming up with theories and interpretations. Good for them I guess, but I can't help thinking that they're putting meaning to something that doesn't even exist. If that's your thing then go ahead. But honestly this game is a waste of time. It may have saved some people's lives(??) but the only way it will save my life is when it's gone from my PC entirely.

Yume Nikki is a surreal walking simulator that has you explore your characters (very spooky) lucid dreams. You collect \"effects\" which alter your appearance or give you unique abilities.

Knowing how much I enjoyed OMORI, I decided to give this game a shot.\n\nYume Nikki isn't like any game I've played before. It revolves around pure exploration, with nothing being told directly to you since there is no dialogue. The only time anything was explained was the tutorial, but it didn't explain all the possible actions. The gameplay consist of going to sleep to enter the dream world and picking areas to go explore. As you explore, you find effects that can alter the gameplay.  \n\nThere is a lot to explore, with some areas accessible only through events with chance, so looking things up seems necessary at times since you wouldn't know to do something a certain way. I would advise waiting until you've explored almost everything before committing to looking anything up, but that's just a recommendation. There is an ending to the game, but I also needed to look up how to do that.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the gameplay a lot. It was refreshing to have a game solely based off exploration, but it did lead to confusion at times. I also could feel the inspiration OMORI had while I was playing this game. The overarching concepts were the same, but the gameplay and presentation were very different. I would definitely recommend this game, but with the catch of being prepared to look things up since it's near impossible to assume a 1/64 chance for some events.", "timestamp_created": 1671032743, "timestamp_updated": 1671032743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128523698": {"recommendationid": "128523698", "author": {"steamid": "76561199277752677", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1380, "last_played": 1671399441}, "language": "english", "review": "definitely a fun game if you have the patience for it. i'v ran into a few glitches before but if you just close and re open the game it should be fine. its good but probably not for everybody.", "timestamp_created": 1670989650, "timestamp_updated": 1670989650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128520718": {"recommendationid": "128520718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106947117", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1521219960}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic RPG Maker game that inspired so many more.

I think the dreams portray what the girl is feeling with the creepiness, with some symbolism of the end on stairs, the creepy ladies that I thought to be an abusive mother from trauma. This game says very little and put everything up to the audience's interpretation, which is amazingly genius that this very simple old game can resonate with so many people and be popular in the world of 4k graphics and triple A titles.\n\nOverall, it's a masterpiece to me and the art and community is amazing for this niche game.

Don't know if it real human or not since she was dreaming. All you need to do is collecting stuff or i mentioned as cosmetics. Madotsuki will wear it to get through in some location which need the cosmetic ability. Not all can be use, there is also just a cosmetic for Madotsuki. Basically, this game is exploration RPG. You just wander around, find some stuff, then collect it and you will see the ending.

It's extremely weird, surreal, and a lot of times just straight creepy, with strange imagery and artwork, unsettling music, and weird random events that you sometimes come across. \n\nTo my 2022 Gamer(TM) self, I find it a decent bit boring, as a lot of the exploration, which is 99.99% of this game's \"gameplay\", can become very tedious and grating since your character is so slow (until you get a bike in a random area, but even then it can drag). This also is compounded by the fact that many areas are found numerous layers into one of Yume Nikki's main hub world doors, and are connected in maze-like ways that make very little sense if not none at all, which can make exploration more irritating. You find little abilities here and there which are used in certain obtuse puzzles or secrets, but that makes up a small portion of what you do in total. With this in mind, though, please understand: \n\n***This is not a game in the literal sense. It is more an avant-garde A/V experience, so do not play this expecting riveting gameplay, a fantastic story, or constant events/action. It is less something to play and more something to just look at or listen to. It is completely okay to want more than that, but do not be surprised if you do and when you play Yume Nikki, you get bored like I did. Do not make my mistake.***\n\nIf you want to experience weird imagery, strange music and audio, and one of the inspirations for many RPGs to come in its future, by all means, play Yume Nikki: After all, it's free.

Technically, this is my second time trying to play this game. The first time I got super lost and gave up. If you are trying to complete the game without help like I did, most of the game was writing down notes and drawing maps so that I knew where I was actually going. I spent several hours trying to find everything in a certain red labyrinth (Ill admit that most of that time was spent taking screenshots and putting them together). This could be a good or bad thing but their isn't any obvious story laid out for you. There isn't any dialog so you try to figure out what is going on by examining the environment. Artistically, this game goes above any other pixel graphic game that I have played. It plays around with perspectives and art styles to make unique and interesting environments to explore. This game can be a little scary and overwhelming at times, but I really love it! The music is mostly repeating tracts that are 5-10 seconds long but they really add more into the game and enjoyed it.\n\nI really liked Yume Nikki.

Nunca sabr\u00e1s nada m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de estas instrucciones  iniciales del juego.\n\nNo sabr\u00e1s nunca quien es la protagonista. Ni que ve en sus sue\u00f1os. Si son cosas aleatorias o representaciones de alg\u00fan trauma o algo con un m\u00ednimo de sentido.\n\nA\u00fan as\u00ed, este juego tiene una wiki con todo tipo de informaci\u00f3n. Desde los NPC decorativos de cada escenario, hasta las posibles teor\u00edas que han dado los jugadores.\n\n\n\nPor eso digo que este juego fue adelantado a su tiempo.\n\nAntes de Limbo, Inside, Little Nightmares y todos estos juegos de terror carentes de historia o prop\u00f3sito, pero que dejan muchas inc\u00f3gnitas haciendo que la gente se interese por ellas por querer averiguar acerca de su trasfondo, investigando a los diferentes personajes, lugares y toda clase de elementos que pudieran dar l\u00f3gica a un universo que no tiene sentido, Yume Nikki ya lo ten\u00eda todo!\n\nY es que, si bien esto lo vemos hoy como lo m\u00e1s normal del mundo, sobretodo en este tipo de juegos, en su momento esto fue un antes y un despu\u00e9s en el mundo de los videojuegos.\n\n\n\n\nEn cuanto a la jugabilidad pues es simplemente un walking simulator donde debemos adentarnos en una barbaridad de escenarios a cada cual m\u00e1s terror\u00edfico que el anterior.\n\nY no, no son 12 mundos en total (las 12 puertas de la Sala de puertas), sino que hay muchos m\u00e1s mundos ocultos donde se conectan unos con otros y algunos solo son accesibles navegando por lugares muy espec\u00edficos y que son muy dif\u00edciles de encontrar, lo que los convierte en mundos profundos.\n\nMuchos mundos, al igual que NPC entre muchos otros elementos, son solo decorativos y no hacen avanzar el progreso del juego, pero ayudan a darle m\u00e1s vida al extra\u00f1o universo formado a trav\u00e9s de los sue\u00f1os de Madotsuki, lo que incita m\u00e1s a explorar todo.\n\n\n\n\nY antes de terminar con mi rese\u00f1a, quiero advertir de una cosa para quien nunca haya jugado a este juego y le de curiosidad probarlo (sobretodo porque es gratis).\n\nMira, Yume Nikki es una arma de doble filo: la mayor virtud de este juego es, a su vez, su peor defecto:\n\nY esto es que el juego NUNCA te dice nada m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las instrucciones iniciales.\n\n\nPor una parte esto es FANT\u00c1STICO porque le da esa aura de misterio que hace que uno piense: \u00bfQu\u00e9 tan profundo es este juego? \u00bfCuantos mundos hay? \u00bfQu\u00e9 cosas me voy a encontrar? \u00bfQu\u00e9 lo m\u00e1s horrible que voy a ver y d\u00f3nde est\u00e1?\n\nEsta ignorancia de que nunca sabes por donde estas, hasta donde puedes llegar y que te vas a encontrar pues genera una inquietud que hace que la experiencia d\u00e9 mucho miedo, sobretodo la primera vez que no sabes nada.\n\nY esto no hace que el juego sea vuelva dif\u00edcil. Si te pierdes, siempre puedes pulsar la tecla 9 para que Madotsuki se despierte y empieces desde el principio sin perder progreso.\n\n\n\nSin embargo, esto se acaba volviendo FRUSTRANTE. \n\nLlega un punto en el que ya no sabes que hacer y el juego no te dice como llegar al final.\n\nSabes que tiene un final, que es dejando los efectos en la Sala de puertas, pero no te dice cuantos efectos hay ni como usarlos.\n\nY si, los efectos pueden usarse con la tecla 1 despu\u00e9s de equiparlos desde el men\u00fa con la tecla ESC. \u00bfSabes cuando te dice esto el juego? NUNCA.\n\n\nAl principio es f\u00e1cil conseguir efectos porque solo has de buscar el elemento diferenciador del nivel (por ejemplo, llegas a un bosque que hay muchos arboles y dibujos pero solo ves una rana; esa rana te da un efecto).\n\nPero luego llega un punto en el que ya no sabes que hacer y te pasas viajando todo el rato en los mismos sitios buscando efectos y sin encontrar nada, lo que se pierde la sensaci\u00f3n de terror y se gana la sensaci\u00f3n de perder el tiempo.\n\nEl juego no da NI UNA SOLA PISTA y ni siquiera te dice cuantos efectos debes conseguir ni que hacer despu\u00e9s para ver el final.\nSpoiler: [spoiler]Son 24 efectos, sin contar las instrucciones. Cuando los dejas todos en la Sala de Puertas debes despertar con la tecla 9 y salir al balc\u00f3n[/spoiler]\n\n\nComo os digo, esto es una arma de doble filo porque por una parte se consigue una mejor sensaci\u00f3n de terror al principio, pero luego se pierde y empiezas a pensar que est\u00e1s perdiendo el tiempo.\n\nSoluci\u00f3n: Mirar la wiki del juego y usarla como gu\u00eda para poder acabarlo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn resumen:\n\nUn juego de terror psicol\u00f3gico muy bueno que sigue dando miedo en 2022 y lo seguir\u00e1 dando hasta el fin de los tiempos.\n\nYume Nikki es un juego muy recomendado para quien le guste este g\u00e9nero.\nLo que yo recomiendo es jugar con las luces apagadas, con los auriculares puestos y con el m\u00f3vil en silencio para tener la m\u00e1xima inmersi\u00f3n posible.\n\nSolo cuando ya no sepas que hacer y empieces a dar vueltas por los mundos recorriendo los mismos lugares buscando los \u00faltimos efectos que no encuentras, es cuando recomiendo que mires la wiki porque seguir buscando es una p\u00e9rdida de tiempo. Hay tantos secretos y tan bien escondidos, que ser\u00e1n casi imposibles de encontrar sin una gu\u00eda.\n\nSea como sea, disfruta de uno de los mejores juegos de terror jam\u00e1s hechos. No lo subestimes por su impopularidad o sus sencillos gr\u00e1ficos de 32 bits.\n\n\nGracias por su lectura.", "timestamp_created": 1665359696, "timestamp_updated": 1665527765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545141279697418213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123567742": {"recommendationid": "123567742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020882502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1657153121}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this years ago when it was a shareware videogame without a steam release. It's unchanged as far as I can tell from the original game. It works OK on newer PCs but due to the engine there are some compatibility problems with certain graphics cards. I believe the vignette effect can be quite slow depending on the hardware you're using.\n\nThe game itself is a long, winding exploration of the dreams of the main character, Madotsuki. The main loop consists of sleeping in your bed and, once asleep, leaving your apartment to explore the depths of your subconscious. The goal, if there is any, is to collect all of the \"effects\" in the game and view the ending. While there are a couple effects that have gameplay consequences (mainly the bike, which makes you go faster, and the knife, which allows you to kill NPCs in your dreams), the vast majority of effects are purely cosmetic. There are also many randomly triggered events and sights to see, ranging from beautiful to ugly, and from serene to terrifying. It's a game which is primarily based on exploration, seeing novel sights, and getting further into your dreams than you did the night before.\n\nI will say, however, that this game does not respect your time at all. If you don't know where to go, it can take forever to get your first effects. Without the bike, the game can feel like quite a slog. Some events trigger only very rarely and basically require you to repeatedly try to trigger them if you really want to see them for yourself. I recommend playing this game without a guide for the first few hours if you want the authentic, lost experience.

"english", "review": "I can see why this game has a huge cult following-even to this day in 2022! However, I do also understand where some people would have criticisms in terms of lack of direction for the game's narrative (or lack thereof one).\nI personally get overwhelmed when a game does not give me an objective in order to accomplish it to the fullest potential, so when a game like this just tells me to collect effects in order to get more of an experience playing the game-without much of direction to get some of those effects-this game can be a bit overwhelming. I wanted to really explore this like the game encourages me to, but when I can't interact with the larger majority of my surroundings, it becomes very taxing to explore with very little to no reward. So in order to keep myself sane, I had to lookup walkthroughs in order to get the majority of the things done here.\nDespite these criticisms-I do feel like this game is worth playing. Knowing that this game inspired many other games later down the road, I do see where a lot of people get the appeal of playing as a young girl wandering around in her dreams. There are some genuinely interesting, creepy, and unsettling imagery throughout, and with the help of walkthroughs, I was able to see and experience some things that I feel like games nowadays sort of overuse and oversaturate their content with. And I also feel like this is a game that can be worth playing for in terms of not completing the story all the way through to the ending. The ending... I'll say it was very sudden for what you would expect in terms of playing a game like this. But that doesn't stop you from going back into a save and exploring more with the effects you now possess. You're able to get into areas you couldn't before, as well as have particular events occur in the game that you may have not seen in your first time exploring certain areas and worlds.\nI recommend having an open mind for a game like this. Don't expect much of a story to this because that may disappoint a many of people who think stories are what make all games great. This game definitely explores a way to play without any expectation of a plot aside of a handful of indications of who they character you're playing as. Madotsuki is a girl who is homebound and escapes her reality to have a better life in her dreams. This ambiguity of the character makes you wonder of how a young child has these sorts of dreams with creepy places, strange monsters and other odd aspects occur for her in her mind. Why would the \"ending\" of the game occur for someone like her? Ultimately, it doesn't really matter about the past or potential future for this character. The purpose of the game is to do things presently and experience things as openly as possible.\nOverall, very interesting game worth playing at least once. :)", "timestamp_created": 1659322499,

kind of game. So why am I recommending it?\n\n[Minor Spoilers to Start of the Game]\n\nThis game will be EXTREMELY confusing to people who just see it in the store or who have heard of it before and decide to get it, which was what happened for me. Within 10-20 minutes, you will get \"stuck\", or at least what most would consider \"stuck\". You're going to get lost once you've explored for a bit, which is why I was forced to google thinking I was doing something was wrong.\nIn reality, this isn't an ordinary game, it's extremely original, and more of a surreal experience than a game. It's like a piece of abstract art that you're able to explore. I've heard that there is an ending, but I have no idea how to get to it whatsoever. This game seems really cool, but I'm more personally into games that are at least a bit more adventurous than this one, so I couldn't finish it.\n\nI truly recommend this game, because it seems like a game you'd either not care about at all, or love deeply and be super immersed. I wish I liked this game because it seems very interesting, but I couldn't beat it.

This game, classified as an independent game, is not well-known in the circle of ordinary gamers, but it is a rough and eye-catching rough stone in the field of fan games. \u200b\u200b\n\n The 0.00 version was launched in 2004, and then to the 0.10 final version in 2007, the \"Dream Diary\" developed on the basis of \"RPG Maker 2003\", all the art and music materials are independently handled by the author.  In the production cycle of more than three years, this work and its author appeared and disappeared silently, which gave a surprise to the fan game circle of the year, and left countless mysteries.  This diary, which records twelve dreams, is like reading comprehension without the correct answer, allowing players to freely imagine.  To this day, fans have left more than four thousand \"Very Positive\" comments for the STEAM version of \"Dream Diary\", but this \"praise\" have nothing to do with \"fun\". Not only is it not fun, it will make people feel depressed, bored, depressed, and even have an uncomfortable reaction in severe cases.  It is precisely because of this that the crown of \"Dream Diary\" only shines brightly in the field of small fan games.\n\n The player enters \"Dream Diary\", and the movable space is only one bedroom and one terrace.  A picture tube TV with an old game console, a desk with a diary, a bookshelf, a single bed, this is all about the world of waking up.  In the room lived a girl with double ponytails and drowsy eyes all the time. The girl never spoke and had nothing to do except play game consoles and swivel chairs in the room.  There is a door on the upper left of the room, and no one knows what is on the other side of the door.  When the player investigates the door, the girl will only shake her head and refuse, not knowing whether she can't go out or doesn't want to go out.  So bored, the girl had no choice but to sleep with her head down.  Entering the dream, the girl actually stood on the terrace outside the house.  The sky turned dark, and an uncomfortable BGM sounded.  Back in the house, the game console was gone.  Investigated the door again, and actually opened it in a dream.  After opening the door in the dream, the player finally entered the game world of \"Dream Diary\".\n\n Doors, slightly spiritually polluted paintings.  More than a dozen doors with different shapes look at different dream worlds.  Each world is almost completely different, and ordinary natural scenery is not uncommon, but many worlds can make players spontaneously fall into unpleasant emotions.  The art style of individual levels is influenced by the Paracas civilization, with bright but extreme color matching, strangely shaped model units, and disturbing background music that has no melody at all, polluting it almost all the time.  player's heart.\n\n Even in levels that don't look so bad, there's still no gameplay to speak of.  \"Dream Diary\" has no teaching or guidance, and there is no text in the entire game.  The player entered dozens of huge dream realms out of thin air, scurrying around like a brainless fly.  The infinite loop map, the props that can only be found by continuous trial and error, finally found the NPC, and it was only found.\n\n Fans of the game began to question, \"Dream Diary\" is not like a normal person can do it.  Its visual and auditory double pollution is so serious that it can make some players feel physically uncomfortable, so that it is labeled as \"spiritual curiosity\".  People began to suspect that the low-key and introverted author, \u304d\u304d\u3084\u307e, who developed the game independently, may suffer from some mental illness.  He may be like a girl, staying behind closed doors, suffering from autism, depression and other diseases, and \"Dream Diary\" is a world that concretizes the dreams in the patient's brain.\n\nThose players who stayed in the world of \"Dream Diary\" gradually found the game's strategy.  Each world has hidden props, and the purpose of the game is to collect props with various prerequisites and put them at the entrance of the dream.  Interestingly, whenever a girl uses a prop, there will be some corresponding changes, such as changing her appearance, stepping on a bicycle, taking a kitchen knife, etc.  The corresponding changes of these props can also trigger the interaction of the few NPCs in the game.\n\n Of course, all these conjectures about \"Dream Diary\" have not been answered by the author \u304d\u304d\u3084\u307e.  The divergent space of \"Dream Diary\" has become larger and larger, allowing more and more foreign players to come into contact with this magical and strange fan game.  \"Dream Diary\" does not require any translation except the game menu, which is why players around the world feel the game world of \u304d\u304d\u3084\u307e without any difference.  The brain hole creation boom triggered in Japan has also continued to be staged overseas, and the process has intensified. For a time, \"a fan game developed based on the fan game \"Dream Diary\" appeared.\n\n \"Dream Diary\" has not been a big hit, but it has become a wonderful personal show for players.  We don't know what happened and what happened to the girls in \"Dream Diary\", but everyone has their own opinions and ideas about the game.  \"Dream Diary\" prompts players to constantly explore this unfriendly world, but also makes people think deeply about the spiritual world of individual groups.  After \"Dream Diary\", its shadow can occasionally be seen in fan games, and the well-respected \"Under the Legend\" seems to be influenced by it, and some easter eggs that look like it are arranged, which triggers players' secondary creation.  .  However, no one has been able to make a work as terminally ill as \"Dream Diary\".\n\n At the end of the story, the girl met all the friends in the dream world and collected all the props.  However, dreams are dreams after all, pinching his cheeks to wake up, even if they left them in the diary, the bedroom door still could not be opened.  Only the stairs to the sky on the terrace are waiting for you and her.", "timestamp_created": 1657431350, "timestamp_updated": 1680150436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576418280601501465", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118544272": {"recommendationid": "118544272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965099767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1657416393}, "language": "english", "review": "couldnt really understand how to play for the first hour.. eventually had to look up a guide. but it was very worth it! if you like games like omori or ib, you will most likely enjoy this game. :)", "timestamp_created": 1657416543, "timestamp_updated": 1657416543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118539459": {"recommendationid": "118539459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198862820611", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 89, "last_played": 1657410207}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect game to play and relax your mind to while also weird things go on around your character in the dream world lol.

potentially very symbolic, and things don't make a lot of sense at face value. there's still probably a lot about this game that's a mystery to me, but that's the fun of it. of all the voiceless protagonists, madotsuki is probably the cutest but also one of the most tragic. love this game and recommend it to anyone who likes odd, mysterious games with cryptic, unsettling, or intriguing

I just want to say this, I have no nostalgia or knowledge of Yumi Nikki prior to this point. I lived under a rock and never played this game and while I knew what it was about, I had no knowledge of the games contents. That being said, this game is a god damn masterpiece and it deserves all of the hype and praise it receives. \n\nI went into this with high expectations and it somehow met them. I understand that many players find this game incredibly boring, and while I disagree I do see their point. I personally see this game as more of an experience, not really a game. It is mostly about exploring the world of Madotsuki's dreams; Madotsuki being a hikkiomori who escapes her small room through her dreams using the Nexus. The Nexus is the games hub, a large room filled with 12 different doors. Each door takes Madotsuki to a different dream world. Exploring these dream worlds take you to smaller dream worlds which can connect you to the other bigger dream worlds. The goal of the game is to collect all 24 'effects'. Each effect changes Madotsuki's appearance and gives her a small thing she can do. You can find them in the dream worlds scattered around, either by interacting with NPC's or certain elements of the level. Beating the game requires you to drop all 24 effects into the Nexus, therefore completing the dream diary. However, the main appeal of the game is not the effects in my opinion. The reason I love this game is because it can tell you an intresting yet sad story with no dialogue and only through visuals, the ending and the contents of Madotsuki's dreams. Many of the seemingly random aspects of the game have a hidden meaning, and since the creator has kept their mouth shut on any fan theory's surrounding the game everything about it is truly left up to your own interpretation. This is easily the best part of Yumi Nikki, piecing together your own story based on the most random and horrific visuals Madotsuki's dreams have to offer. And believe me, many of the popular fan theory's surrounding this game are incredibly dark and may be uncomfortable for some people. Some conclusions you can come to may be standard struggles or insecurities many people have to deal with, or extremely taboo and sensitive topics. I cannot mention the most popular theory about this game for obvious reasons and although it has a lot of merit to it, I  personally do not think it is the sole reason Madotsuki is like this. I believe that it isn't the main reason, but rather a major component to how she ended up this way.\n\nOverall I think this game is spectacular and I honestly am kind of mad at myself for not playing it a lot sooner. There is literally no reason to not try this game out, it is free afterall. This game is a work of art in my eyes and everyone should play though it at least once in their life. That is all, give Yumi Nikki a chance and I guarantee you will fall in love.", "timestamp_created": 1655238234, "timestamp_updated": 1672844354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

days of the Great Recession, there were many adults and children alike who simply did not have the funds to buy all of the games that they wanted.

It's a simple RPG maker game, but this game did something different. Yume Nikki wasn't an RPG, it had no RPG elements, it didn't even have dialogue, it told its story through its imagery, leaving the details up to the viewers interpretation. It's legacy is seen even to this day, hanging up in the ranks with games like Corpse Party, a LEGENDARY horror franchise.\n\nI recommend that you take the time to experience a little bit of RPG Maker history, and see why this game is a cult classic after all of these years!", "timestamp_created": 1654754625, "timestamp_updated": 1654754625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116708232": {"recommendationid": "116708232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377036781", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1654391957}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to like this game, everyone seems to like it, the environments are interesting, but the game is just BORING.

Resolution is locked and the game features 2D retro pixel art asset flips.  All of this makes this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer. \n\nGamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.  Leave this terrible fan fiction in the shovelware bundles where it belongs.\n\nWhile this looks to be free, it's free because it's an advertisement as the developer seeks to bypass paying Valve for store front space by instead paying $100 USD and listing an advert as a full game, to mislead gamers.", "timestamp_created": 1651291419, "timestamp_updated": 1651291419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.139927327632904053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114691980": {"recommendationid": "114691980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210593708", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 900, "last_played": 1638700493}, "language": "english", "review": ":D", "timestamp_created": 1651279908, "timestamp_updated": 1651279908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114650730": {"recommendationid": "114650730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016859256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1599160136}, "language": "english", "review": "I think it's still really worth experiencing if you haven't, Yume Nikki and its clones are the only walking simulators I actually enjoy.

You play as a female character named Madotsuki, who lives alone in her apartment complex with the only view to the outside being the balcony. She is doesn't seem to want to go outside and the only source of entertainment is a made-up NES/Famicom game called NASU, it's barely worth the mention and doesn't affect the game at all. The only real way to make progress is to go to bed and sleep, once you've fallen asleep you're in the dream world, leaving Madotsuki's room will take you to a realm called the \"Nexus\" with several doors leading to different dream worlds. \n\nSo you may be asking, what is the goal of Yume Nikki? The objective of the game is to traverse dream worlds locked behind different doors and collect abilities called \"effects\", along the way you will encounter strange imagery and odd residents of the dream world who just seem to go about their business and pay no sight of mind to you as you continue your journey to seek and collect different effects. The worlds you will encounter will range from an innocent world full of snow to a world filled with grotesque body horror full of arms and eyes, the game may not be what it seems as it will surprise you with it's imaginative and chilling images. In between the worlds there are events that can view, some can only appear under a 1/6 or 1/4 of a chance and may happen at random so be on the lookout for anything different or try searching for them. \n\nDespite the game being 18 years old the visuals and game-play still holds up well today. Everything about the game breathes charm and curiosity along with an added sprinkle of mystery and unease, it should go without saying that everyone should at least play this game once their life. Even for those who may not have given much thought I'd urge them to give it a chance. It may not be for everyone regardless of play style, but you'll find something to appreciate in this special game that has even inspired and influenced the creator of OMORI and LISA.\n\nThe game isn't without imperfections however as there are a few things in the game which should be mentioned. The game is non-linear but rather open world and free to explore with several areas having a pathway the leads deeper into another part of the dream world. This may sound fine, but the way game wants you progress is too expansive and confusing. Let's imagine a hypothetical scenario where there's an effect/event somewhere around the map, to find it you may have to search in every direction until you find as it could be a specific spot. So you waste time looking up, down, left, right, northwest, southwest, northeast, and southeast until you finally find it. What I just summarized is what you'll be doing 90% of the game and it can get pretty old real quick. The game-play structure of Yume Nikki isn't flawed but it is far from peak game design, mostly tedious and boring. It's not a deal breaker but you will notice it when adrenaline of trying to find a new effect or event comes into play. \n\nAnother problem with the game is travelling, let's say you found a specific dream world within one of the many dream worlds and want to visit it again. Sorry to say, but You are out of luck. The game has a few connections to certain parts of the dream worlds like the [spoiler]elevator in graffiti world that takes you to the mall/subway area[/spoiler], but not all of them are connected like a big maze, so most of the time you'll just have to re-count your steps and hope you find it again. This is very annoying but not a deal breaker, just an inconvenience. I want to talk about the effects real quick and talk about how they're kind of underutilized. I already mentioned how in the game you have to collect several effects to beat the game, what I didn't mention is 1/4 of them are useful and the rest are useless. Most of the other effects don't really affect the game and are purely cosmetic, personally I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not utilize them in certain areas to progress and receive new effects or progress deeper into the game's worlds. In the end, they only exist to progress the game physically, not narratively.\n\nAlthough these issues can be seen as minor, they can be a little grating. Not enough to ruin the game, but it can make a slow slog-fest even more tedious than it need to be. Overall, I still stand by my opinion that this game is worthy of attention and praise. Whether you understand the game or not, there is no denying Yume Nikki's influence seen through other noteworthy games. The ending alone will leave you speechless and have you make connections through all the metaphorical imagery you seen up until this point and have you ask questions by the end. This game may not be a masterpiece, but it sure as hell is one the most important magnum opus to come from RPG Maker, you won't be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1648330588, "timestamp_updated": 1648330588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112875122": {"recommendationid": "112875122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155561123", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1648323468}, "language": "english", "review": "The melancholy and loneliness that this classic induces is indescribable.

Despite being made in RPG Maker, the game is entirely devoid of RPG elements, and the focus is instead on freedom of exploration around various dream environments. There are several different equippable 'effects' you can find by interacting with various objects and NPCs. Some of these are useful, some of them are purely cosmetic. Finding all of the effects provides the closest thing to an objective to be found in the game, but is entirely optional, and one can find all of the effects while still missing out on a majority of the game.\n\nThe mysterious and elusive creator behind this game used RPG Maker not to make an RPG, but rather as a canvas for an unusual and abstract piece of art. Playing Yume Nikki feels like getting caught in a trance; the bizarre and striking visuals coupled with the dreamy atmosphere and ethereal music make for an absorbing experience. It's easy to become lost for long periods of time, exploring as much as you can, taking in the scenery and strange scenes that unfold in front of you. I'd say that above all else, Yume Nikki is equivalent to a digital art gallery.\n\nThe tension and horror aspects can't be understated, either. Despite its outdated and pixelated visuals, the game's ethereal and gripping atmosphere can lead to feelings of dread and even paranoia as one delves into the darker corners of the dream world, feeling utterly alone amidst empty planes of otherworldly scenery, occasionally littered with abstract beings incapable of human speech. Yume Nikki is infamous for its influence on indie games and the horror genre as a whole, and even an hour or two of playing should tell you why.\n\nComing back to this game on steam many years later, its effect hasn't worn with time and is still just as evocative and absorbing as it was the first time I played all those years ago.

It's absolutely fine if you like simply walking around in a 2D top-down RPG world to explore it but to me it's more of an 'experience', not a GAME I came here for.", "timestamp_created": 1646166912, "timestamp_updated": 1646166912, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401079833507537842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111284840": {"recommendationid": "111284840", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023774811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1648, "last_played": 1642460664}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my favorite game of all time.

The sense of dread this game can fill a player with is surprisingly powerful, even if the game has no proper dialogue or narrative. There are plenty of moments where the player just stares at the screen in disbelief, not knowing what to make of their surroundings, whether that be the hypnotic sounds of the docks, or the wonderful homage to Mother/EarthBond Beginnings in the FC World. The only reason my play-time on this game isn't that long is because I spent most hours playing the freeware version before the Steam version came out. Another way to play this game is through the incredible fan-made online multiplayer mod on https://ynoproject.net . This game is a must play, and I'd also recommend it's fan-made follow ups like .flow and Yume 2kki.

Now, this would make sense if it were a game that got frequent updates, story, or even basic dialogue. But that's what makes this all the more puzzling. Yume Nikki does not have **one** bit of dialogue, or **anyone** speaking for that matter. It's just a walking simulator, but it's far more entrancing than any other game I've played.\nThough, this is due to the way it tells its story: setting. Words would only do harm to this masterpiece. In fact, I feel the more words I use to describe it would just be doing it more of an injustice each time. It's a once in a lifetime experience, over and over again.

I think the best way to summarise this game is: you can beat it in about forty minutes, and have one type of perception of the game, or you can play it by yourself- without guides to get each effect , and find every artifact yourself, and just explore the worlds themselves, and it is certainly worth doing. The game is incredibly large and vast, and it's honestly very delicately connected to one place and another, and it certainly works. Some things (at least for me) were \"unsettling\" (probably due to the music), and the game creates this simplistic yet wonderful extraction of your emotions that works. The black backdrop in most of the world creates this feeling of void and emptiness, and the looping makes it never ending. There are so many small things in this game- characters, details, worlds, that you might not notice if you don't explore far enough, and it's honestly amazing since these things don't matter to the plot but do create a much more strengthened perception of Madotsuki's dream world. The game is, surprising and unexpected. If you play it this way without knowing what comes next then you will be surprised, as the worlds are quite random (as in you could go into a world with no correlation to the former one, not that the worlds rotate), and it honestly wants you to explore because you could be sent from some disturbing place into a spaceship, or from a train onto an island, and so forth. It definitely captures how dreams are and how one can transfer from a peaceful dream that is nice to a living hell. I don't really know why but, upon playing this game (and when you get progress), the controls which are only 8 keys, do not take away from the game. It's very simple and, somehow enjoyable, probably due to just how bizarre and unique this game is still to this day in regard to how it works, and the \"plot\". I can't really say I love the game for characters, there isn't much attachment I gained to Madotsuki or the NPC's throughout, but it is enjoyable just because of how interesting the game is, how interesting and bizarre each environment is and just the effort that was placed into each one. I remember sometimes I accidentally did something and I got transferred into another world that I didn't even know existed in the game. It's just an experience that you should go through- maybe sit down, get something nice to drink or eat, and play for an hour or two, just exploring the worlds and finding your way (with the fandom guide maybe if you get stuck or lost), and this game will not fail to subvert your expectations. At least, that is how I felt when I played the game, as I most definitely enjoyed my experience with it, or at the least, I was kept entertained.", "timestamp_created": 1644184385, "timestamp_updated": 1644184719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109666517": {"recommendationid": "109666517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198849450617", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 790, "last_played": 1644362614}, "language": "english", "review": "dreamy atmosphere", "timestamp_created": 1644173999, "timestamp_updated": 1644173999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109616606": {"recommendationid": "109616606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173740349", "num_games_owned": 830, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1642889445}, "language": "english", "review": "\u201cHumans grow a tree within their minds.

there's still probably secrets the community are yet to find out to this day (the time it took to discover the river creature and the FACE event is probably enough proof to say that there's still a lot left untouched) and makes every discovery feel fresh, new and surprising. \n\n\n\nthe following part of the review will contain mentions of topics such as suicide, depression and sexual assault. please do not read any further if that makes you uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\nplaying through the game after the ending and seeing madotsuki take her own life, and knowing of the terrifying theories about rape, abuse and depression makes the game feel so, so different to play. you notice the symbolism, how the monsters and terrifying faces all seem to mean something now - madotsukis dreams portray a fear of pregnancy and genitals, her feelings of helplessness and weakness and her overbearing fear which is all shown purely through crpytic monsters and imagery. nothing feels strange and whimsical anymore, it seems dark, depressing and frightening. things like o-man's flute, poniko's daytime room and other things that once seemed happy now feel like a break from the horrors the game offers.\n\non the topic of o-man, my lord, o-man's encounter is probably my favourite part of the entire game. it's one of the only parts of the game that doesn't feel lonely, isolated and unnerving. it's calming and comforting, and after beating the game and learning of madotsuki's tragedy, it feels bittersweet and emotional. \n\ni adore everything yume nikki has to offer and it has and always will be my #1 game ever to be released.", "timestamp_created": 1640344477, "timestamp_updated": 1643926424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106406484": {"recommendationid": "106406484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173304930", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 451, "last_played": 1640327708}, "language": "english", "review": "confusing\n\nme likey", "timestamp_created": 1640328036, "timestamp_updated": 1640328036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106397711": {"recommendationid": "106397711", "author": {"steamid": "76561199161242703", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1307, "last_played": 1687938473}, "language": "english", "review": "All other games are simply attempting to be Yume Nikki", "timestamp_created": 1640315185, "timestamp_updated": 1640315185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106385210": {"recommendationid": "106385210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198955323108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1652985049}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

As long as there is some oversight watching out for unreasonable abusers and a channel to deal with tha t, then I think we are better off in the long run. The law can't anticipate or solve every problem in advance and trying to design it to be that way would make it too unwieldy, burdensome, and in some cases potentially wildly inhumane.

The first one is the most obvious... Namely that humanity survived into the future without help the first time through... Perhaps just barely. Perhaps only after great loss and long eras of suffering. In this scenario there is no paradox. Why would the future survivors care to reach back in time and aid their struggling ancestors? These humans were apparently masters of time. Maybe from their perspectPeople seem to be overlooking the deviations from the biblical story as sort of random ignorance on the part of the filmakers. But I think these deviations are coherently intentional ... Scott's take on this film seems to have been to cast the plague miracles pretty much as if they were coincidental natural events. And Moses' conversations with God were hallucinatory episodes triggered by a head injury. These hard to believe events culminated in a rebellion by the Hebrews and provoked the one remarkable event that is hard to deny historically: namely, Ramses allowing the Hebrews to leave Egypt. Perhaps Ridley Scott is saying, in essence, \"Eventually the story of the Exodus got turned into a miraculous mythology. But here, dear viewer, is a plausible rendering of how it all may have really happened.\"ive of being able to see through all of time, everyone to them is in the \"present\" (as was apparent in the tesseract construct). Perhaps they chose to reach back in time to render aid to fellow humans out of compassion, to save a lot of lives -- much as we might render aid to less fortunate people today.the Metalocalypse of anime. It's not. They go in the opposite direction. DMC is about a kid moving to Toky who wanted to be an indie pop act, but for some unexplained reason wound up in a death metal band that he hates. And the comedy comes from him stumbling into situations that are way over his head. He's touted as a metal god who mostly lives up to the reputation by accident. It's sometimes really funny. It was obviously cheaplyYour accusations here are way overblown. Your assertion that there is some sort of quality judgement about one music style over another (akin to racism as you imply above) is just not there. She simply chose a music style that she knew that he did not enjoy. That was the point of the message. You should not force other people to listen to your music because they might not enjoy doing so. Comparing this to Guantanamo torture is just way off base. \"Gross overstep\"? Hardly! Finally, there's no way he would have to sit and listen to the music for 20 hours straight. He was probably given several sessions to attend... probably something like 5 days in a row for 4 hours each. You just need to wind down a bit and take a look at this again in a couple days.

Not only is it as remarkably influential to a particular aesthetic that you can find many indie games taking inspiration from, but the game itself is not only beloved, but also quite unusual and unique. My biggest takeaway with this is that it's yet another game in an ever-increasing list that I've played that represent why it's pointless and reductive to attempt to boil games down to things that are \"objectively good\" in one way or another, because if this approach was taken, then there's no doubt that this game would just be swept under the rug. After all, when taking a broad look at this, it's really little more than aimless exploration where you just walk around until you hit a dead end or find fun collectible effects, many of which do completely nothing, and yet, this is still a truly incredible experience for so many reasons an a deserved cult classic.\n\nI feel like the biggest way in which Yume Nikki accomplishes to much is thanks to its constant vagueness. Everything about this feels obscured, disconnected, and seemingly meaningless on the surface, many areas are just large, empty spaces, sparsely populated with an object of some sort and maybe a door or two to another large, empty spaces, interactions with the various entities often result in a mere sound effect or maybe a charming little animation, and there's not even any semblance of active threat for the vast majority of the playthrough. I feel like this vagueness really contributes to the game's atmosphere and can quite easily put the player through a variety of emotions while playing, which ties nicely into the surreal nature of dreams, where scattershot events often feel loosely tied together if even that. This total emptiness combined with the short, looping music and the way you've got things like these giant, barely comprehensible beings floating in the background, or random beasts that serve no purpose end up providing the player with this profound sense of paranoia for quite a while, nothing feeling quite right and the constant barrage of this atmosphere ends up piling upon itself and resulting in one of the freakiest experiences I've had in a game.\n\nWhat I truly feel makes the atmosphere of this game special however, is the way that in time, it becomes exceedingly apparent that the fear and anxiety that the player feels is less due to any imminent threat, and more to the whole idea of the fear of the unknown. Everything about the world constructed in this game feels so alien at first, doors leading to unrelated places, endlessly branching paths, constant music changes or areas dedicated to barebones, abstract imagery, and yet, this doesn't always stay quite so disconcerting. After giving the game a couple of hours, you really start to feel like you've gained some understanding of your surroundings, and those moments of finding something new, or even retreading familiar ground, end up feeling really comfy as you explore this endlessly charming, strange dream, with the seemingly endless possibilities gaining a certain sense of intrigue and excitement as opposed to just feeling daunting. I could definitely see this mostly becoming a comfort game of sorts to me, being able to once again jump in a world that's so devoid of any qualities of reality and getting immersed in the incredibly dense atmosphere all over again, with the sprawling nature of it undoubtedly revealing some new stuff that I never have seen before.\n\nThe effect system is pretty cool in the way it directly contributes to this gameplay loop, with very few of the powers actually having much of a tangible use beyond some neat events that give the game some more detail than it could first seem, but also just being able to provide a bit of a fun visual change in a way that ends up making you connect a bit more with Modotsuki. With all this said, for as much as this game might be amazing, it is definitely not without its flaws either. While the exploration is largely truly fascinating and gives some of the strongest vibes in gaming, I feel like at times it becomes more of a massive, cumbersome pain instead. I feel like there are probably a few too many areas that are almost exclusively giant, empty spaces with a couple of things sparingly spread around to the point where some of the interest in exploration gets completely lost because you're just walking across a big, scrolling flat colour for ages, and while a couple of these were really interesting, especially the snow area with it's really pretty atmosphere, the quantity of them ended up being a bit much in the end, with some being far worse than others. There were also a couple of frustrating elements that made me completely dread the possibility of having to go through it again, particularly the one that was a huge maze of islands connected by teleporter squares, without enough visual information to be able to differentiate them from one another to the point where you could be aimlessly and frustratedly wandering around for way too long, just hoping that you'd eventually find the way out.\n\nEven with its shortcomings, Yume Nikki is a truly amazing game but also one that I definitely understand not being for everyone. While I felt that the atmosphere and general vibes carried the game to such a high degree that its intentionally barebones gameplay ended up working almost perfectly fine for me, I also could definitely see the perspective in which it doesn't and it just all feels like aimless wandering without any substance. I really enjoyed my time with Yume Nikki, all the small narratives and goals that I set myself, all the weird and wonderful dreamscapes to explore, and especially the way that the naturally increasing familiarity that a player gets with this game as they play ends up changing the atmosphere and tone in such a dramatic way to the point where what first felt like an uncomfortable foray into unfamiliar territory ended up being a thorough exploration of a surreal, beautiful world that you wanted to discover all the little details of. Really just, fantastic stuff, go play it\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1636372302, "timestamp_updated": 1636372319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

It hurts me to say it, but the best way to explore is generally to make a grid and explore every single zone. So walk from the door sideways till u get back to the door. then move 1 screen down so u can just see the tip of the door still as a waypoint and walk horiontally till u get back. And doing that for the entire map....tedious, but its likely to find u everything u need to find.
