Also you come across a good priest who was cursed to die if they let you into their temple, good thing i have a scroll of remove curse prepared by a high level wizard, nope cant cast on NPC's, oh well spend 5k on diamond dust for a true resurrection (a spell that can bring back some one who has been disintegrated into dust) nope.

I'd say a standard playthrough would be ~100 hours or so. I played on Normal difficulty without any DLCs. Here's my verdict.\n\nHighlights:\n- Mythic paths feature unique spells, abilities, and dialogue options.\n- Overwhelming amount of character classes and builds.\n- Secret optional bosses can be encountered throughout the whole game.\n\nNeutral:\n- Dozens of companions. A few can be missed. Some bothered me.\n- Hundreds of spells for sorcerers. But prepare to read paragraphs of text to understand them.\n- Good luck figuring out Pathfinder mechanics. Random pop-ups were not enough for me.\n\nDisappointments:\n- Tutorial features voice acting... and then characters are silent for almost the whole game.\n- No guidance for Crusade Mode which begins in Act ll. Almost made me uninstall.\n- Enemies have +40 armor class in Act IV and beyond. You spend 10 rounds missing all attacks.\n\nMythic Path Review (No Spoilers):\nI chose the path of the Lich. You can resurrect important characters and travel with them, which is great. Be a spellcaster, like a sorcerer, to gain access to powerful undead magic (melee characters are neglected). Some mythic quests make you wait 30 days for something to be built, which sucks. That happens twice! Otherwise, I enjoyed being a lawful evil character.

For a game that requires A LOT of reading, the dialogue is written well. \nThe game is HUGE and very easy to sink many hours into. That's one of the game's strengths but also a weakness since sometimes it felt like a slog and overwhelming. The replayability value, though, is very high.\n\nThe graphics are decent, the music is excellent, some annoying bugs here and there, but nothing game-breakable (for me).\n\nOverall, it was an enjoyable and fun experience, and it is worth playing if you love complex RPGs and a good long story.

It's a great book though, the issue is it's not a book and so I have all this gameplay pulling me out of the story.\n\nFor one the gameplay is unbalanced as hell and some classes didn't get treated as well as others. I have two specific softlocks under my belt from playing a mounted class. That's not including 2 more softlocks I'm pretty confident you can get with any class.\nThe game is a corridor of loading screens and time wasting mechanics. The crusade is a great example of this. You can't automate orders for your armies to travel so you need to go through one by one telling them to move, then you need to fight enemy armies (that you'll probably win because crusade is easy) for ultimately nothing but more crusade mechanics. The entire crusade menu has a separate loading screen from the regular world map. Not to mention map travel is slow an monotonous, it's essentially one big loading screen to enter a loading screen except you have a random chance of getting caught in a fight. I include the puzzles in this section too, most of them are boring and terrible with awful UI elements and IMO inconsistent reasoning. There are five puzzles which require you pick up their pieces is other random dungeons, what's that you just checked your mandatory guide and realized you missed the pieces, time to travel all the way back to that dungeon and search. Those same pieces in the UI do not visually match up to the pieces in gameplay. Act 4 is it's own bucket of issues when it comes to timewasting.\n\nI have limited grounds to speak on gameplay as about halfway through I decided I hated it and turn it down from normal to story mode. That said the first few hours were peak, it was decently balanced and it didn't require you look at the in game wiki for each enemy and their 60 resistances, 8-16 permanent buffs, 6 immunities, and whoops they have an AC of 50. Keep in mind normal mode debuffs these enemies from their default stats. \nThen there's the issue of your own characters who can have 30+ activated skills and all this in an RTS combat scenario. \"Turn on turn based mode idiot\" I hear you say, and to you say \"My man, there is so much combat in this game that if I turned it on I'd probably have 150 hours of gameplay instead of 102.\" The deciding factor for me going to story mode was this, the combat turned into either the enemy instantly died, or I died having not brought their health down at all. Every single fight was so one sided in one way or another that I just didn't want to bother. I reiterate, at the start the gameplay actual feels decent but as the campaign goes on it gets worse.\n\nThe voice acting is, acceptable. The thing with it though is it can pop in and out randomly at times. A friend explained this to me as something that happens in classic RPGs but when someone introduces themselves to a conversation voiced and then the entire conversation is voiced, then someone doing it again except the rest of the conversation isn't voiced it has to be budget constraints. It makes me kinda wish there were no voices since it even happens in important story moments.\n\nSo what does this game have that redeems it? It has a pretty good story, that said I will call it out on inconsistent writing. Act 5 aside from some high points felt like it was rushed, things happen for the sake of it. \nIt also has net positive companions, I think the worst they can be is boring but at the top end you have amazing companions on every side of the moral spectrum. While I'm speaking on that, Owlcat, the dumbest thing you can possibly do to a character is hide their alignment because anyone with two brain cells knows what that means. You didn't hide it, you drew attention to it.\n\nMythic Paths they're amazing storywise, if not too limiting in potential roleplay. If you don't know what a Mythic Path is I won't explain it any further just know that you get what you pick.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? No, I recommend the story, the game gets in the way of it and so I believe gameplay became its very own time wasting mechanic. I don't want to play this game I want to read it. Playing the game is a waste of time, reading it is a pretty deep roleplay experience.\nSo buy it on a really steep discount.", "timestamp_created": 1700593300, "timestamp_updated": 1700593300, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150595781": {"recommendationid": "150595781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021831737", "num_games_owned": 1180, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 58884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "playtime_at_review": 58884, "last_played": 1700592686}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La mejor adaptaci\u00f3n de un juego de rol de mesa a ordenador que se ha hecho nunca, y el mejor homenaje a los clasicos Baldur's Gate o Icewind Dale.", "timestamp_created": 1700592788, "timestamp_updated": 1700592788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53414452075958252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150592722": {"recommendationid": "150592722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050800167", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 51181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 733, "playtime_at_review": 50448, "last_played": 1700684436}, "language": "english", "review": "Story is great, mechanics are awesome, combat is fast (you can speed up animations in options!), and the story can diverge based on your options.

I'm only just getting into the game and while its had its good parts its also had its more...meh parts. The character creator is like the opposite of beginner friendly XD The game just throws so much information at you and doesn't really try to explain it so I was pretty overwhelmed from the get go. But once I got into gameplay the actual in game tutorial is really helpful and pops up just enough so I can figure out whats going on without it being annoying. Combat's pretty good; I prefer turn based mode because I feel like I can get a feel for the different abilities/moves better in comparison to rtwp mode where (esp if there's a bunch of enemies) it can just be a lot going on. I also like that the devs gave the option for both so the player can pick whichever they like best. Story and characters are both okay so far; with both there's been a few really strong moments where I'm like \"Woah that's interesting! I want to learn more about that\" but those aren't as consistent as I'd like. But I'm intrigued enough to want to see how they'll progress as the game goes on.\n\nOverall I'd say check out some in depth reviews/gameplay first to see if you'll like it then get it on sale if you can.

You really do need to understand Pathfinder if you want to have a good time here, because the game doesn't do much to help you learn. There is an encyclopedia but I don't think it's crazy to say I don't want to read hundreds of pages of rules when I am trying to enjoy a video game. This is Pathfinder 1E, so the system is still very, very dense.\n\nIt's especially a problem here because this game is really hard. It's not insurmountable on normal difficulties, but you really need to have a good understanding of Pathfinder and optimized builds to get a grip on this. If you don't already know Pathfinder well you are going to have a bad time.\n\nI also really didn't like the Crusade elements, they got tedious fast. You can shut them off, but unfortunately the entire game is paced around them and it locks you out of some of the best story elements. If you're going to make content optional (which, clearly, is something they did because a significant portion of their players disliked it!) don't punish me for not opting in. The weird pacing with crusades off means that sometimes you have to just rest for a week to make something happen, and watching my character sleep is never a fun experience.\n\nIf you like Pathfinder, though, and you like really difficult high level content, this game is pretty good. The engine is still clunky as hell and a lot of things are broken (Cavalier, sadly, is both one of the most fun and one of the most unplayably broken classes) but nothing else really does what this does.

Most of the flaws of the game stem from the tabletop rules, but in this instance is ever more pronounced since it uses the mythic rules which are even more broken: the incredible power spike that those skills give to the player means that the enemies cannot be competitive unless they have very bloated stats, which are in this game. Still, bloated enemies bring even more problems, especially on harder difficulties: crits can one shot everything from both sides, most feats and builds become useless (because you won't hit and won't pierce resistance, saving throws and immunities), and you'll find yourself to take the same feats over and over on every char if you even wanna hit something. \n\nCombat is often resolved before is even started, it mostly depends on the buffs you have, if you have the right spells available and if you win the initiative, especially at high levels. There's no place for tactic in combat, since the first who hit will usually one shot the opposition. Buffs are so prominent that if you manage to dispel enemy buffs you've already won, bosses become instantly pushovers, but good luck with that if you don't have the right build/ mythic path since the caster levels are so bloated (unless you play with tabletop tweaks mod, then you can use Mage's Disjunction and dispel everything automatically with no roll, as per tabletop's rules).\nThe tedium of buffing and tracking the ones have also add to the general negative experience.\n\nUnless you play on an easy difficulty you'll be forced to specialize and pigeonhole every character into one specific role, more often than not that character will do only one thing and every attempt to do something else will result in failure. For example If you specialize in enchantment spells your other spells will often become useless (buffs are an exceptions, those are basically required and never useless). \nThe enchantment spell school is especially representative of the problem (Save or suck) because using it will result in only 2 possible outcomes:\n1) you will disable every enemy on turn 1 and walk over them\nOR\n2) enemies will be totally immune and your enchanter become instantly useless (a lot enemies are immune to ming-affecting later on)\n\nElemental damage is heavy hampered cause all enemies resist everything (elemental weapons are especially useless unless they do sonic damage). If you get Ascended Element you can bypass resistance and immunities, and this mean that is basically required if you wanna do elemental damage. \nThis is reflected in many aspects of the game, furthering a downward spiral where enemies are \"immune\" then you use\na \"ignore immunities\" ability, and then enemies will be \"even more immune so that your ignore immunities won't work\" and so you'll have to use the \"ignore immunities +infinity\" and so on and on. Frankly this is bad design plain and simple.\n\nBUGS BUGS BUGS and Poor User Interface\nBut let's leave the pathfinder rules behind, since those are not Owlcat's fault, and let's talk about the playability of the game, or more precisely, few of the more egregious shortcomings:\n- The game is bugged as hell (see below)\n- There's only one way to know what status conditions do, getting hit by one and read the tooltip on your char. The result is that you will read spell's descriptions without having any clue what actually do \"blindness\",\"staggered\", \"dazed\" and so on beforehand (good luck in choosing the spells and feats you want). The only alternative it to know Pathfinder, luckily for you the rules are available for free on the net.\n- Some mythic powers that add new features to your char (like second bloodline for bloodrager) won't show on character sheet, and you'll have no idea what you'll get when you level up, better save beforehand.\n- Wording on skills is subpar, and often you'll pick feats only to discover later that don't do what is wrote in their description. Often you'll have no idea what the description even means unless you are well versed with Pathfinder's rules.\n- Crusade mode is just bad, tacked on as an afterthought, is light Heroes of Might and Magic but without the tactics and the strategy. Is not hard, but is a chore and it slow down the gameplay.\n- Due to the above mentioned reasons (and many more), the game is almost unplayable without mods (Toybox, full respec, Tabletop-tweaks, are just the bare minimum)\n\n\nFew of the most egregious bugs:\n- in turn mode using range touch spells will not work and make your char stuck and waste your turn. This happen when the character should move and then use a touch action, in these cases you should always move before casting, but the again, if you cast once you're close to an enemy you will likely get and attack of opportunity...\n\n- The move options in turn mode are extremely finicky, very often you'll lose a turn just by clicking, sometimes even when you don't do anything at all.\n\n- Some skills are so bugged that will actively make you character worse, one of such example is \"Focused element\" which can reduce around -25% of your mage total damage because of how badly is implemented: it will apply two times your damage as two halves, but on the second half won't put any of your actual bonuses so you will lose half of them (you can use toybox to remove that feature and to salvage your char, but you'll have to remove it every time you level up).\n\n- Sometimes debuffs will become permanent on you and no spell or other cure will remove them, can happen with many sort of debuffs like confusion. In these cases the only way out available is to enable the option that removes debuffs when you rest from the difficulty menu. Same for buffs, it can happen that you mantain some powers even after you respec, this is beneficial to you, but still a bug.\n\n- Quests and NPCs will get stuck, save often in different slots.\n\n- and many, many more\n\nThere also some beneficial bugs, for example You can use metamagic on spells that you gain when you wear rings (like ring of the salamander) and this will make those spells stick in your spellbook even after you remove the ring. Or the fact that using shield Bash with large shields won't give you any penalty, and many more.\n\n\nSTORY\nI don't have any more drive to write about the story, let's just say I didn't like it. Is taken from the Pathfinder adventure path of the eponymous name, which have the same level of writing as the campaigns that I wrote as a GM years ago, as to say very low, clich\u00e9 and predictable.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you can stand all the bugs and use mods, this is still a serviceable game, but personally I would suggest to try something else, like Pillars of Eternity: Deadfire or Divinity Original Sin 2 (I have yet to play Baldur's Gate 3 so I can't say anything about it).", "timestamp_created": 1699571402, "timestamp_updated": 1699571402, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479704797267913818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149835176": {"recommendationid": "149835176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329998500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5498, "last_played": 1699566253}, "language": "english", "review": "this shit bussin fr fr ong ong", "timestamp_created": 1699566095, "timestamp_updated": 1699566095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521592617034912109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149824797": {"recommendationid": "149824797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042030821", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 6938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6938, "last_played": 1687268205}, "language": "english", "review": "A significant improvement over the last game in a LOT of ways.\n\nIf you haven't played Kingmaker but were considering it, get this game instead. \nBoth stories are standalone so all you'd be missing are the rare references to the other game which are easily missed anyways.\n\nThe level of character customization options are honestly insane and i'm pretty impressed by the levels to which you can go in that regard.

But basically just treat it as not having that feature and you can get along just fine.

Companion generators always make games like this better, but holy Hera this game has some issues.  Most of them are in regards to world-map traveling and crusade fights; in particular, morale.  You can go around and curb stomp every demon army available, and then, your units will mostly skip their actions in battle because their afraid to fight....  \"We just destroyed all these demons threatening our very souls!  But what am I living for!?\"  *insert autistic screaming and running*  Who comes up with this?\n\nIf you were dumb enough to take non-mages as your generals (like I was), you will never win another battle because all of your soldiers cower in fear after destroying hordes of demons.  This is easily the dumbest element of the game and in the top five of worst implemented game mechanics of all time.  Once your morale becomes broken, making progress in the crusading aspect becomes extremely slow and costly of your personal shekel account.  Granted, most purchasable items in this game, just like in almost everyone of these types of games, is useless.  Which means you're walking around with a lot of shekels and nothing to spend them on but resources for your army, and naturally, the conversion rate is pretty bad.\n\nAnother problem is with armor class.  Its very difficult, if not impossible, to make it through the game on the default setting without AC buffing.  Enemies have no problems with regularly hitting my front-line cleric, who has an AC of 31 unbuffed, why and how are what I ask when I see her hp go from green to red in less than 3 rounds.  Of course, this doesn't work the other way around, but when it does, your fighting nobodies, and your wizard still dies in 3 shots or less.  It sucks having to buffing people constantly in order to make it through a battle with enemies that are roughly your level.  This makes the concept of feats, armor, and shields seem useless because they are without magical aid.  This limits your ability to play the game with a party of fighters, rogues, or whatevers.\n\nWizards, are almost completely useless.  Outside of greater magical weapon and haste, wizards can't reliably contribute much to a fight.  Firstly, they are targeted heavily, which is fine, but it gets annoying quick when they get smoked within a few attacks or are paralyzed to do anything because they regularly fail concentrate checks.  Secondly, even when you become a specialist wizard, choose all feats that improve your spells with that school, boost them with metamagic, pass a concentration check, finishing it all off with a prayer to Odin, your spells regularly fail to deal significant damage if they even hit at all.  I had to use 3 fingers of death on an enemy that was lower level then I was, and just as I was about to use a 4, my melee chumps came over and killed him....   Lastly, ingredient requirements for spells is cool, somewhere over the rainbow, but not in Kansas.  We don't do that in Kansas Toto.\n\nI understand Pathfinder went through great lengths to not be sued by wizards of the coast, but damn, they need to simplify their descriptions of feats and other such things.  What their trying to convey is hidden behind a wall of gobble D gool and I'm not Italian, so I don't appreciate that.  They need to hire someone capable of simple direct communication.  No one comes here expecting to read a book (the description) about how \"improved dumbassery\" works, but sometimes that's what happens.\n\nThe corruption that builds when your sleeping is a good idea but, when implemented, it forces you to teleport BACK to the kitchen to make yourself another corruption free sammich.  Then, you're privileged to slowly march where you were before to resume your journey.  Until you fail a perception check, and you will fail a perception check, then you get to enjoy being surprised and surrounded by the enemies.  And guess who's gonna have an enemy targeting them?  That's right, your wizard!\n\nThe last thing I'm gonna cry about is the overall speed of the game.  This game feels painfully slow when doing anything.  Casting spells, walking, everything feels like it takes forever because it does.  I don't know if there's a way to speed up the game or not, but man there should be.\n\nOverall, this is a very good flawed game that has a lot of DLC that no one should ever buy.

The game being expansive isn't the problem; in fact, I view that as a good thing. However, there are not enough surprises or other incentives to keep you playing. For lack of a better term, mediocrity ensues as the game overstays its welcome in a particular state.\n\nIf you like CRPGs or strategy games, then by all means, give it a try. I can't say I was disappointed. It was reminiscent of DOS2 and BG3. But there are some things I must address:\n\nSurprise attacks while adventuring should be unwarranted in space you occupy with troops. They were so tedious, that every time they occurred, I lowered the difficulty settings just to be done with them. Of course, this resulted in me accidentally fighting some relevant mobs on easy, which detracted from the gameplay.\n\nI chose to play as a lich, to become the best tank. I had chosen this based on the recommendation of a youtube video. What I did not consider, however, was what a negative outcome this had on the story for me. First of all, and spoiler alert, the game forces a scene in which your troops attack innocent civilians and convert them to the undead. Your own civilians, no less. This really doesn't make sense, firstly because although it would make sense that a lich would be evil, from a roleplaying perspective it hard locks you out of being an antihero, and second sacrificing the intelligence of civilians for the brainless undead isn't a logical maneuver. Finally, you must give up love, which, honestly I don't understand. Where is it ruled that evil people, or undead for that matter, cannot love? The mind is in tact.\n\nI also got hard locked out of the secret ending, as I was no longer able to interact with the book. Meaning I would pretty much have to go down the lich path for completion for even some modicum of logical sense. Emotionally at this point, I the player became disconnected from the story.\n\nThe looting mechanics in this game are fantastic, and the demonic woman is actually attractive. So the romance is nice. The game was otherwise fun up until the gameplay itself became too tedious to continue. This combined with my own detachment led to me quitting.\n\nI enjoyed the attempt at options in the game, even though I ultimately wasn't satisfied with them. There were a lot of puzzles I didn't feel like were worth my time. And I wasn't a fan of the exhaustion mechanic, with my team almost always becoming exhausted resulting in frequent trips to the castle because you can't sleep in the wilderness without gaining horrible penalties from the corruption meter.\n\nI want a sequel to be released.

But it has some issues.\n\nIt is horribly unbalanced. Some classes are just plain useless. And it's very easy to brick a build. You will need to bring in your accountant to review your character sheet.\n\nThis is countered by incredibly interesting companions. Who had their build bricked by the devs at level 3 and you cannot respec it because reasons. Example I'm talking about is ember with blackened and point blank shot as a CASTER. \nShe is still fairly good, don't get me wrong, but here's the issue: You gave me a huge amount of classes to experiment with and a bunch of companions you cannot fully respec and you brick their build. Why? Why would you do this? \n\nI went with mercs except for sassy oracle guy for important reasons. So I can actually experiment with builds, but I lose out on some party chat and just general flavor.\n\nThis brings up the difficulty is frustrating in a lot of ways. Like getting gibbed. A lot.\nI just disabled deaths door stuff and remove bad effects on rest to save me the headache. They pass out ability score damage a lot (The infamous shadow makes an appearance fairly early on)\n\nSince some classes are useless this doubles up on the frustrating difficulty and the terrible builds.\n\nCasters are good, but they feel weak. Archers feel weak too. \n\nMelee and pet classes are overpowered. Mounts are really great. Melee classes with pets are stupid good.\n\nYou will still want a healer and a caster (maybe two casters) for magic damage and CC. Some enemies are weak to magic damage, you will need to get your accountant to go through the enemies stat pages to find out which.\n\nOverall it is very difficult to come up with a viable build and the game, even on normal difficult, will absolutely destroy you if you screw it up.\n\nThat being said figure out what you are doing and it's an interesting game, fun mechanics, fun story.

It's too big for a steam review so I'll just past the TLDR from it. TLDR: If you're looking to buy this game, I would go with a resounding\u2026*MAYBE*. I really enjoyed my single playthrough of this game for the most part, but I see a ton of flaws in this game. I may come back to one of my other characters at some point but I don\u2019t see that happening any time soon. I have read reviews for the DLC and I have to say, I\u2019m disappointed with what I\u2019ve read and can confidently say I will not be picking up any DLC. That's a shame, because I really would have liked them to fix some of the flaws and expand on some of the good things they did in this game. If you\u2019re a fan of CRPGS, and you don\u2019t mind a game with some major flaws, and you\u2019re looking for a game with an overall good story and decent roleplaying, then I say give this game a shot. If you\u2019re looking for a fun challenge with polished mechanics, while also being entertained by a good story, then I would say *Maybe.* If you\u2019re set on looking for a CRPG that is going to be a good challenge and don\u2019t really care about a story, then I\u2019d probably turn you away from this game. My biggest wish and the main thing that stops me from playing this game is the ending. Anyways, thanks for reading the review, hope it helps!

I have been playing cRPGs since mid 90s with PS:T and BG series among my all time favourites and when I saw the high review scores for this game I was delighted. I waited to play this game for about a year and a half as I wanted to have a relatively bug free and balanced experience and I managed to get this game on half price a few weeks ago.\n\nNow after having sunk 150 hrs in this game, I am 60% through but whatever I have accomplished so far could have easily been achieved within less than 15 hours.  Everything in this game takes too long, map activities are uninteresting and boring, not to mention that map conquest mechanics is a massive time-waster. There is also too much irrelevant, uninteresting and not so well written dialogue. This game takes two paragraphs to explain something that could have been conveyed in two lines. Another thing that bothers me massively is that your party members' dice roll results in '1' far too often than any other number. In my play through 39% of all my dice rolls resulted in a '1' and almost 85% of my dice rolls resulted in a single digit. I have never seen such loaded dice in any DnD game, there is definitely something going on with dice rolls, its not random or  fair by any stretch. \n\nAll in all I am regretting buying (even at half  price) and playing (and sticking with) this game so far, I am no longer enjoying it. Where BG games are a 10 for me, this game is no more than a 6. This is a massive disappointment and giant time sucking black hole. I am 80% convinced of abandoning my campaign and moving on to another game. \n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone as there are several other great games,  tv shows and movies out there, don't waste your time on this.", "timestamp_created": 1699047089, "timestamp_updated": 1699061321, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574667215347290039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149470182": {"recommendationid": "149470182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022229299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 176, "playtime_at_review": 12331, "last_played": 1700581362}, "language": "english", "review": "Huge game with plenty of replay-ability.

Enemy mobs with insanely high AC, spending 10 minutes buffing just to overcome it, only to have an enemy roll 3 20's in a row and destroy my party. \n\nAlso, \"Last Azlanti\" mode doesn't even tell you it's permadeath and will delete your save if your party all dies. Why the actual fuck would you not tell players that? Thank god I only got shafted in the prologue. I can only imagine if I had spent 40 hours just to get screwed over and all my time flushed down the drain solely because the developers didn't think it prudent to add a detailed description of a fucking mode. \n\nI just had to stop playing.

The first thing I must say is it's buggy. A lot abilities don't always work right. That's okay because the game has the most luxurious save and difficulty system of any game I've ever played. If things go wrong, just change the difficulty to get past a fight. It's brilliant because you'll never be stuck with insurmountable combat.\n\nThe other side is the choice system in the game which is smart, but also not for everyone. While I do like the consequential can't miss-a-beat approach to choices, it's incredibly easy to pick the wrong thing and miss out on important things later (particularly endings). It's not a problem per se, it's just that anyone who buys this game must understand that messing up decisions means having to go back to an old save. And if you just do autosaves and quicksaves, you're almost guaranteed to not be able to go back far enough in time to make the choice you thought you made to get the outcome you wanted.\n\nThe other element of the game is that character skills, spells, and resting before combat are extremely important and requires serious party maintenance and gear decision making at harder difficulties.  This is where the game can seriously become overwhelming. Managing 6 characters who are complete characters that are important to your party could be a lot for people--sometimes it even is for someone who enjoys hellacious complexity. Again, this is a double-edged sword, it gives you all the freedom with all the responsibility. The upshot is that, if you play a certain way, the player character is effectively the main entity and the party is just a support system for your awesomeness. However, this also means there can be an element of invalidation of other party members.  On the other hand, if you want to do it, a well-developed party member can be an overwhelmingly powerful ally.  It's just that the game plays best when power and assistance are all focused on making the main character the ubermensch. \n\nThe story is clever and while not all the characters fit well, everything is written with POV in mind. Every line, response, bit of feedback, and opinion from people in the game world is based on what they think from their alignment, experiences, deity they follow, and past decisions. This game has a  truly astounding amount of writing. There are some standout characters that will challenge you to think if you're listening, and there are also plenty of on-the-nose extra silly characters as well. Even the villain has a point and, if you find out that character's story, you find yourself in a dilemma. \n\nThe second best part of the game (after the characters and narrative) are the special powers and associated story divergence.  These can go off the rails in a good way, while others feel a little half-baked. Unfortunately, not all the special stories are as enjoyable (gameplay) or interesting (story and quests). Others are downright brilliant or utterly unexpected. I've played the entire game through 5 times, and each time it's to pick a different path. The further along you get, the greater the differences.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game if:  you like to read interesting stories, want a grand adventure that will take many hours to complete, like complex games, or are a raving fanatic of either Pathfinder or D&D 3.5. I would not recommend this to people who must have every line voice acted, want an action-oriented RPG, or get bored easily.", "timestamp_created": 1698834546, "timestamp_updated": 1698834886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519408524036407471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149292069": {"recommendationid": "149292069", "author": {"steamid": "76561199235772480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8208, "last_played": 1698814968}, "language": "english", "review": "I found this game very enjoyable especially with all the twists and turns and revelations.", "timestamp_created": 1698815025, "timestamp_updated": 1698815025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149281410": {"recommendationid": "149281410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009434027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 35272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 309, "playtime_at_review": 33985, "last_played": 1700002900}, "language": "english", "review": "guide for players:\n1. game have dlcs, if you play them be sure to read next steps\n2. choose evil or good paths, if you choose good ideal is angel or azata.. if bad, choose necromancer or devil\n3. if you like keep companions, dont choose swarm (maximum evil)\n4. if you like love interests, NEVER CHOOSE FULL NECROMANCER OR SWARM (you will end as skeleton - sacrificing loved ones during ritual, or as swarm of bugs hated by all)\n5. still, game easy reach max char level, so CHANGE TO MYTHIC LEGEND TO GET UPGRADE TO MAX LVL 40 ON MAIN CHAR\n6. if you want love interest areyshale (past demon)...

As someone who has played a few CRPGs before, I like to say that DOS in general and BG3 are much more user friendly and introduce you to the game slowly so you aren't completely overwhelmed by a thousand mechanics and spells. Here, you'll be so glued that you won't feel like it anymore after (in my case) three hours.\n\n4. performance: I don't know why and why not, but I get just +40 FPS in the game.

I think the choice of the game engine, complexity and redundant activities like crusades is what holding this game from becoming popular.\n\nI think the complexity compromise may be the following: a 2 different combat systems: casual and hardcore where the hardcore mode has additional modifiers. Potentially costly decision but might have paid off.\n\nI will continue following the devs as I find some concepts intriguing and I have wishlisted the Rogue Trader and have some expectation for it too.\n\nAlso my personal cons:\n- combat mechanics is way too complex / steep learning curve in general\n- no drow/dark elves race\n- furry race\n- low refundability potential. You'll barely see a gameplay withing 2 hours if we do not count character creation as a main gameplay pillar\n- long intro. Combat is the major part of the game and one has very little chances to try it out under 2 refundable hours. Thus, I cannot tell if it's good or bad.\n- no possibility to ride most of the animal mount unless you're a halfling/dwarf/gnome. Fixable with mods tho. (my dream character is dark elves riding a lizard mount like in HoMM5)\n- requires modding to get rid of the crusade part\n- the game is too long to beat. I doubt that 100% of the 300 hours are enjoyable.

I still haven't seen everything -- every time I play again I find something new. The mythic paths are the best part of the game, they are each completely game-changing in totally unique ways. I even dig the alignment system--those who complain about it think that being evil means selecting every single dialog or choice marked \"evil\". Not so! Some of these options represent a completely depraved evil, others are more nuanced. Want to be a lawful evil bureaucrat? You can! Choose your dialog options based on what fits your character, which will end up equating to some lawful and some evil but not all of either. It's a great system and it works, you can be whatever kind of character you want to be.

I will gloss over how unbalanced certain classes are in relation to each-other due to the sheer number of available classes, but the massive chasm between them still cant be ignored. It is a cycle of needing to stack buffs before every single encounter (dont forget to save beforehand), entering combat, dispelling all of the buffs the enemies get for free, and after all of their buffs are whittled down as far as they can you still have to fight with obnoxiously high armour class of the enemies and blatantly unfun enemies that just have immunities/resistances to half of the things you can throw at them. Then you either succeed or reload a save to do it again. I wont spoil anything but the final boss felt genuinely insulting to fight against. \n\nIt is a different type of combat, but it would be dishonest not to mention the absolute atrocity that is the \"strategy game\" part on the campaign map, where you play the most low quality turn based board game that isnt even fun the first time around. \nWell, you can disable this strategy game part! Except you will be missing out on a lot of rewards that you wont be granted in any other way.\nThe world map itself has no redeeming qualities, it is too large so you just end up resting all the time, which the game actively punishes making you take detours to your city to rest up properly, making the journey EVEN LONGER. The random encounters on the road also do not make the experience any more pleasing.\n\nTHE SETTING - Very cool. The worldwound and demonic invasion concept are still very fun to make your characters around, to see how you can integrate them into the setting and see your ambition come to fruition. Also custom portraits make character creation very fun. \n\nTHE STORY - Very little of it is interesting and it is surprisingly linear, very negative because one would expect mythic paths to largely expand role-playing potential, but no. If you choose a lich mythic path you will be an evil sorcerer, if you choose the demon mythic path you are a power-obsessed animal an so on. Your story is very much based around what mythic path you choose, not the choices you make throughout lets say, interactions you have with other important characters in the story. Without spoiling too much I choose the demon mythic path on my first play-through and tried to redeem my character through a scripted event that is sure to happen when you select demon. You get to roll a skill check to switch your mythic path to a Legend. The problem? I failed the check and remained a demon. This doesnt bother me by itself, and if anything it could have added a lot of depth to my character, but what followed most certainly did. The very important character that gives you the opportunity to do this check acts like you straight up denied their request for redemption and basically say \"well fuck you\" and then are never seen again. The only options I was left after this encounter, that were related to the mythic path, was just boring, scary villain stuff, like I made no attempt to better myself. In the ending slides the narrator was like \"he died and noone liked him because he was a demon\" which made no sense as said character was actually good aligned by the end and made an effort to do good in the second half of the game.\n\nCompanion quests? Well... The companions themselves are ok, but if you deny their one request that they have for one specific companion quest, you will just remain strangers throughout the whole game. If you put a quest off there will be nothing to remind you of it and no in-game repercussions if you dont pursue them until the end credits. And therein lies my biggest problem with this game. \n\nWhen you miss out on a story element, it is just gone. It offers you no alternative to this questline that \"you didnt do properly\" or even worse because you failed a skill check, which is basically asking the player to save-scum. The quest line is just over and there is nothing you can do about it. You get the feeling you always did a wrong thing when a quest ends early for whatever reason, which is horrible for an RPG.

The compass helps but it's definitely annoying to have to constantly re-orient the screen to get an idea of what I'm looking at. The individual area maps feel cramped and very vertical because you're always trying to turn it to get a wall out of the way or see around a bush.\n\nThe maps are interesting but the game has a fun habit of hiding exits and critical points from you at which point you get to scramble to every point on the map to try and find the special exit. I got stuck on a number of maps just clicking around trying to find where I was supposed to go which is the opposite of fun.\n\nWhile the world itself is detailed, the stuff in it is not. Loot becomes repetitive very quickly and you see the same parade of items come up again and and again only to be dumped off with a merchant which leaves you with mountains of gold and nothing to spend it on.\n\nYou'll end up with piles of scrolls and potions that have to be sorted and handed out to your companions (put a pin in that) to a degree that you almost don't need a spellcaster at all with the number of scrolls you end up having. Maybe that's just a function of the difficulty I was playing on (Normal) but I spent a lot of time selling off scrolls and potions.\n\nThe miscellaneous treasure is a nice touch but it becomes visual noise pretty quickly. Why pick up a handful of gems that is, somehow, worth only a few gold when I'm already sitting on a ton of gold? Most of the \"treasure\" doesn't sell for enough to make the time needed to sort it worth spending.\n\nThe \"loot\" part of the game dies quickly because you just don't want to spend the effort to sort things that are only marginally different from the last fifty things you've found.\n\nCombat is in an awkward place. It's not bad but it's also not great. Your companions can't/won't use items (like potions or scrolls) unless you select them and tell them to use the item which means you get to micromanage your team to get them to use everything. You can highlight a single ability or spell that they'll hammer incessantly but that's of highly limited utility. Combat necessitates a large degree of micromanagement to a degree that gets exhausting and you just kinda give up and zone out after a while.\n\nReal-time combat can be an absolute blurry mess and turn-based makes every fight ten times longer than it needs to be.\n\nOverall it just makes me want to avoid combat simply because I don't want to bother with it.\n\nThe Crusade portion of the game feels...extraneous. You can turn it off but it just kinda begs the question of why have a whole huge part of a game in it if you can just....turn it off? The map system in general is a further annoyance. You have to rest constantly and it slows everything down to an extensive degree and doesn't really add anything to the game so it feels like just a way to slow things down.\n\nYou can make potions and scrolls but...who cares? You're drowning in those already, why would you need or want more of them? You can cook things but the buff is \"meh\" and you have to lug around a bunch of special ingredients to make them work so, again, why bother?\n\nThis is a lot of small gripes but they pile up to a game I can't really recommend. I think people interested in the dungeon crawl aspect are going to get bored pretty quickly and while the story is rich, the gameplay kinda gets in the way to a degree that's off-putting in a hurry.\n\nWith a re-work and some streamlining, I'd be genuinely excited about this game but I can't recommend it at this point.", "timestamp_created": 1697673143, "timestamp_updated": 1697673143, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148460676": {"recommendationid": "148460676", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999614752", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1478, "last_played": 1697755849}, "language": "english", "review": "Plays like PF1.

Most of dialogs are without voice acting.\nOverall, I really like it and I think it is more engaging than 90% of modern RPGs which we have nowdays, with cool graphics and \"big\" open world.\nFinished it after 250 hours, that story was really something) I Definitely will replay it once more.\n", "timestamp_created": 1697539544, "timestamp_updated": 1700413704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148370201": {"recommendationid": "148370201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067221842", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1699425118}, "language": "english", "review": "took me 75 minutes to create a %#^$ing character", "timestamp_created": 1697516654, "timestamp_updated": 1697774297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148346863": {"recommendationid": "148346863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119174465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 10647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3188, "playtime_at_review": 3135, "last_played": 1700697974}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic combination of customisability, great gameplay and great writing.", "timestamp_created": 1697478071, "timestamp_updated": 1697478071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148345548": {"recommendationid": "148345548", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985233230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 17396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "playtime_at_review": 15781, "last_played": 1700655318}, "language": "english", "review": "The best RPG on steam right now, but you need to be willing to learn the mechanics to a minimal level.", "timestamp_created": 1697476455, "timestamp_updated": 1697476455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148334470": {"recommendationid": "148334470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074027759", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 9158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 570, "playtime_at_review": 2391, "last_played": 1700790463}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are a fan of the old isometric RPGs, this is a definite buy.

Could have been great but let down by some very silly design decisions. Owlcat had a winner here then shot themselves in the foot. Still, with some mods and a lot of perseverance, it's salvageable. There's a rough diamond buried somewhere in there.\n\nThe good stuff first. It's got great world building, a decent plot, a huge variety of options for character generation, memorable companions to adventure with and some good dungeons to take your party through. Great itemization too. The story sucked me in, I happily spent hours tinkering with my characters, and I liked almost all the companions. A couple are a little stolid but the rest - very well done. Even when they were a pint sized darth vader. The world's most sarcastic assimar. Or a raving psychopath.\n\nThe ok: The combat's.... not bad. It sells itself on being either turn based or rtwp. Tbh, neither is that great. Turn based is pretty dumbed down compared to say, DOS2, while RTWP was desperately crying out for the variable speeds that POE2 gave us. It turns into a Benny Hill sketch most of the time. Luckily, there is a third option - tactical timeflow - which I found an okish compromise. The game's basically paused and you hold down a button when you want to advance ut at 50% speed. It's a bit frenetic and not as good as POE2, but it's doable for the most part. \n\nThe bad... The dev's decided to try their damnest to stop you enjoying all of that goodness. \n- The ruleset's unnecessarily overcomplicated, poorly explained in game and they hired *fextralife* of all sites to do the wiki. Yeah. You'll google alot.\n- They decided to force you to spend half your time playing an incredibly clunky, dumbed down strategy game (crusade management). It's awful.\n- When you get to the crpg part, the map's enormous, you can't go two steps without a random encounter or having to rest, and half the stuff on it's pointless\n- It really doesn't respect your time. It makes you backtrack far too much, forces you into long dialogue sequences, and often prevents you from saving. I dread returning to the keep.\n- It's still pretty rough around the edges. The pathfinding is *awful,* there are a lot of minor glitches eg pets disappearing, characters not rendering, abilities not working... and some more serious ones though. \n\nIn short, it feels like they bunged absolutely everything they could think of into the game with zero filtering; sure some of it's darn good, but some of it's just padding, and some of it's pretty awful. \n\nYou've basically got two choices. You can switch crusade management to auto, put levelling on auto, turn the difficulty down to story mode and just  sort of cruise through it for the story. Or you're going *need* mods - toybox, bubble's autobuff, the crusade auto win mod, the bug fix ones... - have a lot patience and be willing to do a lot of googling to figure stuff out. \n\nDoing that stuff it was worth it for me but I'm not sure I'd recomend this to someone who's only got a casual interest in crpgs, say just coming from BG3. You need to have a lot of time, an awful lot of patience and be wiling to push through a lot of makework to get to the fun stuff. When you do, it's great.

Eventually it clicked and now I cant stop replaying it.\n\nAmazing game, with plenty of issues. Very easy to mess up your builds without proper knowledge of game mechanics. But once you get it down the gameplay loop is very fun. Companions and npcs are diverse and intriguing with plenty of variations to their stories and endings. Main story is engaging and exciting, side quests are much less consistent in quality. Crusade mechanics suck. Forced waiting for crusade content as well as the transition to Act 4 and the secret ending are super annoying. Maybe 15% of dialogue is voice acted. \n\nGet some QoL mods, adjust difficulty settings throughout the game or follow a strict build if you dont mind not going in completely blind.

I'll save you the entire bug list I have and just tell you the one that broke the camel's back. Had a bug where my player character would randomly swap to the other characters randomly after the scene where you unlock Trickster. Because of this, whenever I get to an HUB area I would spawn where that NPC would normally be at, and also be stuck in their animation(like sitting or leaning but sliding around) but because certain HUBs have them inside a building, or wherever, I end up outside of the map zone and can't even escape. Constantly reloading is both annoying as Hell and also didn't fix the problem even saves prior to the Trickster scene. This alone has been entirely frustrating which was fixed thanks to ToyBox (temporarily). It already sucks needing an external factor to make something functional as it is but it also created its own problem. ToyBox ended up making every single creature, NPC, etc, into having 1 HP and I didn't even tinker with rules or whatever it just happened at some point after I unlocked the army mini game. What fixed it was reloading but with ToyBox disabled, however, as you can figure, the bug where the PC would swap happens after loading into an area randomly. Then, I'd have to turn the mod back on to fix that but then mobs return to 1 HP. You can see where this continuous loop of having to disable/enable save loop can become tedious just to fix one singular problem. Now, the story has proven to be interesting enough for me to somewhat tolerate one shotting everything but man did it get so boring that I was just better off YouTubing cutscenes. I do somewhat recommend the game as long as you have ToyBox because there is an actual boatload of fun you can have but be wary of hard/soft locks the game may throw at you.

It's more of a combat focused and roll-playing game than a dialogue focused role-playing game, but if you want to play it for the story, you can do so on Normal difficulty or lower, and possibly with auto-crusade on if you don't want to micromanage that.\n\nThe Pathfinder system is way too overcomplicated, and adds a bunch of unnecessary classes and subclasses to the D&D 3.5E system it's based off of, but you can compensate for that by picking a pre-made character or a basic class and just selecting the auto-level up option, which keeps things nice and simple for new players.  If you like talking your way out of situations, Persuasion and Perception are important skills, maybe along with one knowledge skill.\n\nNote that this game isn't as simple or sleek or high quality as Baldur's Gate 3, but if you're a CRPG fan, it's probably worth checking out when it's $10 or less on sale. I'd say try the base game first to see if you like it before trying any DLC's.  If you're having trouble deciding what to play, a front line warrior that can take some hits like a fighter is good, along with any class with sneak attacks.  This game strangely doesn't give you enough high strength front line types or physical sneak attackers.  So Fighter, Barbarian, Rogue, and Slayer are good options, as is the Bloodrager.  If you want to try the new mounted combat system, the Cavalier is a decent choice as well.  \n\nNote that you can pick any class you want, but you don't get a well balanced mix of classes to pick from until way after the first act (which takes double-digit hours to get through) is over with.  This can be compensated by creating your own mercenaries, but if you prefer to have companions with personalities and stories along who chip in during dialogue, most of the ones you get for the first 10-20 hours are low strength, squishy casters for some reason.", "timestamp_created": 1697010799, "timestamp_updated": 1697010799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148007919": {"recommendationid": "148007919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203219317", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 6362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 808, "playtime_at_review": 5012, "last_played": 1700448059}, "language": "english", "review": "DON`T let the negatives convince you to skip this game, I am just putting my honest thoughts into the review so you know what you are getting.

Which is possible if you want it but is not required to be able to play the game. Just use the difficulty settings accordingly.\nThis is a game about knowledge ,understanding the ruleset and builds, \nbut not so much in the moment tactical decisions and adjusting on the fly.\n \nMainly what I don\u00b4t like is some things are poorly explained and information you might want is not always easily found.  The might and magic inspired crusade portion has battles that are in themselves fun enough blasting fireballs on enemy stacks, \nbut the management portion can get a bit tedious when you want to explore the crpg side of things.\nMost of the puzzles suck.\nIt\u00b4s also weird how I am the commander of the entire crusades but my travel party is 6 people.\nLastly some quests are hard to complete without a guide as they give no indication where to go and while exploring is fun having to scour the map for some object or person just isn\u00b4t.\n\nMy first play-through told the wholesome tale of the amorous adventures of a dhampir lich and the love of his life, a murderous mutant spider lady..person..thing. \nIf you ever wanted to role play as Aragorn when he summons the army of the dead and saves the day  , in this game you can.\nBut more like if Aragorn murdered the fellowship of the ring and reanimated their corpses.

I just feel it's trying to do too much with the crusade management, puzzles etc. and it's a little overwhelming for folks that just want to roleplay or relax.

Game is good, but I'm so frustrated and disappointed that it fails to be great do to some baffling design decisions. Even more so since I think first Pathfinder game had pretty much same issues, but they either failed to fix them or chose not to, and I think it's the latter, and that just frustrates me more.\n\nPros:\n* Absolutely massive amount of variety and possibilities in character building\n* Mostly not too complex rule system\n* Plot is ok to good, could be better but could very well be worse too\n* Some memorable characters\n* Great turn based combat system\n* There are actual skill checks outside the combat\n\nCons:\n* Bugs. They've ironed most of these out but there are still some minor bugs here and there. For example character might cast \"cure minor wounds\" spell, walk next to the target, then do nothing and lose the spell. Haven't encountered anything gamebreaking though.\n* Not that great game engine. Looks OK at best, but will absolutely try to fry your GPU in some places if you max everything out even while limiting fps from drivers. I recommend turning some effects down (shadows and ambient occlusion if I remember correctly). You won't note a difference in visual quality but will hear the difference in fan noise.\n* Terrible Heroes of Might and Magic clone jammed in it. You can turn this off but then you'll miss some loot, and arguably game content, even though it's poor content. You can also turn it to very easy, but this just leads it to still be a massive time sink and bore. They basically took town building and combat from HOMM3 and left everything else like exploring out. Not just that, the combat is really poor version of HOMM3 with less unit variety, less spells, less tactics, less everything.\n* Overland map on which you will spend endless amount of hours walking back and forth slowly\n* Inflated numbers of attacks. I don't know if this is a thing in first edition pen & paper too, but I find it ridiclous and not fun that both enemies and my characters can often hit like 6-8 times per turn.\n* Difficulty. I'll discuss this more next.\n\nSo the elephant in the room and biggest thing in the game trying to ruin everything, the difficulty level. It starts of pretty good, game being challenging but mostly fair and you have actual solutions to the challenges. But it starts getting worse further you get in the game. Before going into detail I must say that you can tune this very well yourself in the settings, so that's good. Turning enemy stats to minimum you should have no trouble beating any encounter. But pretty much everything else about the difficulty is bad. First of all, game devs have either never played an actual pen&paper rpg, at least never GM'd one, or they have not understood a single thing about what's the point in role playing games. You cannot exercise any kind on role play in your character builds if you want to have even a slight change of getting through the game on \"Core rules\". Which by the way has nothing to do with p&p rules (granted I only have experience in 2ed), enemies stats are way inflated compared to p&p and encounters don't follow any rulebook guidelines about designing balanced encounters. If you don't min/max you're characters, and do a perfect job at it, you won't have any change in some encounters. Even with good min/maxing, prepare to die all the time. Good GM keeps the party on their toes, throws some challenges, but also a life craft if party struggles. Not so here. This game's GM destroys the party and laughs like this is some Wizardry game or something.\n\nEncounter design in the game is absolutely terrible most of the time. It's like devs went \"well we don't know how to design an interesting and challenging encounter, so let's add more levels to each enemy\". This means that unless you know beforehand what's coming, and have a solution for it (min/maxed character just designed to counter this kind of enemy), you will have no change of winning in some encounters. You will regularly encounter enemies that have 8 levels more than you do, and you can do nothing about it (except turn down difficulty level). Might be even ten if you happen to go in wrong place too soon, and there's no indication what so ever about area levels. This means your fighters won't hit even with rolling 20, your casters spells get saved every time and your tank get's hit with every attack and dies in four hits. Not fun, at all.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad if the difficulty would be on point on some setting, but it's not. It fluxuates wildly. I mostly play with \"slightly lowered enemy stats\" and random encounters and minor mobs are usually just about right, but then game throws some impossible boss fights and I need to lower the difficulty, only to bring it back up afterwards, which is tedious. Also \"go do something else and come back later with more levels\" is not an option on some places.\n\nSo the conditions to enjoy this game:\n* You enjoy min/maxing over role playing\n* You enjoy massive unfair challenges\n* OR you are fine with turning down difficulty level either temporarily or permanently\n* AND you don't mind constant save scumming (oh please remember to save often and on multiple slots)\n\nIf game still sound good to you, go for it. Might even be the best game ever for you. I know it is for some, just not me. I still do enjoy it most of the time, but oh boy does it frustrate me every now and then.", "timestamp_created": 1696767877, "timestamp_updated": 1696767877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739664912223815918", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147853736": {"recommendationid": "147853736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005998651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1697365916}, "language": "english", "review": "terrible game, bad balance, game breaking quest bugs that stop you from continuing, super woke", "timestamp_created": 1696755067, "timestamp_updated": 1696755067, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.350699841976165771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147853190": {"recommendationid": "147853190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026551276", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1448, "last_played": 1696787302}, "language": "english", "review": "I would recommend this game actually , however I think it's not for everyone.\n\nI used to play Baldurs Gate 1 and 2, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity...\nLet's say I'm used to CRPGs.

I gave up on the game after 20-ish hours.\nThe whole crusade gameplay is just a pain in the ass in my opinion.

This is no easy game to wrap your head around if you're coming from Baldur's Gate 3, it will be feel more akin to neverwinter nights 2, as well as the infinity engine games. However, if you're willing to put time into the game, the story is very consistent, more times than not reintroducing characters you met prior and your choices have consequences. There are bugs present in the game since it switched over to a newer release of Unity, however they are non game breaking, some events for quests however could feel apparent and break the immersion for you. I can only think of 2 instances, but they are very small side quests for companions.\n\nAnd for OwlCat, DLC 6 better include a [b]nenio romance[/b] or we will riot.\n[/td][/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1696735964, "timestamp_updated": 1696738337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781417608261108398", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147841640": {"recommendationid": "147841640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139846465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 22253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 392, "playtime_at_review": 21861, "last_played": 1700640909}, "language": "english", "review": "Wrath of the Righteous succeeds at much of what Kingmaker succeeds at, but more expansively and a little more refined - a classic style real time with pause video game representation of the Pathfinder system, with loads of character build options, not bad writing and a decent dialogue system, and a degree of choice and consequence. The game in general does a good job of customization options all around, including with difficulty and play styles. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed that aspect of it and arguably prefer this game over Baldur's Gate 3 because I prefer Pathfinder's complex character options to 5th edition DnD's simplicity. That said, the complexity of Pathfinder, especially as adapted to a video game, doesn't perfectly pan out easily and it becomes difficult to avoid things becoming broken or otherwise requires meticulous build plotting that can get overwhelming and convoluted. And this is something of a munchkiny action RPG in practise. I don't mind that to an extent.    \n\nBut the main problem with this game is that it makes the same mistake as Kingmaker by spitting the game into both a core RPG and a strategy game at once that blocks one from proceeding with exploration and quests, but it is a bit less egregious about it than Kingmaker. Because of this I never quite finished Kingmaker despite putting lots of hours and numerous playthroughs into it, because the strategy game part ruined my immersion and blocked the exploration and RPG game play. It got frustrating that way.  \n\nI would prefer a pure Pathfinder RPG experience without the strategy game aspects forced onto the player. Even in this game I had a lot of playthroughs but never went beyond the 2nd chapter or never made it to Drezen precisely because the strategy game system seemed to block my progress with super difficult battles. It's a bad design choice trying to do too much at once. Unlike Gwent in the The Witcher 3, which is an optional mini game that's fun, the strategy game part of the Pathfinder video games is a requirement and a tedious chore.   \n\nThat said, overall I'd rate this game a 4/5 and consider it a step up from Kingmaker. The core RPG is pretty good and the game serves its function as a video game  adaptation of Pathfinder.

There are so many decisions that for the life of me I cannot understand, in addition to Owlcat seemingly being unable to design normal encounters.\n\nLike I first mentioned, the rail roading. This is one of my greatest pet-peeves, since the scenes where this happens look good on paper, but are horrible in practice. In the first dungeon you have that four-armed demon thingy that you walk right in front despite having an elevated tactically superior position. Then there's an encounter with a necromancer, and your party cleric decides to charge ahead on his own. In theory this makes for dramatic set pieces, in actuality it's just incredibly clumsy and hamfisted.\n\nAnother big problem: the encounters specifically customized to fuck you in the ass. Like the succubus in the lesbian couple's house, that has permanent mage armor + shield (iirc AC 28), can also cast invsibility to guarantee flat-footed condition, and level drains with a +9 touch attack (completely ignoring the usual grapple requirement for a succubus's energy drain ability). Owlcat... are you alright? Do you think stuff like this is okay? It's the bandit archers from Kingsmaker all over again. m(\n\nThe biggest disappointment so far was the encounter with the eyeless demoness once you make it back to the city. It's pretty obvious that the game tries to recreate and -capture the first encounter with Irenicus at Waukeen's Promenade in BG2, but if just falls flat on its face for several reasons:\n\n* In BG2 it's Irenicus that decides to let you go in order to deal with the Cowled Wizards. In WotR a low-level NPC \"drags you away\" from the 28 HD epic level demon with AC 35 or whatever.\n* In BG2 Irenicus actually doesn't want to kill you, because he wants to continue experimenting on you. In WotR you're nothing but an inconvenience to the epic level demon, and in the battle she drops the (relatively speaking) equivalent of tactical nukes on your party without batting an eye.\n* In BG2 Irenicus is already in battle with another, similarly strong, force. In WotR the 28 HD epic level demon can focus her undivided attention on your level 3 or so party.\n* In BG2 that encounter happens on \"neutral ground\", so to speak, with Irenicus having no particular reason to stay and die on this hill. In WotR the encounter happens at the demon incursion's primary objective, and the demon has absolutely no reason to retreat or otherwise abandon her position.\n\nSo all in all, this encounter makes zero sense from a mechanical and narrative perspective. Situations like that by all means should end with a TPK in round 3, at the latest. There's no chance that a ragtag bunch of low level crusaders could ever survive that encounter, and my character waking up in the tavern had me crying from laughter.", "timestamp_created": 1696697118, "timestamp_updated": 1697059305, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455272167921066284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147807127": {"recommendationid": "147807127", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976913644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 4796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1211, "last_played": 1697664150}, "language": "english", "review": "Great CRPG!

And although big does not always mean better, WotR uses this to its advantage, to mitigate its weak sides. \n\n  \nThe gameplay, an isometric view with tabletop Pathfinder rules (d20), has been already proved to be a solid choice in similar games and even the prequel of this very same game. The combat experience is customizable as you can swap between real time combat and turn-based any time. The game features a great variety of options: with almost 200 classes archetypes, several races, weapons, companions and story paths; the game ensures not only a unique experience for every player but an amazing replayability as well. \nThe different difficulties make the game interesting for every player no matter their skill or experience. With higher difficulties, most viable builds are required, while easier modes are beginner friendly even if the mechanics are not optimized. For the first gameplay, I advise taking a medium difficulty and taking a look at several build and items guides in order to have a balance between challenging and fun experience.  \n\n  \nThis kind of story-driven games usually takes the videogame storytelling to a new level, however, WotR presents a blander and weaker story compared with other games of the genre such as Pillars of Eternity. The game essentially is 10 in 1, as you will choose between 10 different mythic paths that are almost like different games one from another. With the already long duration of the game and having 10 different paths, it is only natural some of them are weaker or even the overall quality of the story is not superb. With all of that the story isn't bad by any means, it's still engaging and won't disappoint you even if it's not a masterpiece.  \n\nIn fact, one of the positive things I can highlight from the story is it brought me back to the long DnD sessions I used to play as a kid with my friends, sometimes with absurd but entertaining plots or quests and gaps that point an unexperienced Dungeon Master. I know it's something very personal, but I feel the storytelling of the game is less \"professional\" and more \"natural\", which is something you don't expect. \nThe game has several DLC's and there are more to come, and while they're not bad, it's the weakest part of the game. \n\n  \nI enjoyed the gameplay, building the different companions and minmaxing their items and spells; the dungeons felt so fun and entertaining and the bosses challenging. Even if I say the story is not the strong point of the game, it is still very enjoyable and fulfills well.

By the end of the game, I had gotten tired of the gameplay and just wanted to finish the story, turning the game on story mode, so I could breeze through the combat. Here are my main complaints about the game:\n\n1. Stories told through exposition dumps: It's not a good idea in books, and it's not too much better in games. This game is very story heavy. Normally, I love that, but at several times, I just got bored with having to read paragraph upon paragraph of exposition, especially when a lot of the side characters that have a lot of text to read have no personality. You need something else besides just dialogue to keep the reader engaged. I'll be honest, I skipped 90% of Storyteller's dialogue because of this.\n\n2. Imbalanced Combat: I'm looking at you, Blackwater! Okay, so this one gets REALLY bad in some parts, especially in Act 3. I was playing the majority of the game on Normal with most of the battles in Turn-based mode. Most of the battles were pretty well-balanced where large groups of enemies and bosses were still difficult and required strategy. However, you reach some places where they just throw these massive beasts with 40+ AC and a quite sizable healthbar at you that none of my characters could hit unless it was a crit. These battles are only possible by realizing you messed up by entering the combat, dying, reloading and then dumping every buff known to man onto your party before starting the combat again, and even then, it takes forever to finish the encounter in real time mode. This was quite common and was one of the other reasons why I lowered the difficulty down to baby mode to finish the game.\n\n3. Resistance to fire / electricity. There are so many awesome spells that you almost never get to use because practically every single enemy in the game is resistant (or immune) to fire and electricity. Nenio just became my buff mage because all her offensive spells either did very little damage due to resistances, or failed due to incredibly high saving through modifiers in the enemies after Act 3.\n\n4. Voice Acting: It's not very good. Certainly not the worst, but almost all the voices sound so out of place in the context of the world of pathfinder.\n\n5. Writing: It's okay. There are some times where the dialogue is great, other times where it's so bad, I wonder how it made it through the editing process.\n\n6. Party Customization: When you first start the game, you create your character and are overwhelmed with the huge amount of classes and subclasses available to you. However, your character is the only one who you can freely customize. Every other character has a set class (and they are pretty standard) and if you don't like it, you have to multiclass, which, since their stats are preset, limits your options. Also, you'll never see their class reach level 20 if you do that. If you retrain the story characters, their level resets only to what they were when they joined your party. I know that if I want to experience the other classes the game has to offer, I can just restart and customize my character with a different class, but the game took me around 180 hours to complete. I don't have the time to do that again.\n\n\nConclusion: The game has some really major flaws, which may not have seemed so major had I not just finished Baldur's Gate 3, but I did, so I can't help but compare. The writing I can get over. Writing is difficult, especially when you are writing this much. Seriously, the amount of text in this game can probably fill a whole book.

I've played a lot of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, a bit of Neverwinter Nights and Icewind Dale, and most recently an insane amount of Baldur's Gate 3, so it's safe to say I like CRPGs, even old and obtuse ones with stupid mechanics like THAC0. That said, I've never played Pathfinder before, either tabletop or games like Kingmaker, so this ruleset and a lot of the terminology in it is largely new to me, and it's with the ruleset that I have MOST of my complaints. If you already know the rules for Pathfinder, this game seems to me to be a perfectly fine and fun video game implementation of them, but if you don't know Pathfinder already then I warn you to steer clear of it.\n\nI think the 5 foot step rule is awful, I regularly move my character in the 5 foot step mode, swear, change to ranged weapon with move action then shoot with standard action, then next turn I have to 5 foot step again because I have to forfeit my move action to switch back to melee again. 2 turns not spent smashing because of one missclick when really the game should just let you take the rest of your movement at the cost of your move action if you accidentally moved 5 feet without it.\n\nCasters feel completely impotent. Seelah crits for 30+ damage per turn, Lann can shoot 2 or 3 times per turn (with Ki) often for 12 damage a shot, and my 3 casters deal 1d3 damage with a cantrip that misses or is saved half the time because they are incapable of \"aiming into a fight\". When I choose to cast one of my EXTREMELY few spells (both in number of prepared spells and number of spell slots), the overwhelming majority of the time the enemy succeeds their saving throw and my turn is effectively wasted, and even on the occasions where the spell succeeds, we're looking at 1d6 damage and a status effect that lasts for 1 round, which is awful when compared to Seelah and Lann's turn. If Seelah is crit and downed it's basically over.\n\nTerms like \"fortitude\" and \"reflex\" and \"will\" are barely explained -- I genuinely have no idea whether fortitude is dictated by STR or CON or something else, reflex is probably DEX, no idea what will would be from.\n\nThere's green \"v\" icons on certain things and I don't think I ever saw an explanation for what this indicates -- I gather that when adding points to abilities like perception and the like that having at least 1 point in the vegan abilities also adds a nice bonus which I assume is like the D&D 5e proficiency bonus, but don't think I ever saw this explained anywhere.\n\nSome spells like \"Create Pit\" have such a long description that you have to expand them just to see how much damage they do or what you can expect from them, and when you've read the whole thing somehow you need to remember that it's initially a reflex save then it's mobility and athletics saves and that you deal a certain number of d6 of damage which depends on who is casting it... right. Now remember all that, and the 500 other spells you'll be offered when levelling up, and maybe you won't have to spend 5 minutes every turn reading descriptions.\n\nA measure of user friendliness such as a % chance to hit when aiming a spell or an attack would be great -- show me the chances before I make the move to save me from spending 30 seconds a round checking for resistances and AC stats just so I know which shitty 1d3 cantrip to use. Show me the % chance for a creature to save on an effect from my spells, or to tell me if the creature is immune to the effect. It's not like I don't have access to this information in the inspect option, and I can see my own character sheet, so why do I have to do so much fucking maths just to make good use of my actions every turn? What do you take me for, a fucking calculator?\n\nMost of the enemies in the first part of the game are completely immune to effects like sleep or mind altering spells, which makes half of the spell lists of Ember and Camellia pointless, reducing them to 1d3 cantrip machines. Camellia has high DEX but few finesse weapon proficiencies, so she's a shitty caster AND a shitty melee unit.\n\nMy custom character is a wizard because I like a high save difficulty class control build, but I can only cast like 4 first level spells per day at level 4 even though I have 20 INT? And I have to pick the spells I want to use for the next day BEFORE I rest because I have no opportunity to change them during the rest sequence if I forget, or during an excursion if I want to change my prepared spells before an encounter? This is NEEDLESSLY obtuse, and fuck any sweaty neckbeard who says otherwise.\n\nCertain mini-boss type enemies are resistant to pretty much everything except \"cold or good aligned weapons\" or other such combinations, which means not only do I need to worry about enhancement levels and masterworks but I also need to bear in mind whether my magic weapons are \"good\" or \"cold\"... Ridiculously convoluted system.\n\nI've been playing on Normal difficulty and I can see insane training wheels in the combat log, +5 to attack or damage rolls most of the time, that's crazy, and it doesn't feel right. If an early-game party is so inept that we need godlike intervention just to play the game on Normal difficulty then that indicates to me that there's a balance problem. I think a better way of handling this was demonstrated in Baldur's Gate 3, where you can reach level 3 before you even reach the first big fight, after which progression slows back down to a more usual rate.\n\nA bug I regularly have is when I ask a caster to cast a healing spell on someone and they start the animation then abruptly stop: it says in the combat log that they cast the spell, but not that they cast it on the target I requested, nor that the target was healed. Their action is consumed and says \"minor cure wounds\" or whatever, and they lose the spell slot, but nobody is healed.\n\nAnother similar bug I have encountered twice with mini-bosses is that I will cast a spell on them and see in the combat log that I penetrated their spell resistance, but then it doesn't state whether the enemy succeeded a saving throw, it just doesn't have an effect on them... what? Where's my fucking spell?\n\nWhy are there different types of AC, like touch AC and regular AC? Why do enemies sometimes have both spell resistance AND the ability to save throws like god himself? Why does my caster need to improve their spell penetration AND their casting difficulty class?\n\nWhy can Lann at level 3 shoot twice for a full round action, but Seelah only attack once at level 4? When I got Lann he had that already but I can't see anything that explains WHY he has that capability on his character sheet.\n\nA truly mindnumbing experience I had early on in the shield maze was with a champion enemy who clapped my fighter and paladin, then Camillia and my wizard spent literally 5 minutes in combat with him. He would miss 90% of his attacks, I would miss 90% of mine. Occasionally I would have to drink a potion. There was no counterplay at all. I simply had to click the same buttons every turn until I had whittled him to death with 1d3 rays of frost. In BG3 I might have shoved him off something high, or thrown a grease bottle to knock him prone, or kited him with ray of frost to reduce his movement speed significantly every turn, but in this game it was unfortunately just an incredibly uninteractive encounter.\n\nI feel like, at 12 hours, I've given this game a fair shot, and I honestly like the classic CRPG stuff it has going on in it. Unfortunately because of the install size of the game, I need to uninstall it to get some space back for other stuff. Given that BG3 exists with a simpler and more accessible ruleset, and a similar price point (excluding sale prices of course), I just can't recommend this game to anyone looking to try a CRPG for the first time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1696280160, "timestamp_updated": 1696280160, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 132, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643443942070007324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147482422": {"recommendationid": "147482422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404694597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1700325253}, "language": "english", "review": "Until this game is better optimized I can not in good faith reccomend it.

The developers, however, decided that there is no need for balance and anyone who doesn't want near-impossible battles should have to play on story mode. I'm sorry, but that's BS. A well-designed game based on an existing ruleset would allow you to both enjoy the story while playing according to the standard rules, giving the option to play on harder modes if desired (which you also can here - I can only imagine the ridiculous character optimization needed to do that).\n\nThe result is a game almost impossible to enjoy casually unless you effectively break the rules. It's not fun knowing that you're not playing by the rules. Just as it's not fun to know that the game is wildly unbalanced. It's not hard to balance an RPG. Games like Pillars of Eternity do it effortlessly. For some reason these developers just thought the definition of fun was making you plan out almost every single encounter and map out all 20 levels of character development from initial character creation.

This statement is not even related to the game's length, which is quite impressive by itself. It's about how this game does a poor job of helping you play the game itself.\n\nThe game plunges you into a tutorial that does help you with the absolute basics in the first part of the game. This is all well and good, but the game completely abandons the idea of providing any helpful information on later chapters. You'll often find yourself trying to understand game mechanics through the in-game encyclopedia, only to realize how nearly useless it is. You may run into descriptions like \"This spell has the effects of spell X...\" without describing or linking to spell \"X\" in question. Or you may find one of your characters with an affliction with no description on how to remove it (is it with rest? Restoration? Remove curse? Dispel? Who knows). You'll be discarding the encyclopedia and ending up relying on external sources.\n\nAnd the game lies to you. \"There are no wrong choices\", except there are. You can try to lean in to the role-playing aspect and create a character based on that, only to find that it will not be viable on later chapters (the game does allow you to re-spec in certain difficulties). The game will also recommend auto-leveling for your companions. Your auto-leveled companions will be nearly useless in later chapters. You will, once again, have to rely on external sources to be able to build your party and start enjoying the game.\n\nWhich brings my next point. The game is very combat-oriented. Almost every situation is only or best resolved by combat. The game will even add random enemies just to pad the game with \"content\". The absence of alternative content types will leave you exhausted by the repetitive combat loop. The few puzzles the game has are ruined by the use of an awful interface. These two criticisms are exemplified by one of the companion quests dungeons, where you will spend hours juggling between endless enemies and horrible UI for puzzles.\n\nEven if you know what you're doing and do things right, you'll end up wasting your time with constant save scumming. Oh yes, the game kind of expects you to save scum, as it is very common to even fail \"easy\" dice rolls constantly.\n\nOn another note, a game that relies on the boring, continuous ritual of pre-buffing just to level the playing field is not being clever. Raising numbers with 6 different buffs just to be able to hit an enemy is a mindless chore, not strategy.\n\nThe game offers a lot of replayability through the different mythic paths and their respective content, but with a lack of new game plus options (carry over money and items at least), I wouldn\u2019t be incentivized to play over a hundred hours of this game again.\n\nMany people may add that mods and other resources can vastly improve this game's experience. But in my opinion, any game that relies on external resources like this already failed to do what should have been the main goal of being a fun, accessible and fully encompassing experience.\n\nFinally, the very last ending scene sort of implies you screwed up you 100+ hour playthrough because you didn't follow the very-specific steps for the secret ending. A final slap in the face for the whole experience really.\n\nI would only recommend this game to people who are already Pathfinder fans, DnD enthusiasts, or masochists. Or you could just breeze through the game on the easiest difficulty and enjoy the amazing characters and story. An \"Enhanced - Enhanced Edition\" for this one may be a stretch but hopefully future games in the series are better.\n\nExtra criticisms: no minimap, no option to place map markers, quest journals don't update properly. The annoying bug where enemies run out of bounds and you have to reload entire fights because you can't kill the enemy that yeeted itself into the void (even in boss fights).", "timestamp_created": 1696009205, "timestamp_updated": 1696009205, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518541932106018066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147290091": {"recommendationid": "147290091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029692881", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 830, "last_played": 1696003406}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm already reading books - I don't need a video game to be an interactive book. \nThe combat is a pain, the enemy just needs to cast a purple cloud that blinds and dazes everyone and it can proceed to end one or few of your characters slooooowwwly- while your characters can move but can't hit!!!\nI understand the amout of small details that devs put into this \"game\" but I don't understand why there's no at least (blind-hit) so you don't walk aimlessly while the enemy fks you up!", "timestamp_created": 1696004086, "timestamp_updated": 1696004086, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449119627475738525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147286028": {"recommendationid": "147286028", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975921252", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1694651294}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to support this type of genre because I want to see these kind of games flourish.\nBut everytime I try, I keep getting stuck on the character creation.\n\nI've prayed for so long that the pathfinder games, pillars of eternity, etc. would eventually bring a simplified description to their abilities, perks, race descriptions etc.\n\nI can understand the need for 1000 lines of flavor text for a spell when it's tabletop because that's how you bring the fantasy to life.\nBut for a computer game, all that flavor text can be visualized with your animations.\n\nAll I ever need to know when I hover over a spell or a perk is:\n\nRange:\nDamage Range / effect:\nResource cost:\nAttack Modifier / Save check: \n\nRPGs are already extremely deep in both lore and time investment, alienating potential lovers of this genre because you failed to make the basic game mechanics approachable is such a waste of the developers time and a huge disappointment as a player.\n", "timestamp_created": 1696000373, "timestamp_updated": 1696000373, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457453608512878418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147283174": {"recommendationid": "147283174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052339877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 18621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 291, "playtime_at_review": 14825, "last_played": 1699845601}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game about mortality.

I always had fun in between, but due to some negative aspects, there wasn't always a time when I just screamed in frustration. I'm not a beginner, I've been playing RPGs for over twenty years, one of my first games was a CRPG, so I'm not a complete beginner.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that the quests give you absolutely no help (in most cases) with what to do next. It's okay if things aren't always shown to me, but then they should be in the quests. But mostly they don't, I have no idea what I have to do next, let alone a common thread or anything logical that I can somehow properly follow. I've already dropped the game once and tried again after two years, I'm in Act 4 and I'm just going crazy. I run around like a blind chicken and just do everything, hoping that this was finally the quest it was supposed to be. I feel hopeless in this poor quest design and feel like I'm wasting time getting everything done. It shouldn't be the goal of a game that I have to use a guide. I've just been annoyed about it for hours and unfortunately it's taking away my desire to play because the story and everything surrounding it is actually fun.\nSome areas are also poorly lit and it's extremely easy to miss paths that you can hardly recognize and then walk around pointlessly for another hour trying to find the right path because no map or minimap helps me.\nIn addition, the combat system is absolutely no fun. I've never had something like this before, something so poorly balanced that it feels like nothing whole, a catastrophe. I'm happy when the fights are over.\nThe tutorial is also one of the worst I've come across. Especially when it came to explaining the strategy aspect of the game, important information was missing. Another 2 hours of blind searching around in the otherwise extremely simple strategy aspect.\n\nI don't know what the developers were thinking, but they have to give their players some guidance somehow.\n\nIn general, the game seems unbalanced and not very player-friendly to me.\n\nAs a result, the story is overshadowed negatively, which I find extremely sad because that's the big plus point.\n\nI love rpgs and strategy games, but this left me mostly frustrated and angry. It doesn't all seem completely thought through.\n\nAt the point I'm at right now, the frustration is too great and I regret paying full price back then. When the frustration has subsided, I'll try to go back to my score, because I actually want to know how my story ends if it weren't for all the negative points.

There's a lot that can be said for this game, but much of it is negative, whether writing or gameplay. It's a tedious game which engages in drastic character assassination, and if the writers didn't care enough to get the world right, there's no reason to care enough to play it, much less buy it. \n\nThe game does not explain much about the beings you face, despite being central to the plot. A dretch, a babau, a glabrezu are all just cannon fodder with different statblocks.  Despite being so prevalent the demons are not given actual characterization, and even at times you find instances where dretches freely roam the streets and claim to have had positions of power, which is laughable, but that's not the ideal type of entertainment value from a CRPG. I could go on for a while, but take it from someone  who has Iomedae (Pathfinder's goddess of justice and valor, who presented as such in the AP) in their profile picture, just don't bother.\n\nIf the headache inducing dialogue between Owlcat's versions  of my favorite characters wasn't bad enough, bear in mind that this game - like Kingmaker - sets aside a great deal of YOUR time for another half-baked implementation which detracts from the actual gameplay: crusade mode, a tedious minigame that is nearly universally despised.\n\nThe combat gets to be tedious, as it's meant to be turn-based, but Owlcat implemented it lazily. It would also be a massive pain to manually buff yourself every day, so mods would be required if you wanted to feasibly use any buffing spells, which the game is balanced toward.\n\n\nPathfinder is very close to my heart, and to this day I play it quite often, alongside Starfinder.

Not to mention, real time with pause is absolute trash and unimmersive. It might work with RTS games where you control fodder that do not have manual abilities, but for RPGs turn based is the way to go. Now WOTR does have turn based combat but it felt both confusing and frustrating, perhaps a flaw in the implementation or just PF 1E. Also, the graphics feel really outdated for a game released in 2021; the character models looks like they are from the early 2000s. The random ambushes as your party traverses the overworld feel pointless, its not fun to fight a giant insect or cultist for the 100th time.

This has to be one of the most frustrating game I've ever played.  Clearly it was good enough to keep me engaged, but I'll be honest a huge amount of my game time is me just hate genuinely getting sucked into a loop of hate playing.  It stopped being fun, and just became about not losing to the terrible scenarios and decisions the designers made.  It just feels like I'm playing a really well-written, but very linear dnd campaign dictated by an unreasonable if not downright cruel GM who actively misunderstands how the tools of the system are meant to be employed.  \n\nEvery GM knows that you want less higher-level enemies with interesting abilities in fights, not huge swarms of frustrating low level enemies because it becomes a slog bug god damn the slogs are everywhere.  Every gm knows that allowing people to rest too much, or giving them too many consumables just allows them to go supernova on every boss, but here I am just reverting my save, stacking buffs, and dunking anything that was too challenging to defeat with tactics.  I've never met a GM so terrible at employing skill checks.  In this game, they are are boring and frustrating because they either barely have a consequence for failure, or you just downright never get to try the thing again.  \n\nPast emulating a ttrpg, even just as a video game in general it is frustrating.  You will find yourself stuck for long periods of time because you accidentally missed that one piece of loot from that one dude's body.  If you are the type who feels guilty save scumming, be ready to get riddled with guilt because often times you simply don't get the information you need to face a situation until you've run into it and found out you just don't have the right pc with you, or didn't happen to have the one spell you need.  Losing hours of progress because you missed one thing is just common place.  Learn to enjoy it i guess.  Information is often presented in confusing ways that then comes with permanent consequences.  Basically the game is riddled with f**k you moments from the devs, so if you're like me and you can get frustrated with video games, or particularly if you play them to get a sense of control in an otherwise out-of-control life, this ain't it. \n\nAnd the puzzles, my god the puzzles.  They all tend to be like a lock, with a conceptual key that opens it, but the key is so difficult to catch onto that they had to make the puzzles themselves incredibly easy to solve.  This is compounded by them being incredibly boring.  For me it creates this loop where I run into a puzzle, I get bored of trying to solve it so I look up the trick and it turns out to be some silly little thing that I personally would never have had the patience to catch onto as part of a game i'm trying to enjoy so I look up just like the most basic hint and it blows the walls off the puzzle and now there is no more joy to be extracted.  No joy in the process of finding the key, and no joy in unlocking the door.  Just bad puzzles that feel shoehorned in.  \n\nTo conclude, this game feels like I'm playing with an inexperienced gm.  They only were able to employ the system towards combat while dropping the robust holistic nature of 1e, and then the combat itself is a bunch of repetitive slogs with poor enemy diversity.  I find it to be more frustrating than anything else, and after over a year of trying to enjoy it, I give up.  \n\nI will say the redeeming factor to the game is that it has a really good story with very interesting characters and a good diversity of paths to take for replay value.  I can see why it is positively reviewed for that reason alone, but I just found myself mentally checking out at a certain point based on gameplay frustrations.", "timestamp_created": 1695501513, "timestamp_updated": 1695501513, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603248894214630127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146885124": {"recommendationid": "146885124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079707647", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5907, "last_played": 1685571521}, "language": "english", "review": "I really liked this at first, but after nearly 100 hours of playtime, I'm bored as hell in the abyss section.

Basically a new Baldur's Gate style game but using the Pathfinder ruleset, the option to play turn based or real-time with pause, and with modern bells and whistles  Here you are trying to help fight back the demon invasion coming from a rift called the Worldwound, which has infected the region for many years.  This game is truly epic, with you starting out as a level 1 character and ending with you having basically god-like powers and fighting demon lords.  Also there is a simple kingdom management system where you fight on the full map using Heroes of Might and Magic battles, with a little town building and dealing with kingdom level events.\n\nNormally I would go through the positives first, but since I gave this a negative rating (when I gave Kingmaker a high recommend) I feel I should address that first.  The game is great in most ways.  I had a few quibbles with the gameplay, but the real problem was with performance issues.  If it wasn't for those I would have recommended this, though not as highly as Kingmaker.  My PC is fairly high end, so it's not my hardware.  From searching the internet, I see I am not alone with these problems either, though they don't seem to be very common.  There were two problems that plagued me.  First was that saving and loading kept taking longer and longer to complete as I went through the game.  I didn't really notice it as a problem until Chapter 4 with saves taking 2+ minutes to complete, and this is on an SSD.  By the end of the game it was like 3-5 minutes.  It really ruined the game for me, especially since this is a game that requires a lot of saving and loading.  The other issue was intermittent freezing/pausing when moving around.  I dealt with this for all of chapter 4 and part of chapter 5 (it started in chapter 4).  Eventually I noticed this sometimes went away and after some testing I found an item was the problem (Covenant of the Inheritor I think).  Pretty sure the issue is larger than that one item and probably related to auras, but for my particular party it was the fix to the issue.\n\nTaking out the performance stuff though, the game has lots of great stuff.  Huge number of classes, races, customization, mounted combat, mythic powers, epic story, lots of side content, cool items, all kinds of stuff.  If anything maybe a bit too much.  Leveling up was something that often made me paralyzed with the options and needing to do research to make sure I didn't mess up my characters.  If you aren't an expert on Pathfinder you will likely need some build guides to get through unless you play something very straightforward.  If you know what you are doing though, you can make some very powerful builds.\n\nSome of the other not so great stuff was the difficulty felt off many times, with certain sections being too hard and others too easy.  A lot of difficult parts were also not fun difficulty, like a surprise attack walking in a city and you die before you even really get to do anything.  Or creatures just ignoring your resistances, or having such high attack scores that they basically can't miss, or having crazy AC so you need a 20 to hit them.  Of course these can all be overcome with the right builds, but without knowing in advance you will likely meet things you aren't prepared for.  Difficulty can also go the other direction.  My main character in Chapter 5 basically couldn't get hit in melee anymore (from ability not AC) making most of that section of the game a joke (not the end though).  You are supposed to be very powerful at that point, and feeling that power is cool, but not sure it was intended to be that easy for that long.\n\nOverall, the game is worthy of playing if you don't bump into the performance issues.  Ignoring that, the game still wasn't as fun as Kingmaker to me due to weird difficulty, less fun combat, weird story (I played a trickster though so that's part of it) and some minor pacing issues (too much combat here, too much talking there, etc).  Still it also has many things better than Kingmaker, so many will like it better.  But for me, none of that matters because the game probably took me twice as long to finish because of technical issues.  I doubt many people would continue on in that state.  I can't recommend a game that might cause someone to quit after putting in 100+ hours.

Careful to watch for 1st Edition not 2nd but it has both.\n\nThe 2nd installment from Owlcat in their Pathfinder series of games. This is as close to a 3.5 D&D game as you'll get these days. Its a top down view rpg and based on the Pathfinder 1st Edition ruleset which is in turn based on D&D 3.5. It is highly replayable just in the amount of classes and subclasses it has but the story even has its own nuances that add to it. Its a very large game with some army strategy elements mixed in and the typical real time with pause or turn based party combat your used to.\n\nBecause so many seem think this is true based purely on their own perceptions, the truth is in this video:\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5Vz3ZjML0I]Does Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Cheat on Dice Rolls?[/url] and no it doesnt cheat the curve is flat.\n\nThere are many story paths to tread both good and evil along with plenty of lore to follow. Theres various lore bits in conversations with highlighted words and tooltips to explain various rules in both the character sheet and character creation by simply hovering the mouse over the parts your interested in knowing. Even the combat log is well explained. \n\nThe amount of lore and other bits available to immerse you in the world gives me Baldurs Gate vibes. The party controls are also in the vein of the Baldurs Gate series as you have 5 companions along for the ride. They are quite varied in their morals / ethics and present some interesting storylines and moral choices along the way.\n\nThe beginning story revolves around the worldwound and it being an open portal to the abyss. The difficulty is adjustable and doesnt disable achievements except those tied to core rules difficulty or above.

I hope I can convey my thoughts in my review if it helps you decide if you want to pick it up or not.\n\nThe game offers a massive amount of customization over its character builds that by starting out without prior experience to the tabletop, will leave you daunted and overwhelmed. The combat is alright with the option to play in Turn-based or in \"Real time with pause\" with the former offering you time to think and strategize for efficiency and with the latter clearing out trash fights.\n\nFor the Story, the game offers a good variety of choices throughout its quest-lines with respect to character alignment and your chosen mythic path, which offers replay value in experiencing the other routes of the quest-lines. The choices you make in the earlier acts can have a wide impact on the general story and at times some choices you do in the earlier acts will come back at the later parts. The Main Story isn't a masterpiece but its decent enough to motivate you to reach its end and your play through may differ if you choose different paths offering a good amount of flavor to your run, as I have played on a Demon Mythic and in the later stages redeemed myself to become a Mortal through the Legend path.\n\nThe game offers a wide variety of companions which have their own quirks and personalities that can make your play through entertaining with some companions bantering during camp rests and at times interjecting on dialogue. Each companion has its own quest-line and the quests on my experience are good except for a certain companion that lets you solve puzzles which is tedious.\n\nHowever the game isn't without its faults especially if you have no prior experience in the tabletop or in Pathfinder as the game does not introduce newcomers to its systems very well. Enemy Stats get bloated in the later acts giving you a hard time if your build isnt well thought of or optimized often causing misses on attacks and spells not penetrating resistances. Puzzles which is varying in difficulty at times easy to do but most of the puzzles I had to open up guides just to complete it especially on one particular dungeon where its all just puzzles breaking the pace of the game and at times leave you stuck from progressing.\n\nOn the Performance side, Act 4 and some parts of Act 5 I have experienced some performance issues like a drop in frame rate when fighting multiple enemies and even when just venturing out the area. There are times when I experienced quests bugging out caused by NPC's becoming uninteractable and areas not showing up on the world map and I had to use some mods to complete the quest. \n\nTo wrap up my ramblings. I highly recommend the game if you are looking for an RPG with a wide variety of choice and depth of customization which makes every play through a unique experience with its different endings that makes you wanna come back for more.", "timestamp_created": 1695116421, "timestamp_updated": 1695116421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146573910": {"recommendationid": "146573910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079839858", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1077, "last_played": 1695353604}, "language": "english", "review": "RPG+SIM+HoM&M....Not bad not terybile", "timestamp_created": 1695102466, "timestamp_updated": 1695102466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146556986": {"recommendationid": "146556986", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992836565", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 29875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29874, "last_played": 1695170779}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\n[spoiler] cryin when my aeon ceased to exist and left a reminder of itself to companions.\nthe law is hard, but it is the law)0 [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1695072429, "timestamp_updated": 1695072462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146555714": {"recommendationid": "146555714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051867163", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 10543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4869, "last_played": 1698711522}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing CRPG", "timestamp_created": 1695070579, "timestamp_updated": 1695070579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146533898": {"recommendationid": "146533898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030565343", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3662, "last_played": 1692515844}, "language": "english", "review": "Join the holy crusade today!\n\nIf you've always dreamt of battling demons and cultists, rescuing maidens, and saving the world from destruction, then this announcement is for you!

Despite being based on Pathfinder, a system that is probably among the most complicated RPG rulesets to ever <bless | curse> this world, it's eminently [i]playable[/i] in a way that a lot of its older Infinity Engine inspirations, like Baldur's Gate and Planescape Torment, never were. This time, you do not have to suffer through a barely-playable game just to get to the good writing!\n\nAnd good the writing is. D&D has a reputation for being a \"generic\" fantasy setting, but that's only if you ignore all the interesting parts of it -- and Pathfinder: WOTR is [i]all about[/i] those interesting parts, especially the cosmology, kind of in the vein of Planescape Torment.\n\nThe \"Mythic Path\" system is an incredible addition, particularly in how it ties together gameplay and narrative. Effectively, it lets you take on the archetype of something beyond the mortal pale (an angel, aeon, loki-esque trickster, etc), and use those powers to \"break the game\" and even \"break the story\" -- but it's far more interesting than a simple power fantasy because [i]your ability to \"break the rules\" is bound by the archetype you choose[/i].\n\nThe Crusade system, with its clone-of-Heroes-Of-Might-And-Magic combat and basic nation management, adds a nice bit of spice to it all and serves as a welcome break from dungeon crawling, but without being so in-depth that it steals the show entirely.\n\nThe game its rough parts; some of the puzzle dungeons are rather long and sometimes unintuitive (but at least they tried -- more than I can say for most CRPGs these days), and balance is sometimes a little rough, with the early game being well on the difficult side but the late game descending into nukefests as your quadratic wizards two-shot bosses. And sometimes you will probably find yourself needing to consult a guide. But none of its flaws feels fatal to the overall game experience, at least to me.\n\nMy primary warning is that the game is [i]really big[/i] and some parts of it have quite a lot of combat, though it depends on where you are in the story. This is easily a 200 hour game, especially if you play in turn-based mode; don't go into it expecting anything less. Don't try to marathon your way through the game as fast as possible as you might for a 20-30 hour RPG or you will probably burn yourself out.

Having bought the game at a discount for $18 I have gotten far more than my money's worth and have only a few minor gripes so I give it a hearty thumbs up.\n\nPathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a standalone Pathfinder party RPG using D&D 3.5e rules, which aren't your grandpa's D&D rules and since I'm as old as your grandpa that means to me they are over-complicated with regards to the multitudes of classes, sub-classes, feats, non-stacking bonuses, and rules for what weapons and abilities can hit enemies.  You can play entirely in turn based combat mode which is what I'm doing.  I did the introductory part of the game 4 times, initially with the default Tower Shield specialized Fighter, and also with custom Rogue, Cleric, and Fighter characters.  The Tower Shield specialist was sort of a joke because I played for quite a while and never found a tower shield.  Eventually I went with a custom no subclass fighter, which so far feels like it was a good move because it lets my main character take point and be the focus of most battles while being fairly unkillable and doing decent damage.  Also if you look at the following you'll see that you won't get another strong melee character for a while after the first character who joins you.  Characters' classes who will join your party in order of appearance (as best as I recall and playing as a Lawful Good sort): Paladin (LG), Shaman (hidden alignment), Zen Archer (LN), Scoundrel (CN), Witch (NG), Oracle (NE), Wizard (N), Cleric (NG), Hellknight (LE).  I eventually got rid of the Oracle and the Scoundrel, neither of whom I would have used much in my party in any case, although there might have been other benefits if I'd kept them, for example the Hellknight character brings the ability to recruit Hellknight mercenaries for the crusade army which is the main reason I kept him although I have yet to bring him on any party adventures.  \n\nThe game is really 2 games in one, the party role playing game and the Fifth Crusade which is played out mostly separately on the world map although the two games intersect a lot, like your army camp could be attacked requiring your characters to defend it, or your party may not be able to get to certain quest areas until your crusader army clears enemy forts out of the way.  In general I don't care for this trend of having non-dungeon delving aspects to character RPG games (think Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity I) but since managing the Fifth Crusade hasn't been difficult up to this point I'm not too unhappy about it.  There is an option to let that run itself if you don't want to do it.\n\nI have run into a few fairly minor bugs and annoyances.  I'm going to call having a Tower Shield specialist as an available default selection in a game where tower shields don't drop a bug.  Often when casting healing spells the caster moves toward the target and loses the spell but the heal doesn't go off -- it's best to move into range manually before casting.  When changing melee weapons while in combat, the character who changed weapons gets an attack of opportunity which I believe is the opposite of what should happen - enemies in melee range should probably get an opportunity attack on the character who switched weapons.  As I mentioned before I think the combat rules are vastly over-complicated; I grew up with original D&D and AD&D first edition and to me that's about as complicated as it needed to be.  I much prefer the D&D 5th edition combat system in Solasta, for example.  It's also seriously annoying to me that my spell casters are mainly only useful for buffing the party since practically everything you run into will have high magic resistance and multiple immunities.  Thank the gods for Haste; my wizard memorizes it 5 times and works on a scroll every time we camp, otherwise I'd probably not continue playing.  Although the witch's hexes are sometimes effective and she is a great healer I eventually swapped her out in favor of the second cleric who can buff the entire party with Bless and Prayer and can cast heal spells by sacrificing memorized spells.  I have the shaman in my party too because she's the best lock picker but except for Bless and Protection spells she doesn't have great party buffs either so I mostly have her memorize healing spells.  But overall, at least so far, the good outweighs the bad by a large margin.  Another thing I like is that the moral dimension of decisions you make is pretty straightforward, not the muddled \"there is no Good option\" quandaries in many games of this sort.", "timestamp_created": 1694806844, "timestamp_updated": 1694806844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146348400": {"recommendationid": "146348400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042194328", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 8762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7516, "last_played": 1697145799}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than bear sex simulator", "timestamp_created": 1694799338, "timestamp_updated": 1694799338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507405459880828857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146333382": {"recommendationid": "146333382", "author": {"steamid": "76561199137957717", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 575, "playtime_at_review": 16352, "last_played": 1700422473}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is my fav TRPG sofar.", "timestamp_created": 1694782632, "timestamp_updated": 1694782632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146314314": {"recommendationid": "146314314", "author": {"steamid": "76561199161030815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1694740518}, "language": "english", "review": "Its cool", "timestamp_created": 1694748743, "timestamp_updated": 1694748743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146313810": {"recommendationid": "146313810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136434917", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 2316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2180, "last_played": 1694830956}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommended if you like deep and engaging systems and gameplay where your choices matter", "timestamp_created": 1694747765, "timestamp_updated": 1694747765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146299769": {"recommendationid": "146299769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091656854", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6674, "last_played": 1697211465}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the reason Baldur's Gate 3 is the 2nd greates CRPG of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1694723117, "timestamp_updated": 1694723117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146276762": {"recommendationid": "146276762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057015163", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 573, "last_played": 1687216801}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastic.

As a tabletop veteran, I was shocked at what encounters were being thrown at me. I was fairly frustrated going through the first few acts, surprised at what the game was throwing at me. But that difficulty is uncommon in most games these days, and what that difficulty does is force you to adapt and learn the game's systems, or continue to fail. Once I realized this, I stopped having such a bad time. I used my buffs properly. I used CC spells when they were needed, and gave my characters more options for ways to deal with problems that weren't just auto-attacking. \n\nThis game is extremely unforgiving for newcomers. Even hardened RPG veterans are going to find the Normal difficulty of this game to be a challenge. To any new players, I recommend you use the 3rd-level spells Heroism and Haste constantly with anyone who can cast them; these will carry you long enough to figure out builds. More than that, however, you should take your time. Spend an hour or two when leveling your characters, or more if you're just starting out. Really sink your teeth into this system, because the game expects you to do that on all but the lowest difficulties. \n\nThis is a very, very long RPG if played on turn-based instead of RtwP. However, that length allows for meaningful decisions that last hours and hours into the experience. I found the companions surprisingly enjoyable, and while not as good as Bioware's classics or New Vegas, there were a lot of very pleasant surprises in the writing. Moreover, it felt like the writing had a lot of heart, which is not something you see much anymore. \n\nThe Heroes of Might & Magic mode I think gets unfairly criticized by a lot of players, or by players who don't understand how Heroes of Might & Magic actually worked. It's not difficult, and it's not complicated, but what's fun about it is that your choice of Mythic Path actually affects which units you get, which is a really nice touch and makes me wonder what a strategy game with narrative choices affecting unit type would actually look like, and in that regard I think it's a great success even if the mode itself does get tedious by the end. \n\nDue to the length, and the payoffs of several plot threads over the course of the game, Wrath of the Righteous has been one of the most satisfying RPGs I've ever played. If you enjoy overcoming challenge with a deep system, and enjoy taking your time with games, this game will likely sit as highly in your list of favorites as it now does for me. So for anyone like me who enjoys deep systems and learning them with a game that rewards understanding those systems, I have not in over 18 years of gaming seen a better RPG and I could not recommend this game more for doing so much with so little resources to work with. \n\nAs for the BG3 comparison, well, that's a game that has a completely different design philosophy and caters to a different, less serious audience. But for me personally, I can't help but wish that games like WotR were the ones winning awards and selling in the millions instead, but I'm happy this game exists at all to cater for hardcore RPG fans who enjoy a game that pushes the player to the limit and then some while still having a great story and memorable characters.", "timestamp_created": 1694413408, "timestamp_updated": 1694413408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516245484352111816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146099250": {"recommendationid": "146099250", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994346562", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3037, "last_played": 1695001137}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just a poorly designed game.

Enemies do nothing but rush you or cast  1 repeatedly.  This is a game where you win fights over and over again and just think \"God, that was stupid, what was even the point of that\".  The game requires 1 skill to play it successfully: make or find a spreadsheet of all the buffs and the class needed to cast it, then you get those, then run in like I said earlier to see if you can A move the fight, if that fails, buff then you A move the fight.  If chance to hit is over 33% or more you will win, but you might need to heal.  If chance to hit is over 50% then just go take a nap because you'll walk all over everything.", "timestamp_created": 1694408754, "timestamp_updated": 1694998233, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435323834419250488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146096748": {"recommendationid": "146096748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055606142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21138, "last_played": 1697991794}, "language": "english", "review": "A masterpiece from start to finish.", "timestamp_created": 1694403798, "timestamp_updated": 1694403798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146073760": {"recommendationid": "146073760", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993750647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 12766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12658, "last_played": 1695240671}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid game, complicated, but in a good way.

WoTR has more classes, more build options AND more levels (20 or 40 levels in WoTR versus 12 levels in BG3) - one can really go crazy here.\n\nFor this same reason, the game may not be for everyone: it can be overwhelming and the learning curve can be really steep - especially if you are not familiar with the pathfinder rule-set.

I am actually changing this to recommended because once you get past some of the game's flaws, it is actually incredibly deep - perhaps just as much as BG3, albeit in different ways.  Some of those are subtle, but others are extreme.\n\nThis mostly has to do with the Mythic paths and how they evolve, and while some of them are barely reflected in the world, others massively alter playthroughs (Demon, Aeon, Swarm, and Lich being the obvious ones, but the most interesting is Legend).\n\nJust like the rest of the original review says (and I intend to leave it as-is), the game is ironically more loyal to the Baldur's Gate CRPG formula than BG3 is.  BG3 is still an amazing game, but I think once you are able to get past or through WotR's flaws, there is an incredible amount of writing there - especially if you can get into the Pathfinder lore.\n\nIt's not flashy, but I think this harkens back closer to a time where big effects and fully rendered 3d just simply didn't exist.  It requires you to read and imagine - but if you can get there, it actually goes far harder narratively than BG3 does, which is saying something.\n\nI feel somewhat bad that I know for a fact many won't be able to get through or over most of this game's flaws (and those of Kingmaker), but ironically this makes me want to go back and try Kingmaker again.  I know there were tons of fbugs on release - some I imagine are still around.  But still, I don't think it should outright discount or kill everything else good in the game.\n\n---\n\nUpdated Edit:  I put another 20+ hours into it in an effort to try and find something else redeemable and honestly it just made me want to play Pillars of Eternity 2 again to play a cRPG with less tedium.  The constant out of combat buffing, crusade campaign, overland travel requiring constant interruptions via resting - the whole thing is begging for mods to remove these \"mechanics\" or at least make them less anti-fun.\n\nSeriously if you found yourself looking back at cRPGs again after a good experience with BG3, just play Pillars.  Even Pillars 1 had more going for it than a game like this with 200 subclasses - only about 20 of which are really enjoyable or useful in this context.  Make no mistake that loads of those subclasses are fun, thematic, or useful in tabletop where they can shine - but this aint tabletop.\n\n---\n\nIf you picked this up out of curiosity after playing BG3 like me and felt that that the D&D 5e ruleset of that game was only really backstopped by all the little trinkets and 1d4 doodads they throw at you, then oh boy you're going to love Pathfinder, as it's roughly (without exaggeration) about three to four times as complex as 5e rules.\n\nIronically this game is more like Baldur's Gate (the originals) than BG3, and BG3 is way closer to Divinity 3, just with a D&D skin.  Doesn't make it bad - but it does make this game closer to the original formula.\n\nHowever while there's some good parts to that formula, there are some awful ones as well.  Some areas of the original BG were pure crawl.  Furthermore you essentially came to rely on a few key and universally useful buffs like haste or otherwise to make it through once you could pick them up.  BG3 has haste, but it's far toned down and comes with its own risks.\n\nPathfinder however and especially this game does not deal in an ability range even remotely as mundane as BG3 and the typical tabletop campaign.  This is extremely epic scale to the point you're battling arch-demons and essentially gods while effectively becoming one or attaining godlike power.  What it means is that your modifiers begin to get utterly obscene.  AC 25 in D&D might be considered high.  AC 25 in Pathfinder might as well be a sitting duck.\n\nI've played a lot of the original BG, and more recently all through BG3, and more importantly a game far closer to this (and BG) which is Pillars of Eternity.  Pillars has its own formula though and what Pillars gets right is having a lot of short-duration, in-combat status effects (both buffs and debuffs) and very little if any hard CC.  This game all but forces you to go through the motions of applying quite literally a dozen or more pre-buffs before wading into combat and praying the dice don't go against you.  To reach that magical AC 30, 40, etc...it's all done is increments of 1, 2, and 3 mostly.  Same with attack, saves, etc.  It's all just a litany of baby steps.\n\nThat's probably the most insufferable part aside from the omegabloat of the classes and feats thrown at you.  It's definitely Pathfinder alright.  It's got all the hallmarks of why people who don't like Pathfinder as a system don't like it, ie: the extreme granular complexity of everything.\n\nParts of the game are good.  The soundtrack is good until it gets old (they all do, so not a slight, but it's lacking a little variety).  Some of the graphics are ok, but it's lacking detail in some of the models for sure.  But more than anything else, the system just sticks out like a sore thumb.  More than the grand story, the epic power scale, the characters, range of both evil and good choices - the system will have you pulling your hair out or slamming the difficulty slider down when a PC with a dozen buffs gets instantly dirtnapped by something that has 6 attacks a round and lands a few crits.\n\nI mean it's definitely better than Kingmaker.  But lmao that's not saying much honestly...\n\nPass unless you really like cRPGs or you know what you're getting into with the ruleset.", "timestamp_created": 1694332854, "timestamp_updated": 1695334581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146031870": {"recommendationid": "146031870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031906321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 11856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9242, "last_played": 1694980337}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a very deep, well-constructed old school RPG.

I say this due to clear improvement I can see that has occurred between Kingmaker and Wraith of the Righteous (WoTR).  The story still has a time pressure and stakes but has lost those hard lose situations that where evident in Kingmaker as well as having a massively improved and interesting cast of characters.\nThe game has a vast amount of player choice. While any options are \u201climited\u201d to the classic alignment grid and so many people playing of one set alignment are simply going to pick whatever coincides with theirs, if one is truly trying to role-play a complex character it can result in some very interesting situations.\nThe characters that one meets within WoTR are also very interesting.  There are duds who fall flat, but for the most part even the characters whose personalities went against mine in most playthroughs still had enough motivation to keep me invested in their character and aware of their views.\nThe game, while deep, does run into the problem of front ended complexity very quickly.  Path of Exile comes to mind with its labyrinthine skill trees and while skill-wise WoTR is simpler it is even more front ended with its character creation.  \u201cWhat race?\u201d, \u201cWhat class?\u201d, \u201cShould I pick a subclass or not?\u201d, \u201cDoes my deity matter?\u201d and more which can lead to many players dropping the game before even getting involved.  Even after character creation when levelling or equipment selection this problem continues to show itself.  I was in many ways lucky that I stuck it out, but many would not be wrong for simply leaving after that feeling of being overwhelmed took them over.  To the games credit it does try and solve this problem by allowing for auto-levelling and pre-generated characters, but I cannot help but feel this does not help explain to the potential players how to actually work with the system, instead hoping through practical usage that the player will learn how to play.\nAn interesting addition to the game is its downloadable content (DLC) which, while it does add more content, does not really added to the overall game as a whole.  In some ways one could consider this a good thing, \u201cJust buy the base game and you\u2019re set!\u201d, but then my question would be why did they bother to release the DLC in the first place?  I think the problem with a lot of the DLC is it mainly distracts from the overarching story and so unless you really like learning more about the lore, I cannot really recommend whaling on this one.\nWith the paragraph lengths above as a guide it may appear that I am down on the game, and while it does have its floors, the fact that I could play the game for as long as I did and still come out feeling largely positive about the world, mechanics and characters indicates to me that the game itself does indeed deserve the attention of those that liked the TTRPG version or even TTRPGs in general seeing as it does play very much like one except in when you hit on party member in the game there is less likelihood of you being booted from the table.\nPros:\n\u2022\tCharacters and deep and likeable.\n\u2022\tThe story is interesting and diverse.\n\u2022\tThe mechanics can allow for a lot of skill testing and satisfaction.\nCons:\n\u2022\tThe DLC is rather redundant.\n\u2022\tThe game struggles to explain itself properly.\n", "timestamp_created": 1694179409, "timestamp_updated": 1694179409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145909968": {"recommendationid": "145909968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040418520", "num_games_owned": 1684, "num_reviews": 253, "playtime_forever": 2213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2160, "last_played": 1694518730}, "language": "english", "review": "While the games inherent systems may be very in depth, the visual quality, portrayal of the story, largely forgettable soundtrack, (mostly) stale voice acting/lack thereof and outdated gameplay of Pathfinder resulted, for me, in a game that was ultimately not that enjoyable.\n\nI genuinely tried not to let these issues bother me and play purely for the combat itself but alas I could not do it. Despite systems that invite replayability and experimentation, I just felt no urge to actually do that. The combat did not grip me in a way that something like Divinity Original Sin series or Baldurs Gate 3 did. Fights in this game feel like a blur to me, spells do not have the 'oomph' you'd expect them to have and due to that combat ends up feeling tacky and often unresponsive. I thought turn based mode might improve the overall feel of the game but all it did was make it unbearably slow. Slower paced combat is totally fine as BG3 has proven, but only if the combat itself is fun and impactful.\n\nThe story itself was, disappointingly, not fully voiced which made the game feel yet more jarring and constantly tore me from my immersion. Some of it is excellent but a large portion of it was simply immersion breaking due to either weak writing or out of place dialogue. Why is my medieval paladin companion using words such as, \"instantaneously\", or complaining loudly when finding loot? Why is half of the tutorial not voiced? Not to mention dialogue in places feels very straight up rushed, like somebody wrote it offhandedly and without effort. That said, some of the dialogue I'll gladly admit was really excellent which makes it clear that the game had multiple writers. Sadly, the good dialogue just makes the fact that the rest of the game is so average that much more disappointing.\n\nAnd then there's the Crusade mode. Crusade mode is an interesting concept that should have, in my opinion, been scrapped early in development. It is basically a really boring minigame that comes at you out of nowhere in Act 2 of the game. It's not a fun minigame either, it is really straight forward and repetitive and is very clearly designed to inflate playtime. Instead of this system even being added, a stricter focus on adding story, choices and RPG mechanics would've made this game far more enjoyable to play. \n\nOverall a good attempt at a modern CRPG but drops the ball in some ways that are really important to players like myself. If there is to be another Pathfinder game that promises improvements on the core systems of this game, in particular the battle system, I'd be interested to try it.", "timestamp_created": 1694176808, "timestamp_updated": 1694468010, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543306112289428711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145895921": {"recommendationid": "145895921", "author": {"steamid": "76561199393211841", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 8726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8726, "last_played": 1694145559}, "language": "english", "review": "the game is too long and full of choices. really good interaction with the romance options too, i've tried with all the male companions and loved each one's romance story <3  the villains aren't one dimensional at all... you could actually sympathize with a lot of them.. i've got an ending that i really liked. the game is really worth playing", "timestamp_created": 1694153657, "timestamp_updated": 1694153657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145878264": {"recommendationid": "145878264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141225445", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1695848541}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1694124121, "timestamp_updated": 1694124121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145845783": {"recommendationid": "145845783", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971815770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1700626608}, "language": "english", "review": "A great transistion for BG3 with a whole lot of depth.

I know that I will continue this game despite all of these things, but this game has burnt me out so much that I think I'm gonna take a short break from the genre as a whole. \nMy major issues:\nCombat - \nTurn based combat was heavily shafted. There is very little in the realm of tactics here, which is astounding, considering just how much Pathfinder itself is geared towards allowing tactical combat encounters. It is Very Clear that this game was made with real-time with pause combat in mind, else there wouldn't be so, so many of the same trash fights over and over again. It gets very stale, very fast.\nEncounters really just boil down to numbers in this game more than I've seen in many other games. I've played Baldurs gate 1, 3, icewind dale, DoS2, and this. This game is the only one where I feel that basically no matter how many items or consumables they throw at me, nothing will ever feel strong on its own. I'm not sure what the problem is here, if I'm being honest. I can think of a couple ideas, like half of the enemies in the game having Very annoyingly high spell resistances. But that isn't ever the whole picture. Sure, I can mage armor, barkskin, bless, shield, all I want, and doing all that only leads me to being basically on-par with what the game expects me to be at, on Normal difficulty. I like my spell slots being used as resources in situations where they're necessary. Mage armor lasts a long time, so that one is an exception, but the fact that you are expected to have all your buffs on all the time with no regards for what resources you might want to conserve for later on in a dungeon feels.. really unfun to me. I'm aware that others feel differently and no one is wrong to disagree with me. I've respec'd my characters numerous times too, to see if something would click or feel different, but ultimately I've found that regardless of the build or spell name, it doesn't really change how the game flows for me. Sure, lots of builds, but they all feel very similar to me.\n\nWorld - \nThe world feels so un-interactable and it really puts a damper on my perception of things around me. No, I don't need every random NPC to have unique dialogue or anything like that. It is quite literally about the world itself, boxes, trees, doors, nothing is destructible or intractable unless it is specifically programmed to be, like a chest, or a hidden passage. There aren't really any dangerous surfaces or anything like that. It all feels so sterile to me. \n\nCharacters - \nWhile many of them are quite good, it is somewhat hard for me to like a lot of them on more than a surface level. The only one that I would say I truly like is Wenduag. I think my big issue here is that you can never try to ask them more about themselves in an ongoing manner. All you get is a big exposition of backstory, which I often struggled to care about, and then the characters chime in in dialogue with other characters either while resting or questing. What are the hooks to draw players in to these characters? Even when they DO chime in on things, there isn't really any development to be had. Everyone feels so one-note, at least at the start of Act 3 they still do.\n\nPuzzles -\nThe most unfun puzzles I have ever done in video games. I'm usually stubborn about sticking to a puzzle until I finish it in games, but the ones in this game are absolutely horrendous. They're confusing, nonsensical, and even when you DO know what you're doing, it somehow still manages to be a chore! (Looking at you, Drezen puzzle.) It would be a BIT better if these puzzles had decent interfaces to them, but no, not at all. They're as unfun to interact with as they are to solve. \n\nI'm not really one to complain about graphics or anything cause again, budget, but for me this game's art style is.. not very pleasing on the eyes.\n\nVoices are hit or miss. Some characters' voices like wenduag, staunton, and minagho, to name a few, are always good. But then you have others like Lann or Woljif whose voices often make me laugh due to how corny the performances are. \"Stab you or zap you? Why not both?\" Though at least in Woljif's case, his lines don't do him any favors. \n\nI don't recommend this game unless you know exactly what you're getting into here. If using all of your abilities to break even on the vast majority of combat encounters in real time combat is fun to you, then by all means, have at it. \nIt isn't for me, tho I still plan to finish it at least once.", "timestamp_created": 1693889364, "timestamp_updated": 1693889469, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692418813705444336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145692054": {"recommendationid": "145692054", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988681850", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6823, "last_played": 1693847357}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty gewd", "timestamp_created": 1693888953, "timestamp_updated": 1693888953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145689887": {"recommendationid": "145689887", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976694645", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 635, "playtime_at_review": 2096, "last_played": 1700712707}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best CRPGs I've played in a long time.

There are 25 base classes, and if you count the archetypes and prestige classes too, this number goes over 200, and when you add mythic paths into equation... Replayability of this game is staggering.\n- A compelling story with some choices, mostly dependent on your mythic path.\n- A crusade mechanic for fans of HoMM series, fun and rewarding, although simplistic in nature (just outnumber everything and hit first)\n- Flexible difficulty levels that can fit players of any experience.\n- QoL features (I'm looking at you, Baldur's Gate 3), skill trees, shared backpacks, all that stuff\n\nCons:\n- Very beginner unfriendly due to complexity of the system and it starts at the character creation, it's daunting at first and you can spend an hour or two just creating your first character.\n- Very demon-centric adventure: 85% of your enemies are chaotic evil, and 85% of those are demons, so it heavily favors some classes (like paladins and ranger demonslayers) while making others completely useless (like assassins), same for spells\n\nOverall, a great game, a must-play for fans of the genre, 8.5/10\n\nP.S.

I got bored of the crusade battles. Both of these problems were solved by difficulty settings and save editing and what was left was one of the most fun and engaging RPGs I've ever played. \n\nI open up with that because I quit the game in Act 3, three separate times. And if I left it there I would've missed out on an incredible story with pretty much unrivalled freedom to shape it with your choices. So if you're here for that, for the characters and story, it's there and you'll be hard pressed to find better, so if some mechanic is preventing you from enjoying that just get rid of it.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. The combat in this game is good, but it demands a lot from you. That you prepare for each encounter, that you have a good understanding of what each of the stats mean, that you keep applying buffs and using items. And that would be fine, if it weren't so common. The game seems to be designed with realtime with pause in mind, not turn based. If you play the latter you will spend dozens of hours more on the same encounters and some places may begin to feel like WoW dungeons, with hordes of trash mobs you can't avoid or talk your way out of. That said, if you enjoy realtime combat, you may have a completely different experience.\n\nOn the crusade management side things can get pretty interesting with the council decisions you make, your companions acting as advisors. The army battles and construction... I kind of wish they weren't there. Most of the aforementioned council decisions relate to those systems (ie. you get new units, they get buffs, you get access to buildings etc.). Which is impressive to see but I'd much rather have story implications for say, recruiting outlaws and deranged people than actually seeing a unit called \"outlaws\" on a HOMM-like battle.\n\nAll criticisms aside, I can't recommend this game enough.

Or you could just be an absolute, unabashed, flagrant asshole to everyone; that\u2019s an option. Not a very *good* or *fun* option, but it *is* an option. But why would you do that? \n\n\u2014Thanks to the maddening, archaic, mysterious, near-obtuse nature of the 1st edition Pathfinder RPG system (seriously, you need to sacrifice an entire orphan in order even understand the combat system when playing on the tabletop), you can customize your character builds and are actually encouraged to experiment without remorse nor serious impediment throughout the game (unlike in games in the Soulsbourne genre where choice is an illusion, experimentation with your build is actively punished, and fun is not allowed\u2026which, come to think of it, is every game in the Soulsbourne genre). And not just your main character, either; you can experiment with tweaking your companions\u2019 builds, too! It\u2019s like they took all the criticisms they got from Kingmaker and actually listened! Finally, I can unlock even more synergistic aspects of my party, allowing me to bust out truly cracked and twisted combinations (like say, having one companion create a giant pit underneath a group enemies and then get another to chuck the Mother of All Fireballs at said pit, or have one character paralyze a boss monster *with the power of comedy* while another is busy getting group heals off)! \n\n\u2014There are puzzles you actually have to look up guides for! Combat encounters that require extensive planning but can also be improvised! Gear that isn\u2019t as integral to making good builds but pulls its weight! Various NPCs to sell things to and buy things from! Turn-based army vs army battles that harken back to the Heroes of Might and Magic series! *A LONELY OLD ELF MAN WHO IS IN NEED OF RANDOM THINGS SO HE CAN LOREDUMP ON YOU (and is possibly also in dire need of hugs, a blanket, and a nap)!* Dear GOD, I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of this game! The mad folks of Owlcat have struck PAYDIRT with this! It\u2019s certainly got me excited for their Rogue Trader project! \n\n\u2014And the soundtrack SLAPS. Give whoever made the soundtrack a HUGE raise, please! I love it! \n\nIf you\u2019re stuck between having to choose between buying BG3 and buying this game? Make it this game, especially if it\u2019s on sale (I got my copy at around a 60 - 70% discount, plus the DLC and the deluxe edition at around that same discount). Hell, splurge for that deluxe upgrade and the season passes; it\u2019s very much worth and only ~$30 USD more (unless you\u2019re getting all that at a discount, which means you\u2019re getting a better deal)! \n\nIf, when I finally do get to buy it (hopefully on a deep sale; gimme that 80-90% discount!), BG3 can match THIS?

Build variety goes out the window. The buffs expire after mere minutes, so you need to reapply them before each combat.

Same goes with leveling: feats and new abilities don't really make you more powerful so much as they just make you viable. I was told it's normal to be on the weak side as a spellcaster early on (I played as a wizard) because you'd get powerful later. That never really happened; despite mythic feats, fancy items and abilities and high spell penetration, my spells were still doing close to nothing, especially compared to Lann or Woljif whose auto-attacks did a lot more than my limited-use Hellfire Ray. There also isn't generally much strategy to even think about, with cutscenes forcing your party into the right position to get AoEd upon as soon as the scene ends. It's just as bad when the AI decides to walk past three of my party members, incurring attacks of opportunity on the way, just to get to my squishy wizard and one-shot her, making positionig feel entirely irrelevant.\n\nThe game prides itself on the highly customisable difficulty, but the reality is that Normal difficulty tends to feature sudden impossible-feeling difficulty spikes, while Casual difficulty makes things way too trivial. I'll never forgive the game that forced me to switch to Casual because I couldn't get past a random encounter on the road.\n\nThe game is true to the Pathfinder system, but that's pretty much where all the problems stem from because it's not a good video game adaptation. What they've managed to do by keeping it accurate to the TTRPG is essentially implemeting a merciless GM who's always out to get you. \n\nPadding for time is a huge downside I couldn't help but keep noticing, the game really overstayed its welcome around Act 3 and feels like it insists on wasting your time.  Buffing is a frustrating 10 minute experience every time I enter a zone, and the fact a mod fixes that issue doesn't make me think any better of the game design. Exploration in the world map isn't really a fun kind of exploration, mostly forcing you to stop and rest after taking a few steps whenever you try to get anywhere - I appreciate immersion but it gets old quicker than you get Teleportation Circles. Crusader Mode isn't really for anyone but I enjoyed it, but it's also another time-filler and gets in the way when you really just want to progress the game. And there are story elements that also pad for time, like how some companion stories start in Act 2, 3 or 4 but don't get resolved until Act 5 with nothing inbetween - a whole total of two quests for the entire companion story. The game forces you to wait so long to resolve it that by the time you do get to Act 5, often 100 hours later, you might have forgotten what the story was even about to begin with - who was Savamelek again? It doesn't help that at the start of Act 3 you are bombarded with new quests and NPCs and information that in a first playthrough I really struggled to keep track of what was going on at one point. Combat also tends to take forever, which is something I'd be alright with, missing attacks is a normal RPG experience, but, even fully buffed, I've had encounters where for nearly 20 minutes the enemies and my characters would constantly miss each another. I don't know in what universe that's considered fun gameplay.\n\nOverall the plot and story are GREAT, it's what kept me going, but I can't get over how unlikeable the companions are. And not just one or two of them - almost all of them. Arue is the only one I genuinely liked from start to finish. Lann was my ironic favourite for a time simply because of how inoffensive he was compared to everyone else. Even during camping, where companion banter happens, they were always so spiteful to one another that it made me wonder how a party like that was managing to work together in the first place. I'd forgive Regill because of where he came from, but it still adds him to the count. Daeran is a complete donkey to you from start to finish; Camellia starts out really cool, I was actually really excited to unravel the mystery surrounding her character, until I found out that nothing you do actually matters and she always turns out the same at the end; Ember is the GM's girlfriend, pulling off things that the lore shouldn't easily support (Arue's story is an example of that, she is a very specific exception) and getting away with them, then those things are never addressed or acknowledged by anyone outside her questline; Sosiel is self-absorbed; Seelah might as well be made out of cardboard; Woljif is an irredeemable criminal; Nenio is annoying and not as charming as the devs thought (though she becomes likeable after you finish her story - IF you finish her story, given the crapton of nonsensical puzzles you have to go through). They don't really get better as you progress their stories and get to know them better either. Ironically, for such an amount of time padding, you don't actually get that many new interactions with your companions throughout the game - I made sure to visit them every time I was back in town to see whether they would comment on recent events, and they never did.\n\nThe character creation was really fun, even if I think it's not always a good thing to have that many classes and sub-classes - the difference between some is miniscule and spellcasters still end up as crossbowmen anyway. I also really enjoyed mythic paths, even if I did go for Aeon and then swapped to a Legend because I didn't like being emotionlessly neutral. I'd try Azata on a future run.\n\nMaybe I'll give the game another go in a year or so, but at the moment it feels like a single playthrough was enough for me.", "timestamp_created": 1693405973, "timestamp_updated": 1693405973, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536763846874237061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145299745": {"recommendationid": "145299745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295920656", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1694873398}, "language": "english", "review": "I am quite surprised how well this game runs on my laptop, the loading times are fairly fast, graphic wise not much to complain as this is not action 3rd person or 1st person game.

Most of the mythic paths feel like a job rather than a goal or a fun bit of flavor. Additionally, the abundance of mythic paths kind of give you a inaccurate impression of how much roleplay freedom you have, which is to say you often have the choices of good, bad, I don't care, and \"I'm bored. I'm gonna kill you!\" (this one and bad often end up being combined). Additionally, for an RPG, it sure does lock you out of almost literally everything unless you follow a guide. I know its folly to try to look up guides without being spoiled on countless things you didn't even know about, but there was no other way to play the game in any fulfilling way, and every single guide in existence talking about the \"!!SECRET ENDING!!\" gets pretty old, not gonna lie, especially with the fact that so many, let's be honest, stupidly pointless and meaningless decisions are vital to reaching it.\n\nAnd good luck trying to do anything at all on purpose. I've played three different playthroughs now attempting to romance one character and have failed all times because of such random things such as: a secret statue you have to jerk off to, a song you have to sing at a very specific point in time (the option to do so requiring several previous actions to have been done as well), letting someone out of jail instead of letting them out of jail and also calling them hot, and who knows what else, since not only is the secret ending that everyone advertises on every given piece of material they have ever written about the game such a driving point, but apparently you have to follow a guide down to the letter to be able to fuck who you want to fuck. I seriously have to rest in specific places that have no logical reason for resting in in order to progress romances with people? What even is this? Frankly I'm getting tired of restarting in order to directly and purposefully complete any of the goals I set. Everything I accomplish is purely by accident. I could play this game ten times all the way through and still fumble my way through it blindly. While that might sound nice since you discover new things every playthrough, it's very much offset by the fact that you [i]can't do anything you want to do[/i] without reading multi-page instruction manual. I'm honestly concerned about what bull the game is going to throw at me later that makes all my choices either meaningless or makes meaningless choices decide the fate of the whole world or something.\n\nFrankly, I'm going to have to take a break from this game for a little while. I'm tired of playing through three acts before realizing I've locked myself out of something eight hours ago by waving at someone instead of fist bumping them or having mac & cheese instead of spaghetti.

I, Kiba Snowpaw, have journeyed through digital realms far and wide, but none have captivated my furry heart quite like \"Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition.\" This is not just a game; it's an odyssey of mythical proportions, blending epic battles with moral conundrums.\n\n[h2]A Tale of Demons and Destiny[/h2]\nAs I embarked on this journey to the Worldwound, it was like tracking through the treacherous blizzards of HowlStrom. Facing demons and choosing paths of virtue or vice, I felt like a true mythical hero - part wolf, part legend.\n\n[h2]Gameplay - A Wolf's Challenge[/h2]\nNavigating this RPG as a character of my own creation was like hunting in the great wilds of HowlStrom. With a plethora of classes, races, spells, and abilities, I tailored my hero to be as unique as the snowflakes in my homeland. And the consequences of every choice? As impactful as an avalanche!\n\n[h2]Combat and Strategy[/h2]\nBattling through hordes of demonic foes in real-time or turn-based combat was a thrill akin to a midnight hunt under a full moon. Utilizing advanced combat maneuvers, I felt like the alpha of the pack, leading my furry companions to glorious victory.\n\n[h2]Companions and Crusade[/h2]\nMy party, a band of more than 10 unique companions, became my pack.

From celestial Angel to raging Demon, each path offered extraordinary abilities that shaped not just my character, but the very world around us.\n\n[h2]Mature Content - A Wolf's Warning[/h2]\nBeware, fellow adventurers!

The game itself divides on a role mechanic and a tactical mechanic. \nThe role phase is like most games: create a character, set off to adventures building up a party to fight against the problems of the land. \nThe tactical phase is set on some chapters of the game. It allows to you recruit units, build,  and guide an army, setting you on a conquerors path around the Worldwound lands against daemons that pour from the Abyss. This phase is set on a map board, while the battles are set on a grid map (compared by many with those battle maps and mechanics from the New World Computing\u00b4s Heroes of Might and Magic franchise (more work on this part could probably help, though it is a fine add for my opinion)).\n\nThe game itself is quite long and shows much love from the developers team.\nIt brings 25 classes, 167 sub classes, and 13 prestige classes; bringing so many choices to the player to customize their dreamt hero. Adding to this, they set one of the most extensive list of playable races of all RPG... 12 races (even half vampires) and 21 bloodlines/backgrounds (adding abilities from such races, and even the chance to shapeshift in  such forms) that range from celestials to serpentines along with undead, elementals, fey, dragons and others. Including the DLC Last Sarkorian (already included above in the count), the developers  give special love to those that like shapeshifting; giving the chance to the player to shapeshift between many forms like: elementals, sabertooth tigers, manticores, hydras, dragons, ankous, wyverns and others. \n\nA second grand boost is given to the customization of the party as the game have a second profession tree labeled as Mythic path. Such path brings to the player the chance to play as a major beign in the game, giving the chance to play as 10 mythical creatures  or a legendary hero. Such creatures bring a new perspective to the game story, each adding their own abilities, visual city customization, companions, special army units and abilities; some also bring special locations (able only to them), and special interactions with  characters along the story...\nDid you feel out of context some situations in role games, for example when you played as a necromancer and those lesser undead still fight you?...no more as a lich you may controll them while other professions need to fight them...\nwhat about playing as some nature lover, but been unable to restore some death/corrupted lands, say no more as an azata you have such power (not in many places, but still worth it)...\na killer frenzy was no possible in other games?, become the swarm that walk and feed on everyone; such innovative ways to interact in the game were only possible on board and paper, well this game brings some of those into the game and allow you to feel more connected with your choices, you character and the way you want to role-play...oh and check on those finishing moves, severing the body of your enemies, looks great adds a lot.\nAround 10 mythical paths to choose, angel, devil, daemon, lich, gold dragon, and others; each with their own abilities and summons. \n\nMany levels to customizr your own character: 20 levels of professions, single or multiclassed, 10 levels of mythical creature, 40 levels as a legendary hero. \n\nAbout gameplay:\nThe game itself require a lot of reading, need to prepare before \"venturing forth\", as the game itself could prove difficult if one mess with the build of the character. Luckily, you may check one the class progression to see what abilities come with each level, so you may pre-plan how you are gonna spend your levels.\nThe game allow you to have pregenerated characters to join your party (need to recruit them as mercenaries) or pregenerated ones, each with their own story. Regretably, while i find the story amazing and quite enjoyable, the companions are a drawback. They are average, only their conversation their chapter quest have some meaning; their conversation (via resting) is superficial at most, having no further consequences even if they fought about something. Eventhough, some of your decisions may end up in ending your relation with you companions.\nSome optional choices that are linked to the alignament are not approved by all the players, i myself found some of the alignament situation failing at showing  how such an aligned character should approach the situation.\nSome builds may need knowledge of the items that are in the game, as some items are to be make by players choices, as you craft some items from previous ones, but you do not know the attributes of such item until its final creation stage. On the bright side, there is a chance to rebuild you character in-game, just be sure that the initial difficulty settings allow it.\nPlenty of items to choose from, plenty on interactions,  plenty of customization for your run, but you may find the game hard, at least until one understands the mechanics (and even there there are some hard encounters).\n\nFinal words...\nThe community is quite helpful, and the developers roam through the forum from time to time.\nWhile the game is excelent, my thought, there are still some minor bugs.\nEvery time the developers release a patch, they fix some things, and break a bunch of others (EVERYTIME, no misses).\nThe product is among the very best of the genre, an AAA game; many options, high replayability, you may create the very character you want ()plenty of customization options, and plenty of paths). Several difficulty settings to choose from, and several youtube streamers with hints that may help you out. \nThe price is adequate, and you may find it on sales with very good offers; the DLC are no needed, still perhpas i would recommend Last Sarkorian to add some options for the character creation and a new partner to join your adventurers.\nRegretably, this awesome masterpiece is linked to spme very negative situations: first and foremost developers try to change the licence agreement after many copies were sold, with no option (at that moment, before they reverse their doings) but to accept; a move that made my trust in the developers and my ability to keep what i bought, dangling on a rope. In the same movement, they tried to bring a program along with a patch, that takes information from your system for marketing purposes; at that moment, the user\u00b4s opinion about  a non game resources force into their PC were not required by the developers...the situation backlashed and they had to restore the previous settings, yet the move brings up some distrust about how they behave with their community. Nontheless, this was their only \"bad\" move, as they always have a good communication with the community. \n\nIf you like role playing games go for this game, yet, first check on the tactical mechanic as it is no evreyone cup of tea. \n\nHope this help\nHave fun \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1692896676, "timestamp_updated": 1694543428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144930127": {"recommendationid": "144930127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043870857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 267, "playtime_at_review": 20879, "last_played": 1700773345}, "language": "english", "review": "still the best CRPG since BG2 till today", "timestamp_created": 1692896363, "timestamp_updated": 1692896363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475553244352340698", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144928375": {"recommendationid": "144928375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095581847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25101, "last_played": 1697742457}, "language": "english", "review": "The amount of player choice and content this game offers is staggering.

But i really think it is the true heir of the original Baldur's Gate era! Baldur's Gate 3 is really good. But i'm not really feeling nostalgic of old Baldur's Gate when playing it.

In a game like bauldur's gate 3, I can strategically stack the deck to account for my lack of luck, but I consistently get crit and wiped out by things in small number below my level, despite the amount of stat-stacking and prep work I do I was playing normal. I play an optimal build, but it doesn't matter. This is a good game, but bear in mind you might bounce off of it. No shame in that.\n\nFinal(?) Positive Review (~70 hrs):\n\nMy Close Friend and confidant told me to just affix the difficulty: eg. drop the DC's. There's a whole suite of options to bring the checks to be closer in line with my dice roll expectation. I had to get over my own personal hurdles regarding low-difficulty options being tied to my worth as a gamer, and you know what, I feel better now. I'm enjoying the game.

I've run games, I've played in games. I'm *extremely* experienced in playing Pathfinder 1e, so I know know the system inside and out. I literally used to build Pathfinder 1e monsters from the ground up as a hobby, have built my own campaign setting from the ground up *twice*, and have put together the equivalent of perhaps 3 full adventure paths worth of raw game material in my career as a GM. \n\nFrom that point of view: some of the boneheaded decisions made by Owlcat in this game hurt my soul.\n\nThe pathfinding is terrible (unless you pause the game and super carefully micromanage what the character does, move by move, they will ALWAYS pathfind into the trap, for example, even after it's revealed. This is something the original Neverwinter Nights, over a decade ago, had solved), the method of controlling your characters is unintuitive as all hell (I cannot tell you how many times I've tried to use a consumable but ended up using it incorrectly, wasting it), and the dungeon design in the beginning is literally some of the worst examples of what *NOT* to do if you want to be a successful GM - both in terms of challenge, and of making the encounters interesting.\n\nThis is like playing an extremely boring version of Neverwinter Nights that's trying to be Xcom, and was programmed by a bunch of amateurs, and released in beta as a full game. I've made it as far as the scene where the dwarf and the faceless demon lady were bantering back and forth, and that was when I decided to plow through with a build specifically designed to just burst down everything I came across (for those who don't know - burst damage builds in low level Pathfinder 1e are unfair in terms of how good they are, and will typically chew through any encounter that doesn't involve your GM throwing non-standard tactics at you), and just decided that the story was flat out boring and quit.\n\nLike, I'm familiar with the actual AP Wrath of the Righteous to an extent - mostly the Iomedae controversy later on in the AP - and it's not one I would normally run or want to participate in because it's kind of lame, so this doesn't really surprise me, but I am disappointed.\n\nIf Owlcat make another one of these, they should do Carrion Crown, Iron Gods, or Tyrant's Grasp.

Buy on sale and never have buyer's remorse.  This is one of the longest rpgs that I have ever played story wise.  As someone new to pathfinder, I think WOTR is amazing in almost every aspect, and exceeded my expectations in most areas. Main story is incredible and deep.  Story companions are well developed and interesting.  Combat is well designed and enjoyable in both real time and turn based modes - try both. Boss fights are generally smoother in turn based, but it's also more satisfying to roll over a mega boss in real time.  Character customization is the biggest pro of this game.  Build options are incredible and very complex.  You don't really have to worry about min/maxing outside of higher difficulties.  I do recommend playing on Core+ or custom just to be able to build your companions to your liking.  Not all auto leveled builds are terrible, but you can certainly build better allies with personal customization. \n\nI have to say that I don't get all the hate against crusade mode that I've read in reviews.  It's a fun game within the game, and it's not overly complex and most importantly provides alot of great weapons, armor, and accessories that can be obtained at the start of chapter 3.  I enjoy crusade mode and find it's a good change of pace from party combat. \n\nThere remain a few balance issues with this game combat wise but a well built party can overcome almost anything.  There are some fights on Unfair that feel very unfair.  All the puzzles are bad. Not good at all unfortunately.  Puzzle mini-games are not intuitive at all and provide almost no direction within the game as to the logic of solving them.  There is, technically, a logic to them; however, it is so cryptic that you will probably solve the puzzle with trial and error (not easily) far before you are able to deduce the logic behind the puzzle itself.

The only gripe I have it is that the some skills dont feel impactful. In fact, most of them are. It's a small thing but can ruin the immersion sometimes when you have dos2 which had a very satisfying animations. The already top-notch class system is made infinitely better when you pair that with multiple godlike power pathways. You can be dragon, a nymph, a lich etc. And the progression you get out of these godlike powers are not even mediocre.

If you enjoyed Kingmaker, you are the perfect candidate to enjoy this game also.\n\nIf you are a player looking for an RPG with a great story, companions and easy to understand mechanics with the playtime of about 30-50 hours [i](think Dragon Age Origins, as I was)[/i], then I BEG YOU look elsewhere. I will try to explain why.\n\nIn short, I would describe this game with these words: verbose, exhausting and micromanagement. \n\nThe game has a steam completion rate [i](based on the ending achievement)[/i] of 11.6% [i](at the time of me writing this review)[/i]. That is an incredibly low rate for a game that has been out for almost 2 years now. I suspect the reason for this to be the sheer amount of content in this game, most of which will involve travelling, combat, or listening to the life story of literally every character that speaks to you. I am not surprised that the way the game handled those elements would turn exhausting to most players.  \n\nTo satisfyingly complete this game, you will have to put in about 70-90 hours [i](non-turn based combat, story difficulty)[/i] // 150-200 hours [i](turn based combat, medium difficulty and above)[/i]. There are SO many encounters in this game [i](and some of them quite challenging, but not mechanics-wise but luck-wise, which is as bad of a decision by the devs as it was in Kingmaker)[/i], you WILL spend half of your playthrough in combat. And even if you play on story difficulty, the travelling time and crusade management pads out the time way too much. This is a game that should have been 40-60 hours long but ended up padded out to the extreme. \n\nIt proved way too exhausting for me altogether - I resorted to skipping through most of the dialogue that didn't pertain to the companions and the main story - but I am certain that a player who is ready for a big world to dive into could find this a great, possibly the best RPG they'll ever play.\n\n[h2]The infuriating:[/h2]\n[list]\n    [*]Endless, pointlessly time consuming, and sometimes needlessly overpowered enemy encounters\n    [*]The size of the map forces you to spend a long time travelling it, which then forces you to rest every 10 seconds. This issue is partially remedied by conditional teleportation, which is not available until about halfway through the game and must be deliberately set up by the player\n    [*]Overbearingly verbose conversations. One review I read described this thus: \"The telling of the story feels like it is orchestrated by a DM that loves listening to their own voice.\" I often felt that the dialogue writers failed to make a point without creating an unnecessary wall of text\n    [*]Quite a few bugs are still present in the game, which prevented some quests from being finished, some forced me to restart my PC, some disabled keyboard input [i](only in Chapter 4 weirdly)[/i], some shut the game down directly \n    [*]The whole EULA debacle with Owlcat still deserves to be mentioned, even if it's not a problem with the game itself\n[/list]\n\n[h2]The strange:[/h2]\n[list]\n    [*]The addition of the crusade system - not exactly sure why this game needed a Might and Magic minigame\n    [*]The camera mechanic in Chapter 4 [i](personally I also don't understand why that chapter had to be so long, but oh well)[/i]\n    [*]Tutorials did not feel very helpful at all. If you have no experience with these types of games, you may have a hard time getting into it\n    [*]You can, within one conversation, expect some lines to be voiced and some randomly not. I first thought that it was a bug, but no, most text in the game is actually not voiced\n    [*]After you bring up your map, if you try to zoom in on the map, it will not zoom in on the map, but rather adjust the size of the indicator which shows what part of the map is visible to you.

So you think you can breeze through the game on normal difficulty like you would with Assassin's Creed? No way. You will be in for a bad surprise. \n\nThe game has the same balancing and difficulty spike problem that Kingmaker already had. But this time, even worse. You will fight mob after mob that wrecks your party in no time. The game is a F5 / F8 simulator. If you forgot to buy the only spells that the devs intended you to use, you are f*cked up in some fortress far away from home. \n\nAlso, most enemies have crazy Magic resistance. So if your party has 3 casters, they are pretty useless and you won't do enough damage to survive the mobs (often 10 enemies at once). I would excpect that on Normal difficulty, you can use more or less any spells to damage the enemies. But this is not possible. The devs want you to use certain spells and if you didn't skill your character this way, you can start all over again. \n\nIt could have been a good game, but the difficulty spikes are so insane and so out of this world that I just can't enjoy it. The worst thing about the game is the Crusade Mode. Oh my good...every 2 minutes, overleveled Demon Armies will attack your base, ripping your best armies apart in seconds. And after loosing a couple of times, you will be auto-switched to Auto Crusade Mode. But actually you can be happy that you don't have to deal with this unbalanced mess anymore. \n\nHowever, graphics and music are good. But that doesn't help much if the balancing is totally off. Writing is also good. \n\nIn the end, you will be rewarded with a horrible ending. You have to fight the end boss once, then your party runs out of spells and then you have to fight 3 copies of the end boss. If you lose, you will win the game anyway.

It's the obligatory shell which ultimately forces me to turn away from an excellent story.\n\nThe first problem extends from the central conceit, even before the plot of a crusade against demons: a CRPG conversion of the Pathfinder roleplaying system. This comes with many hurdles, and this game clears them with finesse and clumsiness in equal measure. They have simplified the long list of 26 skills into a streamlined 11, not only because there were perhaps simply too many, and a number of them simply do not have application in a CRPG with necessarily finite interactions on a simulated two dimensional map. What's left is simple and efficient, Intelligence and Wisdom both get two \"knowledge\" skills to preserve the place that a high amount of skill ranks served, and all uses of all skills are intuitive.\n\nWhat has come with more struggle is the refusal to address the \"rocket tag\" dynamics of gameplay which manifest themselves shortly after level 5. There are people who love this type of gameplay and I am not saying in and of itself it is a bad design direction: the first edition of Pathfinder endured so long for reasons. The way the 'machine', the way the rules of the game are interpreted, adjudicates certain situations turns precise and remarkable combat situations into eye twitching slogs. Two examples, both relatively early in the game (Act 1 and Act 2) with minimum spoilers:\n\nYour party enters a room with 4 demons. They are at such a distance away from you that your melee fighters cannot strike them in the first turn, or maybe they won initiative. At any rate, each of them begins the combat by casting stinking cloud, a DC 13 Fortitude Save, placing all of the clouds directly on top of allies. The original description reads: \nAny creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. This is a poison effect.\nThey incorporated this rule element correctly. I argue that allowing the clouds to stack has only negative effects on gameplay, and must be categorized as an incorrect ruling. When each spell is cast, every party member in the area is forced to make a save. [i]And then,[/i] when their turn begins, they make a new save [i]against each cloud individually.[/i] This spell can completely disable characters for up to five rounds since they leave the cloud. This is very bad, to say the least. \n\nSecond situation, you are forced to enter a room with ghouls pouring in It does not matter how your party entered the room, if it is possible for the ghouls to aggro your main character [i]they are aggrod on your main character.[/i] That is annoying, but seems exploitable, if you can make a choke point with a couple of tanks. That is, until the game decides that seven ghouls mashing their face into two suits of armor doesn't make sense. The game [i]simply started allowing them to pass to attack my character[/i] when I tried this. I would simply stand up and leave if a human game master gave this situation to me. I don't need to be here, I don't need to put up with this.\n\nYour party moves intolerable slow over maps, and the best thing you can do to mitigate takes resources it shouldn't. In this game, all space must be recognized so all space is walked. Nothing is taken for granted, and this drags the pace of the game out.\n\nThe game maintains an inequity between classes, and creates new ones with it's attempts at streamlining. If you're not optimizing for damage you're not optimizing for anything. Take all feat taxes or watch spell after spell fizzle, and your damage remain in the low tens at best round after round. This also goes for all party members.\n\nSpeaking of the party of six, your character's \"protagonist\" role makes the game unforgiving in a way that the Pathfinder RPG was never meant to be: When your character dies in the original RPG there were a thousand solutions to that problem. Moreover, maybe it's not a problem to be solved at all per-se. Character death can be an opportunity to rethink your strategy, to make a new character who won't suffer the problems of the old. None of this is possible in Wrath of the Righteous. If your character dies, you reload a save and that's that. Experimenting with builds is a no go. All tactical decisions in and out of battle have to revolve around your character surviving. \n\nAnd on tedium, the Crusades system is simply that bad. It is a scaled down strategy game which takes too long to work through (mostly due to the forced animations) and it totally disconnected from your main story. There are difficulty options to attempt to curb this annoyance, but that can make the situation far worse: if you relinquish control over the Crusades, you will inevitably and automatically build things which will cause disapproval among your ranks. \n\nThis game has a modding scene, but there devs have a slightly obnoxious attitude towards it. They disable achievements while it detects that you have gameplay mods on, as if to 'tut tut' us for cheating. That in and of itself would be merely eye roll inducing except that most Quality of Life mods also triggers the achievement disable. That means you are at least heartily discouraged from fixing the game yourself, which isn't great for a game so obviously flawed.\n\nFinally, I must give a thought about the implementation of alignment. Wrath of the Righteous lives and dies on the alignment mechanic-- your character's morality and where it places them in the polarized cosmos. A story like this will likely become impossible to tell in a new way, since Paizo has now moved on from publishing for the Pathfinder RPG, in favor of Pathfinder 2nd Edition. Given that, the choices for approaching this story may fall between a ten year old set of books which require a group of competent players to run or this piece of software. It is a shame that I have to report that, even in terms of convenience, just buying the books and reading through them may provide an easier, if incomplete experience. \n\nI thought I'd complete the game before making this review, but two abandoned characters and a hundred hours on, my hand was forced, and it was forced to a negative review. A glitch of some kind broke the main quest's progression, and I cannot move on to Act 4 of the story. Realize that all of these severe problems I have mentioned to you crop up fairly early in the game. None of this is mentioning Act 4, which seems to get universal derision for having a needlessly difficult to navigate map and quest lines.\n\nThere is an overwhelming amount of good writing in this software, but time and time again the 'game' will present you with obnoxious hurdles before you can get from one piece to the next. So many unique and interesting companions don't get their time to shine because their niche overlaps with yours too much, or they're just not that useful. Getting locked into certain kinds of decisions gives replay value, yes, but that involves going through all of that again. And I can't for the life of me recommend a game which has proven so difficult in every way it shouldn't be. \n\nTL:DR Great story which is all gas no breaks all the way through... but a glitchy, frustrating and inadequate shell of mechanics and systems entrap it and keep it from soaring to the heights it needs to.", "timestamp_created": 1692157477, "timestamp_updated": 1692157477, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498257845640182495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144303874": {"recommendationid": "144303874", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962731543", "num_games_owned": 1732, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 19333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1223, "playtime_at_review": 12069, "last_played": 1700732966}, "language": "english", "review": "So many choices.

Having finally (after many many many retries) gotten past the interminable and crazily bad Act 4 -- a visual nightmare (not because of gore but because none of it made sense) which was a poor man's attempt to replicate Planescape: Torment -- you are putting back together the pieces of the ruined crusade mode left by an incompetent 100+ year old Queen who is now missing and probably in need of rescue and BAM!!

The Azata dragon is cool af. Crusade mode combat has good bones, just needs a lot better UI/UX and maybe some more tactical elements to flesh it out. And a good tutorial for those not well acquainted with chess or HoMM series combat. (Hint: Ranged weapons rule and healing stacks means you don't lose to attrition if you are careful.)

You're still not going to miss it though, you simply won't want to gouge your eyes out. The people complaining about are mostly from earlier builds.\n\n- It's long. most definitely 100+ hours for the first play through and very likely way more than that.\n\n- Story is not it's strong point. It's serviceable for sure, but don't expect a master piece.\nA lot of that comes from really flat characters, they are super shallow and clich\u00e9. Expect no subtlety here.\nThere is almost literally a line in the game were you say \"Weh! I will kill you now because I am a villain\". That's the kind of character depths you get. And the villain is especially guilty of that. \n\n- it's strong point on the other hand is combat and build variety. \nThere are for sure a bunch of dead skills and even entire classes, but there are soooo many that it hardly matters.\n\n- It's very unforgiving for new players, even if the game is actually really easy....if you know what to expect. BY the end of the game especially you become completely  OP almost regardless of your choices, but the beginning is really really rough.\n\n- Even this late..it still has bugs..and some are quest breaking, if not game breaking. Apparently some have been in kingmaker already and have not been fixed...\nIt has a lot of them, but most are harmless...some aren't. The logs don't tell you everything either or show wrong information at times. It's not enough to give it a negative rating but it is still a problem.\n\n- No nearly as much replay value as you would think from mythic paths. There can be some major changes, but they usually happen so late you no longer care. On the other hand it is balanced by the fact that is counts as more build variety.... But also a lot of the stuff here comes WWAAAYYYY too late. like 20 mintues away from beating the game kind of late.\n\nOverall, it is in the upper echelons of CRPGS. The pacing is very good, I kept thinking..\"just one more thing\".\nIt's fun, but get it for the combat, not the story.

Well, sort of, as short as a review of a 100+ hour game can be.\n\nThere is true greatness in this game, but the level of commitment and sometimes the strange choices for systems \u2013 makes much of the games best parts too far and few between.\n\nThe story is very cool and it can take many forms.\nThe companions are more complex than most other RPGs. They really feel like people with their own will and identities. They will, undoubtedly, surprise you. The companions are some of the best parts of the game, that and mainline quests.\n\nThe crusade management is fine, to a point, but the map and some of the systems and clutter makes the game a chore in many ways. Traveling the world map or issuing commands to your armies is a gigantic pain in the ass. It just takes too long and the UI is not optimal for this level of engagement. This is the biggest problem of the game because it makes it so hard to push through and not burn out. By the end of act four I was burned out. I spent the rest of the game speeding through the rest, it was the only way to finish the fight. Is still did 70 % of all quests if not more.\n\nCombat is very complicated and sometime downright unfair, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s not your average RPG. It\u2019s based on the Pathfinder tabletop? It makes no claim to be a simple game, and therefor is hard to fault for that.\nIf combat was closer to Pillars of Eternity I would like it more. As is, it becomes a bit too complicated and more or less a debuff gauntlet handling the massive amount of negative status effects the AI will pour over you.\nHowever, the difficulty options are excellent and you have a very high degree of control over many aspects of the games difficulty.

It's like a mix of Divinity Original Sin I/II and Baldur's Gate.\n\nArt: very good character art, interesting scenery\nStory:  very good, frequent updates, quest menu, maps\nVoice Acting: plenty and good\nMusic: meh, mostly dour mood symphony but changes often (like DOS2)\nGameplay: adjustable between DOS and BG, but see below\n\nReaction:  First dungeon takes way too long to get out of but was Fun.  The paddle controls are at first complicated but ok after (mouse/key is faster)  Too many options (overwhelming but actually optional, good).  Get past that and it's every bit as good as BGII or DOS1.5 yet not exactly same as either.  Pathfinder has neither the great symphony of BGI nor improved 3D prowess of DOS2; it's not a perfect 10 but may be a Must Have, idk after only getting out of first dungeon.\n\nI had fears (from bad reviews) early on they'd have messed up major elements like flow of battle or linearity.  I feel all the bad reviews are totally incorrect or even spam.  Game was not advertised as better than BG/DOS and it meets it's mark very well.\n\nMY #1 TIP:  use lower screen resolution REALLY - the Unity game engine is slugging and this will add many wasted hours over time.  The game is allot more fun if the interface is highly responsive (even the item window is slow if the 3D action is slow).  Unlike BG, PF has allot of small (interface issues) multiplied by allot of options that waste time: you'll need the speed to make the game nice to play.\n\nLet me compare to DOS.  Pathfinder's interface isn't as quick to use but similar.  (DOS1 had better gameplay, DOS2 better graphics).  The strategy of battle however is more like BG (and PF does it very well!)\n\nLet me compare to Baldur's Gate.  BG has excellent Canadian real symphony (not computer midi generated junk).  BG had great color choices for mood and setting.  Together with storytelling: BG had excellent atmosphere.  BG ran \"very responsively and smoothly\".  BG was very non-linear - BUT BORING and frustrating at times it was not perfect.  FOR PF - the story is great/better, music less good ... but there's only one \"Town/City\" and it's all damaged not really a city.  No multiple towns to visit per say.  However!  While all of PF is mostly\"broken damaged places\" they are not un-pretty - there is a flare in most areas that is eye catching - a flair that microsoft \"dark graphic\" rpg don't have - more like DOS1.5 i say.\n\nI'm still on first chapter.  Very good game.  For anyone who loves Baldur's Gate or Divinity Original Sin I will say if you can get this game on discount it's a MUST HAVE.  (discount because it's unity engine and has small but many interface inconveniences that add gamplay time - but which you learn to lessen and get around by playing)\n", "timestamp_created": 1691522062, "timestamp_updated": 1692608984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483091771602630615", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143662906": {"recommendationid": "143662906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099061984", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5586, "last_played": 1694984426}, "language": "english", "review": "Phenomenal game, story, and gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1691512035, "timestamp_updated": 1691512035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506912410259246826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143655238": {"recommendationid": "143655238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122420733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 20558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5105, "last_played": 1697992449}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Y los conjuros adicionales por una caracter\u00edstica alta ...!!??\nA\u00fan as\u00ed me flipa, de lo mejor que he jugado en este g\u00e9nero junto a Divinity 2.\n", "timestamp_created": 1691503963, "timestamp_updated": 1691503963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5579567551612854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143647837": {"recommendationid": "143647837", "author": {"steamid": "76561199524232059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 636, "last_played": 1697711141}, "language": "english", "review": "PF for PC.

That said it makes combat very satisfying once you get the grip on how the game works behind the scenes and in addition to that you can swap between RTwP and Turn-Based at your convenience. There are of course (very) few parts of the game that suffer from bad balancing but all in all it shouldn't deter you from enjoying the game since they can be overcome if you're creative. \n\nAs far as the crusader (mode) management  goes, I've noticed that it receives much unnecessary hate and nonsensical criticism. It's basically a mini and slightly worse Heroes III game inside the game, it provokes you to think about your next moves and fights that you may want to take or avoid. Without spoiling anything, let's just say that you need to pick a mage General in order to have the best time.

Un dia se dio cuenta que el era un gran aventurero capaz de entrar a una cruzada y destrozarle el agujero oscuro a cualquiera.\n\nJuanchito era tan bueno, que los villanos se arrodillaban a comerle el pancho afuera de las iglesias. El no te pegaba, pero te heria de otras formas, tenia un rayo adolficador a 30 metros que era tirado por la boca. Tambien era un gran chef que cocinaba pastafrolas, unas pastafrolas con esvasticas de masa arriba, estaban muy ricas. Dependia de quien lo comiera y la posicion de la luna y el sol. Si estaba entre 60 y 70 grados, te convertias en un mono que activaba modo nashe repartiendo corchos a todos lados. Lo mas fuerte que tenia era su palo de carne iracundo con la capacidad de desterrar tu chinchulin inflamado a lo mas recondito de un telo. Ni siquiera tenia que tocarte para hacerte mojar el pantalon, era el papichulo que todo lo conquista y todo lo vence con su mirada de galan. Una mirada tan poderosa que te provocaba abandonar el servidor en la tierra y mudarte a pluton.\n\nY no solo era un gran experto en toda arte desarrollada por el universo, tambien era un gran agricultor. Te enterraba la batata de una sola pi\u00f1a. Era tan fuerte la pi\u00f1a, que anulaba la vida en un rango de 10 metros, toda maceta de la abuela era consumida en segundos. Como si de la mano del dios Ra se tratara. Te purificaba de un pu\u00f1etazo.\n\nSe cuenta que una vez su pueblo fue atacado por una langosta gigante. Este buen samaritino, hijo de manuel belgrano y san martin. Criado por rosas. Nacido en plena epoca de revolucion de mayo. Agarro a la langosta, y le introdujo 1 gramo de trigo en el tractor rectal. Y todos preguntan siempre, si eso lo mato. No mi rey. No lo mato el gramo de trigo. Lo mato el pedazo de carne destructor de mundo que tenia entre las piernas. Le metio semejante caderazo, que lo convirtio en un jipi que arrojaba flores a los otros demonios, contagiando su buena onda y amor.\n\nLas leyendas continuaban apareciendo, como el dia que una chica lo conocio a el, fue tan fuerte la forma de conocerlo, que la convirtio en electrones para alimentar la bateria de su telefono. Muchos dicen que cuando tiene relaciones carnales, las mujeres no tienen relaciones con el, la misma fantasia creada en la mente de sus compa\u00f1eras temporales es suficiente para dejarlas desmayadas hasta que a juanchito se le ocurra volver a mirarlas con pensamientos impuros.\n\nMuchos dicen que el dia que nacio, se invento el primer feriado nacional. El no tuvo el privilegio de nacer, el nacimiento tuvo el privilegio de tenerlo. Todavia se dice que cuando quiere dormir vuelve al vientre de su madre para no tener frio y que tiene un televisor 8k con un calefactor adentro. A veces se toma vacaciones y usa vientres agenos para que el calor no sienta frio. Ademas de todas estos relatos, el lugar de nacimiento sigue siendo un misterio. Pero la mejor version que se ha contado es que el mismo construyo el hospital donde nacio. Y el que el planeta se desarrollo de acuerdo esperando su nacimiento.\n\nEl personaje juanchito es tan capaz de persuadir, que la otra persona es obligada a recortar todo su dialogo y decir. \"si juanchito\". para no malgastar su tiempo.\n\nUna de las pocas veces que utilizo un arma en la campa\u00f1a, fue para que cambie el eje de rotacion del sol, asi tenia 2 meses mas de verano.\n\nEl no utiliza la magia, la magia lo utiliza a el. Si hubiera sido mago, la tabla periodica estaria unificada en un solo elemento. Y como todo mago nato, en un experimento, hubiera dividido un planeta por accidente creando una bomba nuclear. Pero como es un guerrero, macho, monada, que acaricia otros universos con su mirada. No se enfrenta a los demonios invasores, resuelve todo levantandose de la cama. Abriendo la ventana y observa como reanudo la paz mundial, apreciando a los demonios besandose con las felices formas de vida que rien y bailan.\n\nCon el simple hecho de apoyar un pie en el aire, el clima cambia para favorecer a que las formas de vida reanuden una nueva vida en paz y prosperidad.", "timestamp_created": 1691453897, "timestamp_updated": 1691453999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143614841": {"recommendationid": "143614841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891209273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1695559352}, "language": "english", "review": "This PC game is considered one of the greatest CRPGs of all time.

Five, to be exact. Over and over I tried and failed to get through the start of the game, Act 1-- getting a few hours in before ultimately restarting with a new character or losing interest completely. This time, I finally stuck with it, and boy am I glad.\n\nVisually speaking, the game has some gorgeous visuals. The impressive and inspired locations definitely crop up more frequently as you get to the later acts, travelling to places which defy the natural laws of reality, pocket dimensions, things of that ilk... but even the normal areas associated with the earlier \"Acts\" of the game you explore can be gorgeous. The weather effects, particularly the more rare ones, are very nice to look at. The look of the gear you put on your characters can be very goofy, with jarring combinations of helmets, shields or even horrid looking eyeglasses, but the existence of a transmog system as well as a toggle to remove individual pieces of gear makes it a non-issue, or potentially even a boon if you like goofy things. \n\nBeyond that, I'd say the game does a very nice job of making melee combat feel -chunky-, with blows bisecting, beheading or sending enemies flying across the room as you get to the higher levels. Magic looks great when you cast it, too-- lightning arcing across the room, beams of holy light coming down from the heavens, though I rarely found it reflect on the bodies of my enemies like physical attacks did. Never did I see disintegrate actually, well, disintegrate someone.\n\nExploration is nice. There's a -lot- of places you can go, and barring a rare few portions of the game, you generally have as much time as you'd like to explore those places at your leisure, making the game a fairly relaxed, enjoyable experience compared to Kingmaker, where most quests had visible or not so visible timers. There's a fair few hidden areas and a couple of hidden quests and a frankly silly amount of hidden loot to reward exploration, and I always felt pleasantly surprised hearing the 'ping' notification of finding something hidden.\n\nPathfinding, ironically, is quite poor. Your AI companions will blunder into traps that they know are there, which can lead to frustration- but the game pauses every time you detect a trap or a new enemy, so the frustration can be alleviated somewhat. I thought the game was rather good about autosaving as well, generally giving you an autosave before or after entering a new location. I never lost significant progress.\n\nThe combat was rather enjoyable, despite my loathing for the Pathfinder 1e system. My frustrations with it, the abundance of math, the numerous stacking buffs interlocking and contradicting each other and the strange ways actions are divided was mostly settled by the medium, WotR's videogame nature speeding up the tedium significantly. I -love- that you can swap freely between turn based and real time with pause. The latter serves as an excellent way of churning through \"trash\" encounters, where you're fighting plenty of weak enemies that aren't much of a threat, while the former makes really tricky boss fights and the like much more manageable and fair. Being able to speed up the enemy's turn in turn based mode was also very welcome, and I came to miss it when playing other games.\n\nThe main thing which made me love WotR, however, was the writing. From the quests to my companions (one of the biggest highlights of the game imo), I never felt bored or like my choices weren't mattering. All the way into Act 5, choices I'd made long before then came back to influence my playthrough, and toward the end I felt as though I'd truly worked hard for the conclusion I got to the game. Voice acting wise, the game is mostly top notch. All of it has some pretty excellent delivery, and while a majority of the dialogue is silent, the main quest as well as important side quests remain voiced, and deliver some excellent performances in those moments.\n\nOf all the thirteen companions in the game, there were only two I disliked-- and even then, I could see their merits. I find it tricky to write about what I liked without spoiling things by going into too much detail, but suffice to say, I felt like the crew you collect form a genuine bond through campfire dialogues between your companions, and that all of them have a lot of humanity to them, feeling very... earnest? For lack of a better word. A fair few of them are evil, or neutral, but despite that they all felt -useful- and like they had valid points and interesting philosophies or reasons for thinking the way they do. It felt like my actions were influencing them, for better or worse, that for all the good I did on their behalf, it would have been just as easy to corrupt them or exploit their problems for my own ends.\n\nThe main protagonist is mostly silent, though the 'voice packs' you can choose for your 'command quips' (just stuff you say when moving to a place, attacking something, sneaking, casting a spell and so on) all have a -ton- of character and personally made roleplaying a lot more fun. The portrait art you can choose for your characters is also quite lovely.\n\nIt can be difficult figuring out what character you want to play. The game doesn't hold your hand, and the abundance of classes, and the multiple subclasses associated with each, make choosing really hard. It doesn't help that many of the choices are bad ones that can cripple you in the long run. I'd personally recommend playing a Paladin, as it's a fairly simple but thoroughly effective class which remains useful the entire game long, with the Paladin being a natural counter to the demons which form the game's main enemies.\n\nI probably missed some positives. UI and inventory management is very sleek and good. You can sort things and sell trash easily, and your inventory is categorized nicely. The game does have its faults, though.\n\nTo begin with, as you progress through the game 'buffing' by stacking beneficial spells on your party becomes more and more essential the higher a difficulty you're on. While not initially a problem, you will come to a point where you've got 100~ spells running at a time. That... really *sucks* when you're having to manually apply them all, one after the other. It caused me a great deal of frustration and ate up a lot of time before I installed a mod called 'Bubble Buff Bot', which introduced a 'one button buff' that I could very easily manage and adjust. Install that mod, at the very least, though be aware that it might disable achievements for you. (There's ways of working around that)\n\nOther issues... well, I'd start by saying that the game has a really awful minigame where you manage armies, kinda like Heroes of Might and Magic? You create buildings in settlements, recruit armies, and send those armies to attack the enemy, whereupon you're taken to a grid-based, turn-based battlesystem very much like HoMaM. Unfortunately, unlike HoMaM, it sucks. Really bad. It was a genuine drain of my enjoyment of the game until I started cheating that aspect away, essentially removing it. It's not entirely without merit-- the armies you collect and the way your crusade progresses reflects your choices really well. A \"demonic\" commander could raise a demon army and do 'demonic' things while an angelic commander could do the opposite, inspiring their troops and seeking the most good and virtuous ways out of complex political dilemmas.\n\nProgressing through the crusade mode, you're constantly faced with 'event cards' where you're given a block of text describing some dilemma you've been asked to weigh in on, and multiple choices with drawbacks and benefits, and that part is genuinely engaging and fun, making for good roleplay. Unfortunately the system it feeds into is the battle part of the Crusade minigame. \n\nTraveling through maps can be really tedious with the party's slow movespeed. Especially in Act 4. Still a good game. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1691383223, "timestamp_updated": 1691383223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836450278759002686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143561470": {"recommendationid": "143561470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025218776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 26967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2484, "playtime_at_review": 10932, "last_played": 1700691058}, "language": "english", "review": "Unforgiving like the first pathfinder game and often unfair, but otherwise a solid game with a great story.

It's a test you don't get to study for, and I've never much liked those.\nThe combat is a slog even on core (one of the harder difficulty settings, but not by any means the hardest, and the lowest you can get a lot of achievements on).

After setting such absolute stakes, it goes on to gently push the player to kill the head inquisitor for hunting witches. If you don't (it is optional, of course) the dialogue from a rival cleric group's npc simply assumes you've killed him regardless, making it clear the devs and narrative expect you to so strongly that they take it for granted. Before this we were introduced to the outright inept city spymaster, who admitted to hearing rumors of a demon cult right below the city's main fort (which houses the earlier crystal) and simply never bothered to investigate. It's frustrating that the lazybones is presented as a buddy and an ally when there's some standing two feet away with the vigor and willingness to really get things done, who I'm expected to kill for it. He may be zealot, but in a war against literal demons I should hope he is.\n\nI understand the story puts a point on \"keeping our humanity, because if we became monsters they may as well have won\", but having one city go full \"1984\" seems like a microscopically small price to pay for the fate of the entire world.", "timestamp_created": 1691145483, "timestamp_updated": 1691145483, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585307002067565918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143379855": {"recommendationid": "143379855", "author": {"steamid": "76561199207255419", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2747, "last_played": 1691148779}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't finish the game yet but steam asks to write something.

But I\u2019d rather play Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. Hear me out.\n\n1. It\u2019s more fun building characters in Pathfinder. I\u2019ve played a lot of 5E, and I like many things about it, but 5E is oversimplified. You don\u2019t get many choices beyond race, class, and subclass. Pathfinder has more subclasses and feats, and you get many more feats to customize your character with. Add to this the mythic paths, and there are just a lot more options for creating interesting character builds. Some people might want it simple. But if you like strategically optimizing characters, there\u2019s a lot more of that in Pathfinder.\n2. There are better pets and actual mounts in Pathfinder: WotR. Your pets level up and get classes. You can ride your animal companions (and it is actually a huge advantage in combat to do so). Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 doesn\u2019t seem to have mounts.\n3. There are a lot more spells in Pathfinder: WotR. WotR has a higher level cap (20 compared to Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2019s 12) so you can get to higher levels with more powerful spells.\n4. Multiclassing is more interesting in Pathfinder. Now it is true that there are a lot of multiclassing options in Pathfinder that aren\u2019t a good idea. But if you know what you are doing you can create some very effective and interesting builds by multiclassing. In 5E, it is generally not optimal to multiclass.\n5. I only really played what was available in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2019s early access so far, but from that experience, I feel like the story and characters are more engaging in Pathfinder WotR. Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 writing does seem good though, and I like its tie-ins with tabletop adventures like Descent Into Avernus, but to me, it seemed like Pathfinder: WotR is more story driven.\n6. I like that Pathfinder WotR has both turn-based and real-time combat. I like turn-based combat a lot\u2026 when it makes sense. When it\u2019s just dungeon encounter #8 of 40, and the stakes aren\u2019t very high, I don\u2019t want to micromanage it. It\u2019s nice to roll through lighter encounters in 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes.\n7. I can read faster than voice actors can talk. Pathfinder WotR frequently gives you a lot of exposition in text blocks without fancy voice acting. And that\u2019s fine with me. Most of the time, I was going to finish reading the text before the voice acting was done and cut it short anyway.\n8. Pathfinder WotR is a very in-depth classical isometric crpg. It\u2019s got what I like. A world map, where I can choose where to explore in what order, quests, dungeon crawling, character development, etc. \n9.  I like the strategy game features in WotR, I was a big fan of HOMM 3 and I like city management games. Pathfinder WotR feels very much like a continuation of the old-school crpg tradition with some nice strategy/management game features added.\n10. Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is a crpg too, but it leans really heavily on interacting with the environment. That\u2019s kind of its big appeal, doing creative, maybe absurd, things in the environment. You can throw a gnome at a goblin, knocking the goblin off a cliff or into a puddle of oil which you then set on fire. There\u2019s certainly something to like about that kind of game play, but it wasn\u2019t really present in any crpgs before BG 3\u2019s predecessor, the Divinity games. Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 also has great graphics. But despite these neat features, Pathfinder WotR is the deeper crpg in a lot of ways. I guess it depends on what you are in the mood for, old school crpg quests and dungeon crawling, detailed character building, and city and army management, or creative choices in a very interactive environment.\n11. First-time players of Pathfinder WotR may find it surprisingly difficult. But its encounters, at least the serious ones, aren\u2019t really calibrated for you to just trade blows with the demons. You are expected to use a lot of spells and items, especially to buff up before the fight, and sometimes to counter the particular dangers of a special foe. If you don\u2019t want to buff up before fights or figure out what counters dangerous enemies, you can also just turn the difficulty down on the fly. Personally, I don\u2019t go in unhasted.\n12. A lot of the character customization in Baldur's Gate 3 is adjusting hairstyles and other aesthetics. And BG 3 does have very nice graphics and if you don't spend at least 30 hours playing with all of the hair color and makeup options, you haven't really gotten your money's worth. But I actually really like that you can import portraits in Pathfinder WotR. Midjourney can make really cool-looking fantasy portraits, so even with all the tools in BG 3, I still like the look of my Pathfinder WotR character better. \n13.

Also, cannot understand why the enemy AI has no regard for any opponents anywhere near it, just sends them straight past them all towards my PC main.  Just ridiculous game mechanics spoiling the game.  Also the way this game is balanced in terms of how the enemies are in combat just pushes this min/max play style which is just not what a lot of people want in an RPG.

BG3 has much more fun fights, still very much challenging, some very tough, but even when you fail and die you still feel like you had fun.   As soon as I hit this fight, I thought here we go again.  I cannot honestly explain why I spent a couple hundred hours in Kingmaker, I cannot say I immensely enjoyed it, story mode was a total waste of time as it was far too easy, normal difficulty in both games is a total grind that worsens as you progress.

You get to do good or evil or even fun stuff and it's the strongest element of the game by far. Characters range from great to just OK, no-one got kicked out of my party because I didn't want to deal with them. The overall story is good enough however it struggles from the length of the game, you'll have figured out any intrigue long before the game finally gets there.\nThe gameplay is serviceable till it decides you need to be challenged at which point it devolves into tedium. The pathfinder rule set is, lets say not very friendly. The stat bloat is crazy so min maxing becomes more and more important. Prebuffing is the name of the game and its a long list of buffs. The balance can get wacky and auto level up is not up to the task of the harder fights. Your level up choices are more important than any strategy and its a lot of work.\nThere is also the crusade management aspect of the game, its mostly filler. You'll get checked pretty hard on occasion but that's just something to save scum and come back to with bigger numbers. It might be needed filler as it gives you a change from the stress of a weirdly balanced fight with some easier content.\n\n\nIn conclusion: If you love pathfinder rules, D&D 2.5e etc you could enjoy this. If you like RPGs for the story or class fantasy over the mechanics I'd recommend going elsewhere as this one is a struggle. A shame because the writing is pretty good, maybe slog through it on sale, its what I did. I wish I'd moved on like it seems many others did.

WotR is definitely one of my favourite cRPGs I've played over the past 30 years. The central story and supporting NPC party cast are interesting and there's enough well-written lore spread throughout the game that no area felt stale. The mythic paths add some nice replayability to the game as they all play very differently and have direct changes to core storylines.\n\nI strongly recommend new players start at lower difficulties, because the game is punishing even on Core if you're going in blind. Don't even attempt Unfair unless you have substantial knowledge of the game and mechanics, and are really good at building strong characters (the game warns you of this, and it doesn't lie). Beating Unfair was one of the high points of my gaming career!\n\nThere are a couple areas that I have some negative feelings about, though. The first is the amount of time it takes to cast party buffs. On higher difficulties (and mandatory on Unfair), you basically need every single buff available to you active, on just about every single fight, right from the start until the final fight. Much of my time on Unfair was spent casting buffs. There needs to be a way to make this process faster, like automatic casts upon finishing rest, or making all buffs instant-cast while out of combat or a specified time after finishing rest.\n\nThe other thing I dislike is how jarring some of the alignment dialogue options are. Good and evil are about what you'd expect, but the law-chaos axis often feels forced. Playing a paladin is especially strange because \"lawful\" basically means \"merciless\" in WotR, which doesn't fit the archetypal Lawful Good character. Many of the options feel like \"lawful evil\", not \"lawful.\" Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a huge problem (always choose \"good\"), but in this game, any alignment choice moves you towards your chosen alignment AND neutral. \"Good\" choice moves you to NG. \"Chaotic\" towards CN, etc. You must sometimes choose a Lawful action even if they are very out of character in order to remain a paladin. You *can fall* by being too good, which is utterly silly. It would be nice to have \"lawful good\" dialogue actions, where you're not sacrificing one or the other. \n\nDespite those problems, I still love the game. It is well worth picking the game up even for one playthrough. You'll get your money's worth as the game is long, challenging, and interesting.

Improvements in AI, in the UI, small quality-of-life improvements, fixes to many of the bugs, and a major change to the management system all made for a far, far more appealing and fun game.\n\nThe Crusade management mode of the game is enormously better than Kingmaker's kingdom management. Gone are the ridiculous time constraints that made Kingmaker's management not-fun. No longer do I feel like I'm racing against the clock just to eke out successes through save-scumming. While the crusade management is simpler, it isn't to the detriment of the game. It works better in every aspect.\n\nThe quests in the game are more fun, too. It feels as if there were fewer than in Kingmaker, but that might be a result of me just enjoying them so much more. I was disappointed as I began to run out of quests at the end of each chapter. They're also written better, which leads me to the next point: the story.\n\nThe story is excellent. It's cohesive in a way I didn't expect. Themes are adhered to and elevated through related (and sometimes unrelated) questlines. You feel like you have real choices along the way, and I never felt shoehorned into a particular playstyle or alignment or storyline.\n\nMy only, very minor, gripe is that there are some bugs in the game that can leave you frustrated. Things like spellbooks not updating properly after a retrain, or abilities disappearing. Minor issues that don't make the game unplayable, but are still irritating when you discover them.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Wrath of the Righteous.", "timestamp_created": 1690953446, "timestamp_updated": 1690953446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479233235120773315", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143237399": {"recommendationid": "143237399", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199235046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11541, "last_played": 1691032734}, "language": "english", "review": "Its ok i guess", "timestamp_created": 1690942976, "timestamp_updated": 1690942976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483091771602630615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143231852": {"recommendationid": "143231852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037468355", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 25622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15557, "last_played": 1695944637}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has me conflicted.\n\nOn one hand, it is very \"woke\" for its time.\nAll women are powerful, strong, driven and amazing.\nAll men are soft, \"victims\", bloodthirsty, or stupidly incompetent.\nAll major NPC's are women, bar none. \nAlso, after playing it thought a few times I feel the writing leans to playing more \"you can be anything you want\" chaotic.\n\nOn the other hand, \nThe mechanics are fun, \nthe settings are awesome, and \nthe overall story is really cool.\n\nFor its faults, it is still one of the best CRPG's out there, imo.\n\nShould you buy it?\nWell, if you are a fan of heavy handed fem- supremism, overt and in-your-face homosexuality, and a generally very liberal game.. you should be good.\nIf you cant handle that.. its still a good game.. just use your imagination to get you through some points.\n\nTL;DR\nWoke, but bearable.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690933452, "timestamp_updated": 1690933452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462417244911193848", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143231586": {"recommendationid": "143231586", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970349591", "num_games_owned": 1242, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1182, "last_played": 1691014481}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is rich and enjoyable, reading books, text, character dialog and anything i come across makes me care about characters and the world, just like a well delivered pen and paper game.\n\nFirst time playing this system and I enjoy it so much I will try it out on the tabletop as well.", "timestamp_created": 1690932992, "timestamp_updated": 1690932992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143229245": {"recommendationid": "143229245", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983111961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7101, "last_played": 1694435722}, "language": "english", "review": "It has Wenduag and you can romance her.

Good lord how I tried. TL;DR: Game's balance on core difficulty is busted. If you want a \"close to tabletop\" experience, you're not going to get that here unless you're okay making things more or less trivial in an attempt to do so.\n\n[i]Preface: I played on Core difficulty for ~45 hours, eventually enabling \"slightly weaker enemies\" in a vain attempt to continue play before then using a set of community suggested difficulty settings to \"bring it down to tabletop difficulty\" but doing so completely trivializes the game. I've been playing 3.x / Pathfinder since 3.0 was released, for what that's worth, I would consider my system knowledge to be above average.[/i]\n\nI played through Kingmaker in its entirety and had a good time with it up until the House at the End of Time where it really felt like Owlcat took the wheel with regards to game balance and completely upended the idea of a proper difficulty progression and what \"reasonable\" difficulty should be on a difficulty setting which should (as closely as is reasonable) mimic tabletop play.\n\nWrath of the Righteous is like that, but more or less from the start. At basically no point in my playthrough did my party feel like they were doing anything more than barely clawing their way through encounters. At almost no point did my characters feel \"mythic\" in power. When you're routinely facing enemies with *at least* twice as many levels as your average party level, there's something wrong. An encounter for a 9th level party shouldn't consist of a 19th level NPC, an 18 HD dragon, and four other 10 HD critters. The absolutely bloated hit dice/levels on creatures makes basically anything involving spell resistance or saving throws useless from the party's side of things.

Las mec\u00e1nicas del ej\u00e9rcito y gobierno son una mejora con respecto al anterior, pero siguen acabando siendo limitadas y aburridas y, por c\u00f3mo funciona el reclutamiento, al final acabas usando solo un pu\u00f1ado de unidades de todas las disponibles.

The game is not really getting better despite the updates it receives.\n\nThe cycle looks something like this: we get an absolutely bug-infested content release, like the initial release or a DLC, then come the patches which break as many things as they fix, then a new pack of buggy content. As a result, you can never really play the game, there's always some problem, some crash, some bug etc.\n\nNow, let me note that I realize that the ending is (usually) techincally reachable, and even if something does not allow the player to progress, it is (often) techincally possible to fiddle with the game state through a mod and maybe fix your problem.\n\nI write \"can never really play the game\" because it's a number-crunchy combat-heavy cRPG where the numbers that form the basis of combat do not ever completely make sense due to endless bugs and thoughtless implementations, and that leads to my enjoyment of combat being spoiled.\n\nFor me, the core gameplay of Pathfinder: WOTR is the combat.

The spiritual successor to D&D 3.5 and possibly one of the best RPG systems out there.  It had a previous CRPG in Pathfinder: Kingmaker, but this one blows that game away.\n\nThis game allows you to get a really great feel, as if you are playing a game that is being run by a sadistic and well prepared DM.  It takes you through all the paces of your character's development, from the opening levels where you can barely destroy a group of Goblins, all the way to killing monsters that are godlike in their power.  The Pathfinder system lends itself well to a CRPG, and it shows in the way that the game plays for multiple hours.  The system allows for you to fairly easily calculate what you can and can not handle combat wise and it shows you why a roll succeeded or failed.  There is never any doubt as to why things are being calculated the way that they are.  Parts of it may seem... unfair... but that is because as the Knight-Commander, you have more power at your disposal than most PCs will ever have, even having reached level 20 and beyond.  And in order to properly challenge you... the monsters have to have some crazy stuff going on.\n\nThe storyline is top notch.  Ripped from a very popular Adventure Path, Wrath of the Righteous has you take command of the Knight-Commander, the leader of the Crusade against the Worldwound, a gaping hole in the land of Golarion that hordes of demons from the Abyss are using to flood into the prime material plane.  For some reason, you have these strange 'Mythic Powers' that enhance both you and your allies, making you a demon killing machine.  You will find your way through different stages, as your individual power and the power of the crusade grows ever greater, pushing towards the final confrontation that will either save Golarion,.. or doom it forever as a waypoint for the Abyss.\n\nThe Mythic Paths are really interesting and there are multiple to choose from.  Most you unlock easily and naturally as you progress through the story, but some you have to actively work to unlock.  These Paths take your character and spin off their abilities in interesting ways, causing your character to evolve abilities that they would never be able to obtain in a standard game of Pathfinder.  This is one of the things that makes the game so much fun, even if you know Pathfinder already back and front.  The ways that the paths can interact with your character classes are many and varied and you can easily spend hours just trying to figure out how your character should progress and which path they should take.  Ultimately, the decision is up to you!\n\nNow, on to one of the things that can make this game hard to play.  I said above that you have so many different ways that you can make your character that is true to the extreme.  Basically, every character class, feat or ability that has been published for Pathfinder 1st edition is available, somehow, in this game.  It is VERY easy to make a mistake and make your character virtually unplayable.  You have to be careful about how you want to make your PC.  Now, there are several in game ways to help you with this.\n\n1.  The game offers some pretty good selections, particularly when it comes to feats.  The game will help you to choose which things that you can take, so that you can make a good and informed decision about where your character is headed.\n2.  The game tries to let you know if the character race you are going to choose is going to be hard to play, because there are some doozies in there.\n3.  The game allows you to do a full respec for your main character.  This resets all your character's skills, abilities, and everything to 0.  You get to keep your levels, but you can reallocate them as you choose to better fit your style.  This allows you to fix a mistake you think you may have had and it allows you to continue with your individual character's story rather than having to start completely from scratch.\n\nI really enjoyed this game.  I think it is the best CRPG to come out in YEARS and I was hooked immediately.  I can't recommend this game enough.\n\nIf you like D&D or Pathfinder, give this game a look!", "timestamp_created": 1690773222, "timestamp_updated": 1690773222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508862614631652832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143121165": {"recommendationid": "143121165", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994612766", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 11215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11025, "last_played": 1690946995}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest cRPGs I've ever played.

WoTR was an improvement on Kingmaker for me in almost all aspects. I'll give a generally run down of the main game before a few quick reviews of the DLCs on offer. I am writing this now because I appreciate the developers being open about a mistake made, although I must say most AAA developers are committing the same nonsense with little repercussions. \n\nWoTR Main Story: 9/10\nI really enjoyed the story of WoTR, have attempted many Mythic Paths and restarted multiple characters, multiple times. Some of my general pet peeves with \"Evil\" game paths were addressed in parts by the Mythic Path system. The story itself follows the PnP campaign of the same name, one of the more enjoyable in my opinion. I won't spoil any more than that but a few acts were stand-outs for me, ACT IV being my personal highlight. \n\nGraphics: 8/10\nOn release was a serviceable Isometric RPG with some stuttering issues and bugs, which were solved from the many patches implemented since. Today, the game runs smoothly on my middling system and I haven't had any bugs pop up for quite some time. The world itself is probably the standout over character models. \n\nGameplay: 10/10\nI would say this game has an extreme learning curve if you haven't had experience with the PnP system. But stick at it, it gets easier and more enjoyable with time. Character development gets more and more enjoyable, the more you understand how feats work and interact with one another and across to the other systems that affect your character like BAB, AC and Mythic Path choices. The depth can be insane if you want it to be, which works well for higher difficulties. Easier modes let you explore the world but there is potential for an extremely tactical approach. I am not a huge fan of Real Time with Pause and prefer Turn Based, but be aware that playing TB mode makes the game a fair amount longer to get through as battles generally eat up more time. \n\nDLCs: 6/10\nBit of a mixed bag really, I enjoyed most for what they are, but I feel like the DLCs in Kingmaker were more enjoyable for me personally. As someone who likes to try builds and test out party composition, the dungeon DLC, The Treasure of the Midnight Isles has been my most liked. The Last Sarkorians is cool but I haven't been able to place the character really in my general lineups. Through the Ashes and Inevitable Excess I haven't really played, I end up just going for a new run instead which may be a \"me problem\" really. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1690706242, "timestamp_updated": 1690706242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143069668": {"recommendationid": "143069668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188242986", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 62250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 558, "playtime_at_review": 60184, "last_played": 1700725767}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best cRPGs of all time.

On my play through the story has not yet been completed only act 2.\n\nAs far as CRPG's go this is for sure one of the best I have played coming from an individual who does not enjoy the genre that much this one is an exception. As far as I have played ( start of act 2 ) the story has been fantastic especially in regards to the crusade, the fight against the demons, the mythic paths, characters both supporting an main there really is nothing I can criticise I have always been a sucker for stories involving a black and white good vs evil and while stories like that can be pretty cut and dry and perhaps a bit bland WOTR really does a great job of showing why the crusaders fight. This is shown arguably or at the very least for me the best in how the demons treat humans without spoiling too much there is a scene where a succubus has tricked some crusaders into believing that the succubus is the very incarnation of a goddess and has one crusader cut his own eyes out for having sinful thoughts about the goddess's body. It really encapsulates why these demons are by every meaning of the word a blight to be purged and sure that crusader was sinful but that doesn't mean he has to carve his own eyes out and by walking the path of righteousness the game really makes you feel like a holy crusader ( if you go down that path )  as opposed to say just being the good guy like in a game like Mass Effect. The game really is a step up from Kingmaker in the sense that not only is the story good but the city / crusade management is much easier and can even be switched off if you feel so inclined I did not feel the need to do so though and have been having a great time raising my armies and building up my cities to vanquish the demons. And now to address the elephant in the room...Yes the game's developers did try to implement spyware into the game a spyware that in a nutshell tracks what you are doing online and reports back so your data can be sold the highest bidder and yes that is among the highest sins a developer could do but I will argue the point that within the same day of the spyware patch being pumped out the developers walked back their decision and completely removed it from the game as well as deleting any and all data that was collected if you can believe them. In my eyes this is acceptable sure it does not change what they tried to do but the fact that it was removed so quickly after the player backlash makes things a little better.

Yes, but it also has many frustrating aspects that spoils the fun.\n\nPros:\n\n- Awesome story.\n\n- The choices really matter.\n\n- Each mythical path significantly influences the story progression.\n\n- A massive number of possible combinations: numerous skills, items, builds, and more, giving the impression that this game is endless.\n\n- Well-developed character romances.\n\n- The devs recycled assets from Kingmaker, which I find a great idea if it speeds up the game's development and allows them to focus more on the main content.\n\n- Aivu is the best character in the game, by far, and her cuteness is irresistible.\n\nCons:\n\n- Extremely grindy. If you play without mods, expect frequent annoyances like having to disable numerous traps one after the other, even in places where it makes no sense for them to be. The traps are just pointless and time-consuming. Who would install so many traps everywhere?\n\n- Making a single wrong choice or not setting up camp at the exact moment can break your playthrough. For example, I was romancing Wenduag, and she suddenly attacked my party for no reason due to one of those missed steps. I couldn't romance Areshuale either for the same reasons. Why would the devs do this? It takes away the player's freedom to make choices and makes no sense in the story.\n\n- A game that requires a walkthrough to be played has failed to become a fun game.\n\n- Standalone stories, like Through the Ashes and Inevitable Excess are just a waste of development time that could be used improving the main game, creating a new mythical path, expanding Aivu's story and so on.\n\n- A lot of complexities in the game could be simply facilitated, like a mechanism to auto buff the party for example.\n\n- The devs used some sort of spyware to collect data from the players.

I cannot say that I do not recommend it.  I've had a ton of fun through the character generator and acts 1-3.

With all that being said with over 50+ unique save game files I've only made it through the 40-50% mark of the game once.  The game for me is simply too long, with too many combat encounters that very quickly become boring, repetitive and easy.  I normally play on Core which is a moderate difficulty but at a certain point I just turn off turn-based switch to real time with (no pause) and just click on the mini map to clear map after map to get to my next morsel of story.  The mix and the balance is off on combat/story.  Add to that some very poor/non-intuitive puzzles (fair enough only a few are non-optional).  The mythic system was meant to increase replay-ability and I'm sure it does (I've tried all the non-evil paths) but it's mostly window dressing on the same (rather poor) story.  At some point during the game I just want to slaughter all of my teammates (maybe not ember), villains and npcs, just to see a title card for the end game.  I've resigned myself to youtube videos of the ending without what eventually feels like all the boring work of grinding through the maps and puzzles in the back half of the game.

However, I strongly suggest reading the rest of the review as this has done little to change the damage to trust their actions have caused, and I have concerns for the companies values going forward. I still feel any post-purchase required changes are theft of personal property, and despise that they seem to use mobile industry \"standards\" as their basis for how they act. I am still unsure if I will buy further products from Owlcat, but know if they try similar things in future games/updates I never will. \n\nLet me start off with the fact that I absolutely love this gave. It is likely my favorite CRPG, fighting with DOS2, which is saying something because I love CRPGs. But I need to give a recommendation to avoid this game due to the recent change to EULA requiring acceptance to install invasive tracking software on the system before you can play. Despite the decision to reverse this, I have lost a great deal of faith in the company due to this for the following reasons.\n\n1. The software is invasive and shouldn't be in a video game like this in the first place. In the community posts, they defend their actions as \"it being industry standard, especially on mobile games\". This is very weak and shows a lack of understanding. Many horrendous behaviors are industry standard, but not justifiable. Real-money gambling is the industry standard right now in games. Battle passes are industry standard. Claiming smoking doesn't cause health effects used to be the industry standard. I expect better from companies than just industry standards, especially when they are comparing with the mobile game market. \n2. The EULA would be still unacceptable, but better if it was A) option or B) there from the beginning. But as it, it forces people who have owned the product for years to accept this change showing the devs don't believe anyone really owns the game. Essentially, they are stealing the product you bought and making you rebuy it with your data, and if you don't like it then you lose the product. \n\nUnfortunately, these are the kind of actions that require a lot of good faith actions and communication to repair the damage, and the community post does not own up to the severity of their actions as of now. I was eagerly waiting for Rogue Traders and pretty much a guaranteed launch buy (just waiting for reviews). Now I am not certain if I will be, and I certainly will not be if they put tracking software in the game which cannot be opted out from. \n\nDevelopers, from a loving fan of your game, please do better so I can enjoy (and buy!) them in the future. Own up to just how serious the forced changes were (theft essentially), that comparing with mobile game \"standard\" is not your team's standards, and continue making great games.", "timestamp_created": 1690511031, "timestamp_updated": 1690744489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616053462028503418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142928769": {"recommendationid": "142928769", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964235151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 968, "playtime_at_review": 3616, "last_played": 1700542843}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is amazing.

Maybe some of that is system bias, since I loved 3.5 and love Pathfinder even more. The characters (with one or two exceptions) are interesting and engaging, the story does a very good (arguably *too good*) job of making you feel like the Big Damn Heroes\u2122 , and the Crusade mode...well, while it's not my favorite thing in the game, unlike a lot of the other reviewers I actually enjoyed it; however, that may be because I've never actually played Heroes of Might and Magic, so the army combat was actually new(ish) to me. \n\nI'm not 100% sure if I'd say it was an improvement over Kingmaker. To me, at least, a lot of the companions were more fun than those in KM. On the other hand, However, one big difference is that the ones in WOTR feel a bit larger-than-life, which is fitting with the theme. In KM you get a gnome sorcerer working for the bad guys, a ranger seeking to avenge his family, a dwarf priest who embraces nihilism, a barbarian seeking to prove herself, et cetera. In WOTR, you get a champion of the descendants of underground crusaders, an atheist (misotheist maybe?) being unknowingly advised by an empyreal lord, the last scion of a noble house of Aasimar (they might not ALL be aasimar, but he was, his mom was, so...), a succubus seeking to redeem herself and shed her demonic nature, a priest whose search for his brother will take him to the Abyss and back, an assassin willing to try and take out a *BALOR* , a Tiefling rogue with a rather impressive lineage, and a high-ranking gnomish Hellknight. These characters feel a bit more mythical...which, given that one of your level-up mechanics in this game is *literally* your \"mythic path,\" seems perfectly appropriate. Now, not all of the characters in WOTR have this sort of feel to them, but it's a common enough hing among them to be noticeable. Personally, I enjoy it, but I also enjoy the somewhat more grounded companions in KM, and I can certainly understand people who prefer the more grounded companions.\n\nOwlcat games also have a history (is it a \"history\" when they've done 2 games and it's been in both, or do you need more games to have a \"history\" ...?) of being incredibly buggy at launch. I still remember in Kingmaker having a lumberjack tell me that I failed to save his fellows from a fey and that they'd died, when I'd managed to talk the fey out of killing them and they were both alive and well and like 10 feet from him, after all. They have, imo, done a much better job addressing the bugs with WOTR than they did in Kingmaker, and I believe they even had fewer bugs at launch (I could be wrong). \n\nNow, you might be wondering why the recent reviews are so low. This is something I always ask myself, when \"recent reviews\" score differs drastically from \"all reviews.\" Recently, the devs screwed up, hard. They included a tool for data harvesting in a new patch. Yes, this was a bad move. What I don't understand is people saying they \"snuck it in\" when...it was literally right in the patch notes, and right in the new EULA (the latter, admittedly, doesn't mean as much since a lot of people don't read EULAs, but at least Owlcat goes through the trouble of making their EULA short enough that you *can* read it if so *inclined*). *Within 24 hours* (I think maybe even 12) they had *removed the tool entirely* , and issued an apology. This is, frankly the kind of thing you *want to see* when a company screws up. \n\nUnfortunately, I'm still seeing a bunch of people who demanded (RIGHTLY, mind you; including this was a jerk move on Owlcat's part, no question)  that they remove this feature, who have seemingly decided that removing the feature isn't good enough for them. I've seen statements ranging from \"Fire every single person involved in this\" to \"screw this company forever.\" I understand feeling upset about this (and believe me, I *share* in that), but...I don't know. It seems weird to me to go that far in response to a single asinine move that the devs made, which was promptly rescinded. Maybe I'm just more forgiving than most of these people.\n\nI'm going to continue playing the game, eventually. I think I might take a brief break, because...well, while I can forgive the misstep, I'm still a bit frustrated that it happened in the first place. Not enough to throw the game away forever, but enough to need a break.

But the most important thing that I loved in this game is the opportunity to become a real and powerful villain! Demon and Lich mythics are just top!

Recommendable, even, if only barely.\n\nOn the other hand, I would absolutely not recommend this game. \n\nFirst off, the most glaring issue, one which was in the first game but is exacerbated in this game, is the unbalanced encounters. As an example, the very first mission you're given is to head on over to a market square and build a bridge. Neat, right? Well, you do that, go on your happy way, build the bridge. What do you do after that? There's a huge zone to explore, might as well get to exploring, right? Guess what bucko? On the other side, there's an encounter with monsters who do ability damage and cannot be damaged except by magical weapons. At this point in the game, you will probably have one, maybe two magic items between your whole party. Guess it just sucks to suck. In another place, in a house in that same zone, you have the misfortune of meeting a creature in the basement which can only be seen if you can somehow detect invisibility. Didn't make a wizard? Haven't met one yet? Well, sucks to be you, you just can't fight that unless you come back later. That's not the end of this issue, either. These encounters are just legitimately impossible whole-party killers if you're not prepared (at level 2 or 3). These are aggravating enough, but mercifully uncommon. What is not mercifully uncommon is the extreme prevalence of supremely poorly balanced encounters. I've been playing and dungeon mastering pathfinder for years at this point, so I understand that balancing encounters is difficult. The developers of this game took one look at that challenge, and said to themselves \"let's just not even try.\" Every other encounter is VASTLY overbalanced for your characters and their level. For example, running across a medium water elemental in the tutorial which requires you to use every single consumable available to you to have a hope, or running across encounters with multiple demons that are credible encounters for your party singly. Or, when the inn you're using as a home base is attacked by a horde of cultists which never stop coming until you kill a specific set of units, something which is not told to you, or highlighted, except in one single piece of dialog. Then, at the end of the encounter, a boss mob spawns who is massively overmatched not only for your pathetic party, but also every single NPC in the zone that they give you to help you out. I looked up a guide for it, and they recommended a half dozen plus casts of a specific spell. At level 3. For those who don't know pathfinder, that is legitimately 100% of the casts available for a single caster or more at that level. Fortunately you can get past these issues if you have really good luck. Which brings us to the next issue.\n\nTHE DICE ROLLING IS RECTUM-SHATTERINGLY BROKEN\n\nIn the first game, this was noticeable. It wasn't terrible, but it was noticeable. You'd have pretty long runs of mildly bad luck here and there, but it wouldn't be too terrible. Usually you could figure your way through it. In this game, it's like you're using dice which are loaded against you. They figured out how to make dice rolling work back in 2002 with the release of Morrowind, so how the absolute piss have they somehow managed to screw it up THIS BADLY? You can go whole combats without rolling a single hit. If an enemy casts a spell on your party, it is GUARANTEED that you will fail your saves. Roll for damage? Prepare to roll low! The only good thing is that the enemies seem to suffer under a similar, albeit somewhat mitigated curse. How is it mitigated? Well, if I roll a 5, I miss. If an enemy which is vastly over-matched for my level rolls a 5, he hits!\n\nNext, we get to map movement and random encounters. You will have random encounters. You will have LOTS of random encounters. You will use your resources on these random encounters, and you will need to sleep. If you sleep outside of safe places though, you start to get cancer. Sleep too many times, and the cancer becomes terminal, game over. You need to sleep to replenish your resources, and you will likely need all of your resources to deal with the aforementioned overtuned encounters. See how this is an issue? It's just terrible game design.\n\nI personally didn't like any of the side characters in this game, but that's more of a personal thing. Maybe you'll like them, who knows. I didn't get very far in the game before I put it down in disgust, so maybe they get less annoying as time goes by. I doubt it.\n\nWhat's good about this game? Well, the character creation is pretty faithful to pathfinder, with lots of options. It is a ton of fun to theorycraft your character. Unfortunately, if you don't build something relatively optimal, you'll just get absolutely destroyed on repeat. Isn't that fun? \n\nThe game looks pretty good, though it is very resource intensive for what it is. Hope you've got good fans.\n\nThat's all I have to say about it. Don't buy, game is shit.

It's mostly people who played D&D 3.5 of 5e and are screaming that something has some actual rulesets instead of loosely tied together concepts of how rules should be constructed so that they actually make sense.\n\nThe game is incredibly deep in lore, personalities of the characters are distinct and change as you make decisions with and for them. Owlcat does a pretty good job of making reactions realistic, from the low born paladin trying to do what she sees is right and standing by you even through some of the most heinous stuff because it is for the greater good (or leaves, which is its own fun little drama), to the ultra pragmatic Hellknight who will stop at nothing in order to ensure this problem is solved, to the guys who are just getting sucked up into it and trying to make the best of it all.\n\nIt's incredible that people actively scream at AAA companies for having flat, uni-dimensional characters with no progress, growth or change, with uninteresting and predictable stories. When OC gives them a game that has good things, the opposite of what they are complaining about, they scream about how much it isn't \"true to source\" and \"math doesn't work\". Despite having a combat log that will literally break down every feat and aspect that influences the math to see that no, it is all correct.\n\nListen to the people who actually talk about the game, the characters, the development, the story and the play. The idiots who are screaming about inherently optimized characters don't seem to understand the concept that flaws exist, not everybody is min-maxed in real life or in fantasy to do what they want with perfect precision, and it is the flaws, the weaknesses and strengths that help MAKE this game so good.\n\nEdit @400 hrs on first character playthrough: Got dan that was a fantastic f*cking game. I personally didn't mind that the end of it was somewhat 'abrupt', for me it was a trope that was actually done unusually well.

DO NOT TRUST OWLCAT. Crowdfunded game + 2 seasonal passes, but years later they're still not delivering on 75% of what they promised in the crowdfunding or passes...And it's still full of non-optional SPYWARE.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is coming out next month. It's already playable in part for those of us who pre-purchased it and it's gorgeous. Why is that relevant? Well, after the disappointing \"Pathfinder: Kingmaker,\" I was LOVING \"Wrath of the Righteous\", even recommending it to my wife. Figured I'd wait till I'd clocked it before I recommended it here. Then I woke up this morning to discover that Owlcat had implemented a non-optional 26 GB \"update\" to add 3rd-party data-tracking software & change the EULA -- and when people were livid, Owlcat sniffed \"Well, it's standard practice for MOBILE games!\" Screw that. This isn't a mobile game. If you want to change your product THAT drastically after people had already purchased it, you should probably just refund us the money and start from scratch with your new \"mobile game\" audience. Supposedly they'll add another update tomorrow to remove the spyware, but only because A) their customers revolted (hard to sell seasonal passes & DLCs and upcoming games to people who think you're scum) and B) it turns out their spyware would have been illegal under EU law. They as much as admit in their statement on the matter that they'd add the spyware back in as soon as possible. Good to know so I don't waste my time or money on their upcoming \"Rogue Trader\" game, i suppose... If you already own WOTR, don't let it update! I'm determined to get my money's worth since they won't refund the purchase, but I refuse to become their product.\n\nUPDATE: That roll-back update? The one they promised would remove the data-tracking & return the original EULA? Because they were SO sad they'd upset their customers? So far, neither hide nor hair of it -- and other players are reporting a similar absence. Meanwhile Owlcat posted claiming it was out on the 25th. Just a further indication of the kind of company Owlcat has chosen to become!\n\nUPDATE 2: Having played through further without updating, looks like Owlcat also just kind of gave up on the game after Act 4. Starting Act 5 means suddenly seeing a lot of the \"choices\" in the game not matter or be glitched to irrelevancy. E.G.: When I began Act 4 I had placed several characters in jail for their crimes -- it was full. But when I began Act 5, almost none of them were in jail anymore -- i assumed that they had escaped, but nope. I ran into them in their usual haunts and they (and their character descriptions) spoke to me as if they'd never been arrested or imprisoned. It really feels like Owlcat just gave up after a point and trusted that people would have invested too much time to care.", "timestamp_created": 1690228355, "timestamp_updated": 1693859750, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506556391716003418", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1690289592, "developer_response": "Hello!

It's actually a good thing because Pathfinder is not the simplest system, so people that never played a campaign will get lost, a lot.\nAnother thing related to difficulty is that the campaign is a MYTHYC one, your average encounter will be demons, so they are strong, numerous and have a lot of resistances or immunities, high saving throws, ecc.., so difficulty gets worse and worse the higher you set it.\n\nI think I'll update it in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1690220608, "timestamp_updated": 1690269856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501442551612854004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142715455": {"recommendationid": "142715455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010116437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 24944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24944, "last_played": 1690219785}, "language": "english", "review": "The inclusion of an app-tracking spyware in the latest update has made this unplayable for me.

Wasn't expecting to see it here, but fun is fun.\nI disliked:\n-Many of the mythic paths feel like they are incomplete, especially the secret, incredibly buggy one.  Some of the choices you can make in that path don't seem to do anything, and the power you gain is not nearly enough to compensate for losing all companions.  \n-Crusade stats could use a tooltip.  I have no idea what I'm doing to raise my leadership stat, but apparently I'm not doing enough of it.\n-Mariliths and Gallus could use a nerf.  In real-time mode they're not as awful, but in turn-based mode they have an unfortunate habit of taking down max-level characters in one turn, specifically the ones in Iz\n-Some of the classes are straight-up useless.  You will not fare well if you choose the class that specifically kills fae and nothing else, because there is literally one fae in the entire game, and a speech check can make them harmless.\n-Finally, those puzzles are just awful. Sure they're optional, but that just made it worse when I found out that the only reward I got for figuring them out was a useless item that harmed me more than it helped. (a lot like the secret mythic path, come to think of it).\n\nOverall, this game feels unfinished.  It's fun, sure, but don't expect everything it tells you it can do to have been done well.  My advice for how to best play this game? Activate the setting that lets your companions just get up after falling in battle, pick a class that you like the sound of, and just play the game once.  It falls apart under scrutiny, but if you just go through it once, you should be able to miss most of the jank and annoying features.

What a load of garbage. I have never played a Pathfinder game before or DnD for that matter either. I have literally zero experience with either ruleset. Playing this game blind was the first time I have ever dealt with it. Sure is it a lot to learn, yes. Does it take a long time to learn it all, not really. 3-5 days of playing the game and I have a solid grasp on pretty much everything now. I am playing on the core difficulty. So idk about hard or unfair but on core I have made it to the start of Act 3 without issues. I didn't look up shit. Just learned the mechanics, made solid builds by using my brain cells which seems most people in the review section seem to lack, and learned from my deaths. My main toon is a Caviler and I am playing with Seelah, Lann, Camellia, Ember, and Woljif. I haven't multiclass'd with any of them. Kept them straight down what they started as. All of them feel strong and good at different things to me and most battles I have zero issues with. Buffing up before a tough fight is not unique to Pathfinder that is common in basically any rpg. This game is absolutely amazing IMO. One of if not the best CRPG's I have ever played. I have played a ton of them. POE series, DOS series, Wasteland series, Discyo Elysium, Enslaved, Shadowrun series, etc etc... This beats them all for me. TLDR - If you enjoy CRPG's and have a brain you will love this game.

This is enough to hit the recommend button, but it's critically close to pressing that red \"No\" button. Act 1 and Prologue are amazing, the game really builds up something great, characters you meet are interesting, and the final battle of Act 1 is very thrilling and fun.\n\nAll of this is fine and dandy, until you reach Act 2. This is where the Crusade mode is introduced. I'm a big fan of Heroes of Might and Magic, so this method of battle is known to me. However, it's very bare bones compared to HOMM. For some reason, you can only play with 3 units unless you get an ability that allows you to have more. I have managed to build a relatively strong army and cleaned up all units from the map, it wasn't bad, but I hear it gets worse (I haven't yet played Act 3 at this point).\n\nHowever, I already see issues deeper than flawed Crusade system. The game is very... condescending. Unless you min-max your party, there's no way you can win any encounters. Forget about taking it easy or picking what feels good - you have to break the system making overly crazy builds even to get through encounters on \"Normal\" difficulty. I tried rolling White mage, and gave up during Gargoyle assault where most of my characters kept dying on the way to the temple, and whenever I rested, my Arcane corruption got worse and worse until I had huge debuffs that made me even weaker. There was no way to return to camp, since it was a scripted encounter where the camp was temporarily in ruins, and thus, no way to cleanse my party from corruption. This was the first time I played and it made me gave up on this game for more than six months.\n\nI finally returned, actually googling builds for each character. I managed to find a good page with min-max builds, and now I could finally focus on roleplaying without worrying I would die on every encounter! I wish. Game still manages to pull poorly balanced encounters everywhere I go. There is a Sarkoris ghost on level 16 and his lackeys are all high-level too, and it's at the area where your party is mostly at level 7. It DESTROYS you. Again, I had to Google, some people claimed they defeated him by spamming summons and exploiting the fog of war and ranged tactics. I managed to defeat ghosts, but the ghost annihilated my party with one hit KO spells he literally spammed on my party all the time. I turned the difficulty down, killed him in one strike and turned off the game.\n\nI tried to play it again afterwards, but I just feel appalled. It's not the only overly hard encounter - one random encounter during rest was literally 15 sorcerers all throwing fireballs at me. Whoever made this game was obviously an enraged min-maxer who was thrown out of D&D parties one too many times for being obnoxious with rule lawyering. \n\nThe more I play, more I just feel how much anger was put in this game, from the \"Evil can sometimes  be good, and good is sometimes evil\" nihilistic worldview, to the game forcing its gay characters on you to the point where you have to  actively research forums to know which conversation option will lead you to romance path you didn't desire. I consider myself a liberal person, unless somebody tries to force me into something I didn't ask for. That's not the way to be an ally, or to win anybody's trust or respect. Naturally, romance with female characters is much more subtle, Queen Galfrey even rejects your approach at the beginning.\n\nAll things aside, game is not BAD, it's a great role-playing game with impactful choices, fleshed out world, characters with interesting  stories and fun quests. Battles, aside from few bad apples, really draw you in. Unfortunately, for me, few bad apples spoiled the bunch. I would recommend it to people who can get over pandering, extremely imbalanced encounters and people who enjoy building characters and min-maxing to get through the game.

And absolute freedom in difficulty customization.\n\nHowever, that difficulty is exactly the problem that I want to raise here. The game really forces you to min/max everything. You wanted a fun build? Haha, noob, don't you have the fifty necessary stacking buffs on your party? (and it's not quite straightforward to stack buffs, by the way, you need to know which sources add up and which don't, and then plan which source to get from what, without knowing which spells and items you will get in the future) Then you won't be able to hit these enemies with absurd armor classes that we'll just throw at you. Haha, noob, you didn't stack all of the resistance penetration? Well, then also your magic is useless against those enemies. You thought yourself clever and packed some touch attacks? Nah, this enemy has touch AC above 30, in addition to all of the above. Just git gud. And while you are not, proceed watching how your whole team needs to roll nat 20s to hit, while your frontline is literally dying one character per round to the absurd amount of attacks from the enemy that is not even a boss.\n\nSo if you come to the game without familiarity with Pathfinder, and try to build your characters on the fly (which is exactly what I liked about the game), at some point at the end of Act 2 you find out that you better go to difficulty level below Normal for these encounters. So I'm really glad that Owlcat games put those difficulty options. They still could've made a more balanced encounter design, though. Because to play on any higher difficulty, you probably should forget about the amazing character customization part of the game, and just google those min-maxed builds and run with them.", "timestamp_created": 1690047877, "timestamp_updated": 1690047877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142592901": {"recommendationid": "142592901", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965021440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 133616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126307, "last_played": 1696969052}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best RPG I ever played. 2105 hours at the time I am writing this text.

It's not my favorite game of all time, but it's the game I have the most hours in outside of an MMORPG, but unfortunately it's not for everyone. It's not even for all cRPG fans.\n\nPros:\n1) There are a staggering number of classes and sub-classes. Multi-classing is available and encouraged. Whatever you can dream can be built.\n2) Massive campaign with a dizzying number of personal choices that significantly alter the way the story unfolds.\n3) Supports both turn-based and non-turn based combat.\n4) Excellent story with rich lore and deep, complex characters.\n\nCons:\n1) Too much reliance on levels, especially for spellcasters. Spellcasters don't just get additional spell slots per level up, the duration of their spells is also tied to their caster level. In the early game, essential buffs like Shield of Faith and Bless only last for a couple of minutes which leads to either chain resting or slogging through combat unbuffed. By the later levels, caster levels make these spells effectively permanent.\n\n2) Far, far too much reliance on buffs. By the end of the game, your spellcasters aren't bringing impressive nukes or crippling control spells (although they can). They're bringing primarily party buffs. The \"essential\" buff list is absurd. By level 7, you'll be casting upwards of 20+ permanent/semi-permanent buff spells and another 10+ temporary buffs in combat.\n\n3) Noob traps are absolutely everywhere. You get a lot more out of this game by following a guide. Describing how and why there are a lot of noob traps would be a book on its own, but I'll be as brief as possible. Most sub-classes are redundant to other class/sub-class combos that do line-for-line the same thing, but significantly better. Spontaneous casters get access to magical items that teach whole spell lists to them, negating their primary disadvantage to prepared casters. Non-stacking buff categories plague the game everywhere, and some of them have similar names, but do stack like Natural Armor bonus and Natural Armor enhancement bonus. Noob traps also flood the combat system which I'll talk about in the next point.\n\n4) Entire playstyles are presented as possible, but don't work in game. For example, starting as a lightning caster you aren't told that all demons are immune to lightning. 90% of the game is immune to poison, but poison spells, abilities, and sub-class archetypes are included. Nearly all enemies have ridiculous and impossible levels of spell resistance and saving throws, especially bosses, giving all difficult enemies two separate and independent areas with which is fully and completely ignore the abilities of your spellcasters (another reason you should use your spellcasters for the significantly stronger and more effective buff spells). There are ways around these limitations, such as Mythic Talents, but it turns the super neat Mythic Path system into a game of \"how can I get enemies to stop fully negating my build?\", rather than cool enhancements. Oh and did you know Armor is useless? Not only are the total armor class maximums significantly lower than unarmored, \"pajama\" tank counterparts, armor comes with insane movement and skill penalties that most of the classes designed to work with armor have no real method of overcoming and have the inherent weakness that actual armor doesn't add to your \"touch\" AC, meaning even when trying to use armor despite how bad it is, several enemy types ignore your armor AC anyway.\n\n5) Mythic paths really take the role-play out of your characters. In this regard, the narrative structure of Owlcat's predecessor, Kingmaker, really stands out. Mythic paths not only determine how your campaign plays out, they have alignment restrictions which decide what kind of person your character is. What's worse, is there are insane gaps in the power scaling between Mythic paths. For example, Angel and Lich get access to unresistable nukes that are AoE, have unresistable damage types, and embed unresistable control spells. These are not just the best spellcaster Mythic paths, the Mythic spells provided are so good they make the spell lists provided from your character classes inferior in every way, aside from the essential party buff spells.\n\n6) Difficulty scaling is absolutely broken. The base difficulty is, fortunately, easy enough that a blind run can be muddled through with some save scumming, unless the player makes some truly unfortunate build decisions. However, the game, including combat encounter structure, doesn't really come alive until you're playing on Core difficulty. Once you start optimizing, the game becomes utterly trivial after leaving Kenabres. The gap between optimal party set ups and sub-optimal ones is the gap between gods and insects. For context, it's the difference between a 30% hit rate and 95% hit rate. It's the difference between tanks with a 30% chance of being hit and a 1 in 400 chance of being hit. It's save-scumming 7 turn combat to make it through, and one-turn killing all enemies on screen. \"Unfair\" difficulty doesn't help, as all it does it make it so you need an even larger reliance on buffs to overcome the obscene armor classes of enemies and if any party member is directly hit by an enemy, they are likely downed in one hit. Any party member that doesn't have munchkin levels of armor class might as well go naked. \n\nOverall, WotR is an excellent, but very flawed cRPG. It has an incredible number of complex, overlapping systems that players require deep knowledge of to tackle the higher difficulties. But with that complexity comes replay-value as you master the layers and learn the system.

Just as in king maker all the extra stuff is not that fun. This is like a 12 year olds power fantasy game.  I also feel like it become bloated with excess crap. \n\nTo get into some details of what i like and hate.  You have what is it 199 class/subclass and thats not counting super awesome magic mythic magics!!! on one hand i like options, on the other you can cut half of them and not know it. So many are just slight tweeks that make something suck a little more that hardly effects game play. \n\nKing maker was iffy on the RNG/prebuff/meta BS but this game leans into it so much more. If had fights in the early game go as this. I stomp them or there is one guy in the group that can solo my whole party. The amount of times you run into things 2/3x your lv in the early game is a bit much. And thats even on lower difficulty. It very much feels like this game expects you to cheese spam every fight. \n\nThis games balance is god awful, like omg.. WTF. slightly strong enemies give such a massive boost to AC. They need to give you a better difficulty adjuster rather then the large stat jumps we see and the bad guys one shot you and you cant hit them.  This is one of the most unbalanced games ive ever seen in the early game. \n\nBe more respectful of my time! From king maker to this i can tell you expect us to prebuff with alot and save scum in this game. Dont make things expecting me to reload a fight when it goes tits up, and it will. At first I like that the baddies did more then just spam simple sword atk, but you still set so many numbers too high.LV10 guy on my lv4 party.... it's very clear you're expecting us to \"cheese it \" and \"save scumb\"\n\nOne thing that gets me about this game is the \"help\" people offer , its often  them gloating when this games less skill more RNG just saying.. or people pushing tactics that are very cheese/rng. It's like in another game i played and enjoyed a bit, people would just say, \"use the death fog barres and teleport insta kill/win\" is that..fun? its not to me. Or just keep reloading a fight untill you make the thing laugh on the ground for so long and burst it to death before he swings at you as.. every time he hits you , someone dies.  \n\nAnd thats another point, if they hit you, you die. Dont make a tank no no, make a clothy dodge person, the trick is not to get hit. buff to all hell so they cant hit you. armor is for noobs! Im sick of the same people who talk about how you just need to learn the game then suggest a few mobs that fix's the game. \n\nIm told this game is not like pathfinder at all. IDK about that ive been wanting to play pathfinder i have the book but after this, im just gonna keep with 5e. I hated the king maker part of kingmaker but i loved the game play. This one, so far, its just poorly made/ balanced and kinda bad combat. This is not a game of skill, its a game of cheese/ abusing the system and taking advantage of cheep crap.

If you're not familiar with TTRPGs mechanics and the mindset you should have while playing this games are a lot harder than they actually are. \nHaving said this I think this is a fantastic game, although a bit unfair at times (I\u00b4m looking at you Azata mission in act 3 and Azata boss fight against Mr. M)\nThis is my experience after going trough the game one time and a half (First run Azata, second, Demon).\nThe beginning of the game is much more manageable than in Kingmaker and feels a lot more engaging and it gives you time to get used to the game, trying different builds to find your ideal one and peeking your interest for the mythic paths.\nBut is after that that the game shows it\u00b4s true face. I liked the crusade management part of the game, although I know that won't be everyone's cup of tea, making my army stronger and stronger and making decisions in the council is one of my favorite parts of the game.\nSome of the battles to come are RUTHLESS, specially the first time when you don\u00b4t know what to expect or if you don't know how to build a good character (I had to reespec more than I\u00b4d like to admit) but once you get trough them are very satisfying, even more thanks to the music of the game. I'm not one to remember specific tracks but the main theme alone gives me goosebumps.\nThe main story is very good, and the voice acting is really appreciated since this game has a metric ton of dialogues that would get very dense without it, but i can't say the same for a lot of the side quests in which i would find myself skipping over the dialogue because i wanted to get to the fights and be done with it.\nThe big puzzle quest felt very obtuse since I couldn't understand the puzzle until I looked it up online, but it has my third favorite boss battle in the game.\nMy biggest problem is with some of the companions, who I found either had boring stories or barely had a story. Like Seelah, Trevor, Greybor, Lann and Ember (after the second act hers is one of the bests)\nI can only imagine all the content I've yet to enjoy (or suffering in a good way) in future playtroughs and in the DLC but for now I can only recommend this game.\nGameplay: 8/10\nStory: 9/10\nBalace: 7/10\nMusic: 9/10\nDeus Vult: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1689791766, "timestamp_updated": 1689791766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142419278": {"recommendationid": "142419278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010342556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1214, "playtime_at_review": 13904, "last_played": 1700638467}, "language": "english", "review": "Great deep RPG with alot of ways to play.", "timestamp_created": 1689789282, "timestamp_updated": 1689789282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142411709": {"recommendationid": "142411709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042071844", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 8935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8935, "last_played": 1689707333}, "language": "english", "review": "Great RPG with a lot of replay value.", "timestamp_created": 1689780750, "timestamp_updated": 1689780750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557749748229980469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142410156": {"recommendationid": "142410156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008735483", "num_games_owned": 776, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 8886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8846, "last_played": 1691958799}, "language": "english", "review": "It took me 150 hours to complete a single playthrough.

Alas, not only would I be lying, I would be doing the game a disservice.\n\nPlaying Wrath of The Righteous is a very jank, very inconsistent experience with certain areas and encounters that can range from annoying to straight up infuriating, bugs that can range from certain dialogue not triggering properly to entire quests breaking, and the entire crusade mode is just a waste of your time, although the actual core gameplay and combat loops, being based of it's namesakes TTRPG, are very satisfying and fun when they are working properly. Oh yea, it is also optimized like absolute trash.\n\nSo, why the positive review? Well, while the \"game\" aspect of this CRPG is nothing ground breaking, it is in the story and narrative that WOTR really shines, and specifically the characters. WOTR has some of the most well written characters of any RPG in recent memory, and the companions especially have fantastic writing, with all but one feeling unique and creative in their own way. [spoiler] Sorry Greybor, edgy \"I'm a conflicted assassin\" is not creative nor unique [/spoiler]\n\nWhile some of the side quests can be a bit... meh, in terms of their narrative and it's impact on the larger world, (These are mainly the fault of backers. Certain backers got rewarded by being allowed to design quests/areas/characters, and they can feel out of place. One such example is Blackwater.) the main story and higher quality side quests are fantastic. You do not need to have played Kingmaker before, or even really dabbled in the Pathfinder universe to enjoy the story, as it does a fantastic job of framing itself and giving you a good footing in the universe.\n\nYou can tell this was a CRPG made with immense amount of love from Owlcat. They truly wanted it to be the absolute best it could be, and it shows in the final product. No, it is not polished, it is buggy, it runs like crap, but by god, the characters, the writing, the narrative; if you are looking for a AAA experience, with a large budget and team behind it, than you are going to be dissapointed. If you are looking for a CRPG that tells a good story, has good characters, and overall has high quality writing that allows you to make choices which actually impact the characters and world around you, than this game will make you very, very happy. It made me happy, after-all\n\n\nEdit: As I am sure you have seen, recent reviews are complaining about a program called Appsflyer temporarily being added to the backend, claiming this is some form of spyware; this is unequivocally false. Yes, Appsflyer collects data on users, but so does your OS. So does Steam. So does nearly every website you visit. You know that little button that shows up when you visit a new website thats asks you to allow cookies? Well guess what, if you accept that, you just gave that website access to a huge amount of information about your web usage. Steam, when you take that hardware survey? Congrats, you just gave Valve a full hardware readout of your pc, going so far as it being able to tell how much free space you have in your hard drive. Use Steam at all? Congrats, you just let Valve know your purchasing habits, what games interest you, and what types of communities interest you. Use Windows at all? Congrats, Microsoft now has access to system wide analytics, including any and all tasks your PC is undertaking, system and software information, along with almost anything else that they could want to know about you. Have Win10 or Win11? Well guess what, Microsoft has access to a built in [b]keylogger[/b] on any machine running Windows 10 or 11. Oh, you carry a phone around you and have a social media? Well, do I even need to explain? Nothing that Appsflyer collects is data that you do not readily give up without even realizing it.  If you are worried about companies collecting data on you, you should not have anything connected to wifi, let alone a steam profile which you make purchases on.\n \nAll yall freaking out about \"spyware\" saw a buzzword and decided to freak out. Owlcat didn't try and sneak Appsflyer in, they didn't try to keep it in once they saw the community pushing back.

Even with that in mind, I can't recommend this game.\n\nYou see, in D&D 3.5 (which pathfinder is based on), to level up, you need around 13 encounters of the same difficulty as the party level. So a level 4 party of 4 needed 13 level 4 encounters. The difficulty of an encounter was set based on the number and level of the enemies, with a single enemy being the same level as the party being the rule. That said, for our level 4 party, a single enemy of level 4 would count as an encounter of level 4.\n\nFollowing that rule ensured balance. As someone who used to DM, this was a very good balancing rule.\n\nIn this game, you play a party of 6, meaning that challenges can be a bit harder. You also have the Mythic path, allowing for even more power to your party.\n\nHowever, the game has too many high level enemies spread out. This makes balancing much harder, as two levels is a big difference (D&D only has 20 levels, so yeah, 2 levels is a lot!). So, putting a level 16 boss on a 9 level party is just insane! The devs knew this, as the default difficulty is not the same as the core difficulty (which is full pathfinder rules). However, even with the nerfs that normal difficulty applies, the level gap can be too much.\n\nAs such, in some levels you'll feel like your breezing through, cutting down enemies with ease, while other times, you'll be frustrated by difficult encounters that feel overwhelmingly impossible. \n\nI was able to power through due to my love for D&D, but the frustration never ceases.\n\nTLDR: Balancing issues can sour the whole experience.", "timestamp_created": 1689554173, "timestamp_updated": 1689554173, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142237223": {"recommendationid": "142237223", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970688559", "num_games_owned": 1176, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1424, "last_played": 1690328895}, "language": "english", "review": "Games in a fantastic state, playing my first playthrough on steamdeck in turn based mode - smooth & very accessible.

Ever. Too much work. This game though- something different. I grew up on Baldur's Gate and the Might and Magic series. This game goes beyond those games.

For one of the 9 mythic paths. For 6 of Many possible classes and further sub classes. Meaning if you like the system and want to know what it would be like to kill everyone you  initially wanted to save and turn them into your mindless slaves- you can do that. Or a number of other amazing or atrocious things. \n\n-Solid combat system with option for turn based or real time. (Although it feels like it's made for turn based.) The combat can be scaled from easy to incredibly difficult and is accessible to newcomers while also providing a challenge for even CRPG or D&D experienced players. This can come in useful if you've played through the game a few times out of curiosity for different paths.)\n\nBasically your take away from this should be that I'm an eternal nerd.

And if you are also an eternal nerd with a strong love for good story telling and at least a little bit of interest in video games- I'd HIGHLY suggest this masterpiece from a smaller developer. Who can argue with that kind of value for your time to money ratio?\n\nThat being said, if you are in it for amazing graphics, quick action and the narcotic like addiction of head shots and M-M-Monster Kills! This is not the game for you. \n\nIf you like planning the decimation of your opponents, starting a cult of compassion and understanding, or just enjoy the feeling of ascending to near godliness while exploring a new world or an old world in a new way, this is absolutely a great buy.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1689477791, "timestamp_updated": 1689477791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142172029": {"recommendationid": "142172029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007693274", "num_games_owned": 844, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 8839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8839, "last_played": 1689475668}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic RPG game weighed down by too many mechanics and too much fluff.

For example, I wish more gear was randomized outside of trickster path, rather than seeing the same things all the time. And transmodifying your gear can be super glitchy.

The biggest downsides are the absolute monstrous pieces of text (fluff), and questionable meaningless time grabbing mechanics. \n\n\n\nNow for the constructive criticism part, i WILL compare this to other games just to give you a better idea of how this should of been handled.  \n\n\nStory: \n\nPathfinder: \nStory itself is interesting but i couldn't give 2 sh*ts about anyone. There is no proper character buildup, no universe introduction, etc. The game just simply bashes you in in the middle of a fight in which you are suppose to understand how things work in that universe... oh and also everything will be expressed under insane amounts of text which will get you to rage skip everything in the first 10 min of the game. I sh*t you not, this game has more f*ing text than actual books and that is really not good. \n\nGames which have handled this properly: \nLook at the witcher series, dragon age origins (or even inquisition), mass effect, Baldur's Gate 3, Skyrim, hell even star wars the old republic. These games have proper story build up and universe explanation which allow you to understand what is the good side, the bad side, dynamics, etc. Same goes for characters. Also these games implement a properly entertaining story telling with meaningful character choice without throwing an infinite wall of text at you. \n\n\nGameplay: \n\nPathfinder: \nGameplay is very nice BUT there is a SEVERE lack of proper autosaves. Who in their right mind can't implement a simple autosave mechanic after each fight is over .... that was literally ABC level of f*kup. \nThis game is (kinda) built with the good old turn based mechanic in mind, BUT they actually allow for a dragon age style gameplay, which is super nice. This said, the game also blasts you with worthless encounters over and over again so in reality for every positive aspect this game has there is an equally negative one. \n\nGames which have handled this properly: \nBaldur's Gate 3 is a perfect example. There aren't a ton of fights BUT each fight is significant and fun. Considering that Pathfinder has a TON of classes, i would of loved to see a game that doesn't act like left4dead and throw hordes and hordes of enemies every 5cm traveled. \n\n\nQuick travel:\n\nPathfinder: \nAbsolute mess. There is a corruption mechanic, a fatigue mechanic and a time simulation mechanic..... guys what the f*ck? All you had to do is pick 1, not all 3. It doesn't even make sense.... If you travel too much you run into fatigue which makes all characters basically useless and you need to rest. If you don't go back to base the corruption mechanic kicks in (if you don't have a proper character to lower that during normal rests). And to top everything off, every time you travel time also passes by (which is used for the Army minigame). \n\nGames which have handled this properly: \nBaldur's Gate 3 is yet again the perfect example. Simple easy quick travel points that don't take away from the fun. Also there are no needless \"filler\" spam fights while teleporting around. \n\n\nInventory & character management: \n\nPathfinder: \nErmmmm it's an item spam fest. Feels like i playing borderlands but i only get white items non stop from everyone and occasionally the enchanted ones from proper stashes, missions etc. I have no idea what items i should be using unless i go and consult the character sheet for every hero. There could of been a better way to manage this by properly adding a few extra lines of code but yeah w.e\n\nGames which have handled this properly: \nLiterally everyone. From FPS games to RPG games mentioned previously to w.e. Games usually run economy through quests and gold looting. Pathfinder runs economy through item hording (it's kinda like skyrim but without all the fun involved, and without looting actual gold)\n\n\nThere are a lot of other problems like extremely bad map design, infinite loading screens, unbalanced as fk classes (just run a beast master ranger with a bear fully built for tank + secondary minions and you will literally blaze through enemies with a small army on top of the party characters. Broken AF).\n\nLike i said at start, the game started off good but got progressively bad because of spam fest and pointless time wasting mechanics, on top of insane fluff of dialogue text. All of this might work in front of a real life tabletop game, but as a video game it's really bad (even thought it had the potential to be extremely good)", "timestamp_created": 1689440772, "timestamp_updated": 1689440772, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526274502277374268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142133919": {"recommendationid": "142133919", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991990207", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1903, "last_played": 1689690298}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is reasonably neat, but it's extremely janky.

Your characters have little chance against the RNG when its so highly stacked against them and they end up swinging about like blindfolded kids with a pinata. The first few rounds of any battle is taken up by buffing and debuffing, while your opponents swing away with 2 or three times the actions you have available.\n\n My mages were pointless as all demons were immune to their spell effects, its normal for them to have resistances against all energy and an immunity to at least one. couple that with immunities to mind effects and slow effects and there really isn't much point in even having mages.

Not much I can buff when scum saving against a DC 15 with a +12 only to get two 2s and a 1.

Where are the other d6s at?? \nThe Crusade mode is just really bad. I mean, if you have ever played a total war game, it tries to be that on the grand map, but it just ends up functionally terrible.

For better and worse.\n\nHonestly, I preferred Kingmaker, but I think that speaks just as much to the quality of the tabletop modules as it does the video games themselves. Compared to Kingmaker, the character writing in Wrath is relatively predictable and tropey, in spite of what I consider a pretty great overarching narrative. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, mind you, I also think that the companions in BG2 were extremely tropey, but Wrath seems to lack the same subtle self-awareness and theatrical finesse that BG2 had. I just don't feel like the slightly naturalistic style of dialogue lends itself as well to fantasy settings as campy theatre - something that I feel Kingmaker did a tiny bit better. But I also have to acknowledge that this might just be a me problem.\n\nOutside of that, the combat and enemy stat blocks are a mess, which is par for course for Owlcat at this point, I suppose.

It's a big step up from its predecessor as well. Most of the rough edges from Kingmaker are filed away now and just generally improved all the way around. It boasts a better story, some interesting characters, some of the best RPG mechanics ever.\n\nAt the same time, most of the criticisms are true. The game overstays its welcome by about 50 hours, that's out of the 166 hours it took me to finish it. You probably won't be doing multiple playthroughs here unless you've got a LOT of free time. The Kingdom Management mode is the biggest culprit for padding out the time, something fans already complained about to the devs with the last game. It just completely kills the pacing and momentum of the story. At least it is very easy this time once you know what you're doing. Another problem is that the secret ending (which is by far the best ending) basically requires a walkthrough.

On the one hand, it's a very good RPG game. One the other hand, it's a needlessly long and annoying RPG game. Summary down below.\n[i]Update: it must be mentioned that developers tried to include spyware in the installation but they reportedly removed it.[/i]\nI'll start with\n[h1]THE BAD:[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*] POOR OPTIMISATION. I had to:\n[list]\n[*]turn SSR and HBAO off (thanks internet)\n[*]forcibly turn tessellation off in graphics drivers for good measure\n[*]reduce GPU clock speed, power consumption and memory speed\n[/list]\nall to stop my graphincs card's fans from screaming in agony as the card heats up to its highest temperature ever witnessed by me. Some neglect was allowed during development on the technical part. GPU usage was close to 100% before and 40-50% after tweaks.\n[*] COMBAT IS DIFFICULT. Having had taken a look at the combat system when I was starting the game, I decided to just play at lowest (story) difficulty, because I'd have to literally STUDY the combat system for several days. And I thought D:OS 2 was difficult.\n[*] GAME IS LOOOOOOOONG. Not necessarily a downside, however, in the second half of my 120 hour playthrough I was getting increasingly tired of the game's slow pace. There's no teleport system ready to use, instead you need to build [spoiler]teleportation circles in outposts[/spoiler] and use them and even those are not available in Act 1. Most of the time you have to walk anywhere you need as far as I'm aware.\n[*] RANDOM ENCOUNTERS. Oh how annoying they are. Any trip more than a day long will trigger a couple of them at least. THANKFULLY, I had a character with high stealth for most of the game that enabled me to skip them entirely.\n[/olist]\n[h1]THE UGLY:[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*] CRUSADE MODE. While I had fun beating demon armies up, it quickly wore off. Roughly every 5 days a demon army pops up, even in a dead end that is not connected to the source of the demon invasion. And then you need to get your army going wherever need be. Only in [spoiler]Act 5, when I sweeped the entire map and destroyed all demon armies could I place my strongest army in a bottleneck close to the demon invasion source and just[/spoiler] camp without having to run around the whole map to catch them. I'd write it as BAD but this mode can be made automatic so that it doesn't require player's input. However, many quests can be failed because of that.\n[*] VOICE ACTING. Or rather lack thereof. It is very sneaky of developers to fully voice first 2 hours of the game and then voice only a fraction of dialogues. It seems only choke points of somewhat important quests are voiced (beginning, key points, ending). But the quality of voice acting is very good!\n[*] DIALOGUES. Sometimes they are very long and it feels like reading an interactive book instead of playing a game. I kept finding myself skipping dialogues of characters or in quests I didn't care about.\n[*] COMPLETIONISTS BEWARE. If you're one, you're gonna have a bad time. Achievements here are hard.\n[*] SAVE BLOAT. The longer you play, the bigger your saves become. In late game one save file can reach 14 MB in size. This applies all saves, including quicksaves and autosaves. If you have 10 of each, it's 280 MB of saves, which slows down cloud sync.\n[/olist]\n[h1]THE GOOD:[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*] CHARACTER DIVERSITY. There are 10+ companions you can have, all of them have different personalities and traits. Everyone else is different too with their own goals, problems etc.\n[*] MAIN QUEST. It was interesting enough. Not going to spoil.\n[*] COMPANION QUESTS. They were interesting too. Not fetch quests, real adventures, sometimes with plot twists.\n[*] INTERFACE. It's quite friendly and well made. There are even 3 colorblindness filters.\n[*] FREEDOM OF ALIGNMENT. Player can be good, evil or neutral and this choice is not forced upon them [i]at first[/i] as far as I can tell. [spoiler]Until mythic path choice has to be made.[/spoiler] Then player should stick to it.\n[*] SWITCH BETWEEN REAL TIME AND TURN BASED COMBAT. Self explanatory. Convenience feature.\n[/olist]\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]\nIMHO, the only way this game can be enjoyable and completed under 100 hours is on easy difficulty, with crusade mode on auto and skipping all quests except main and companion ones. Maybe even companion ones. That way you can get a simple ending and leave it at that.\nIf you have more time, there's a lot of content for you, good luck.\nSome GPU tweaks may be required.\nGood deal on sale with 50%+ off.\n[spoiler]Here it is.

As a fan of the Pathfinder tabletop RPG, I was eager to dive into this CRPG adaptation, and I was not disappointed. With its complex narrative, tactical combat, and detailed character customization, the game offers a satisfying experience for both newcomers and veterans of the genre.\n\nThe first thing that struck me about Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous was its deep and engaging storyline. The game puts you in the shoes of a chosen hero, destined to lead a crusade against the forces of darkness. The narrative is filled with moral choices, political intrigue, and personal dilemmas, making it more than just a typical good versus evil tale. The decisions you make throughout the game have significant consequences, shaping the world around you and affecting the relationships with your companions. It's a testament to the game's writing and storytelling prowess.\n\nCombat in Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is both challenging and rewarding. The game utilizes a tactical, real-time with pause combat system that requires careful positioning, strategic ability usage, and party management. The battles are intense and often require you to adapt your tactics based on the enemy's strengths and weaknesses. The wide range of character classes, abilities, and spells allows for diverse playstyles and encourages experimentation. However, the combat can be overwhelming at times, especially for newcomers to the genre. A more gradual learning curve or additional tutorials would have been appreciated.\n\nCharacter customization is where Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous truly shines. The game offers an incredible amount of options to create your hero, from choosing their race and class to customizing their appearance and personality traits. The depth of the character creation system is remarkable, allowing you to fine-tune every aspect of your character's abilities, skills, and progression. Whether you prefer a brutish warrior, a stealthy rogue, or a powerful spellcaster, the game caters to a wide range of playstyles and encourages replayability.\n\nThe world of Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is beautifully crafted, with detailed environments, atmospheric music, and well-designed dungeons to explore. The game's graphics are not groundbreaking, but they effectively bring the world to life and provide a solid backdrop for the adventure. The voice acting is generally well done, though some characters' performances can feel a bit flat or inconsistent.\n\nOne area where the game falls slightly short is in the user interface and overall polish. While functional, the UI can be clunky and unintuitive at times, making certain tasks, such as inventory management or navigating menus, more cumbersome than they should be. Additionally, I encountered a few minor bugs and technical issues during my playthrough, though none of them were game-breaking.\n\nOverall, Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is an excellent CRPG that successfully captures the essence of the Pathfinder tabletop experience. Its compelling story, deep character customization, and challenging combat make for an immersive and enjoyable adventure. Despite some minor flaws, the game delivers a vast and rewarding experience that will keep RPG fans engaged for hours on end.

The complexity of the sequel is even higher than its predecessor - the number of sub-classes you can play is over a hundred and most of them have quite a bit of complexity to them. On top of that, the game is based on an epic adventure path involving a 100-year war against a demon invasion. To keep up, the player is given access to mythic abilities that increase their power level through the roof but also add a lot of complexity to playing. By the end, your quickbars will be filled with dozens of spell-like abilities that you will need to manage competently to survive against the rapidly scaling enemy stats. Higher difficulties require buffing before fights and min-maxing bonuses and picking the right feats, which takes time to learn so that the first playthrough can be rather rocky.\n                         \nThe crusade management mini-game is a simplified version of Heroes of Might and Magic. Not enough time was spent tuning it, and the difficulty of it ranges from frustratingly difficult to trivial but time-consuming. The crusade mode exists to tie together the overall war against the demons and the adventures of the Knight-Commander and their party of five companions. The recruitable companions are numerous and range from dark fantasy psychopaths to quirky comedy characters, so everyone should be able to find some that they like. The plot follows the table-top action path and implements close to a dozen different endings with multiple quests being resolved in different ways, and each mythic path involves its own minibosses and quests. Even if not every plotline is equally well written and conceived, there's still hundreds of hours of replay value in this game.\n\nThe sound and graphics remain excellent, perhaps even better than in Kingmaker. The isometric view can now be rotated, which is a curse as much as it is a blessing as Owlcat went all in on environmental obstacles that now make many maps tedious to navigate and doors too easy to miss. One area of the game requires rotating to map to open up new passages, which is an interesting gimmick but gets old pretty fast. Battles in real-time feel fast-paced and visceral whereas turn-based mode is more strategic. There are fewer trap encounters and the beginning of the game is better scaled in terms of difficulty than it was in Kingmaker, leading to a smoother and easier start.

The game simply crumbles under the sheer weight of its ambition in so many key ways that it leads to the overall experience being so much less than it could have been. The devs should be applauded for their ambition, and I almost feel bad giving the game a negative review because of how much obvious passion and effort went into it, but at the end of the day, execution matters more than intention.\n\nThe main issues I have with the game are as follows:\n\n- Bloat, everywhere. Far too many combat encounters with far too many enemies, far too many fetch quests with uninteresting rewards, far too many systems (seriously you cannot be a CRPG AND a might and magic clone AND a town builder, please just pick one.)\n\n- Childish writing. This is by far my most subjective complaint, and I have seen others praise this game's writing, but man, it really does feel like a YA novel far too often for my taste. The prose and dialogue can be laughably bad at times, ESPECIALLY in comparison to its peers.\n\n- Cringy companions. They are just awful, most feel like a bad tabletop RPer too autistic to read the room and realize people are becoming really uncomfortable in their presence. There are a couple exceptions, but for the most part, they are the worst companions in the genre by a mile in terms of writing. One in particular feels as if they were designed with the sole intention of being as unlikable as humanly possible.\n\n- Bugs. Well documented at this point, everyone knows it's a buggy game so I will not delve into unnecessary detail.\n\nThere are some things that work about the game, like the build crafting, character creation, tactical combat, and exciting itemization, but they are buried so far beneath a poorly designed, poorly written mess of systems that it is not worth the effort to get to them unless you have an infinite amount of free time and absolutely nothing better to do.", "timestamp_created": 1688182168, "timestamp_updated": 1693012017, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141020372": {"recommendationid": "141020372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035826989", "num_games_owned": 627, "num_reviews": 178, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1688181356}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad start, it doesn\u2019t understand what borderless window is, as the game minimises when I click on the other screen.\nPut in windowed mode and used borderless windowed gaming to correct it.\nCharacter creation is on first look, just a bunch of pictures\u2026 fairly disappointing.

I have played through 3 times, twice I stopped when I reach a darkness enemy near the end of chapter 3 with an obscene power level (ie. it has 51 armor class on normal difficulty), and once I tried continuing into chapter 4, which was a mistake.\n\nThe first 3 chapters of the game are entertaining, it's fun managing the crusade and making decisions. The crusade management is great, although even after all this time there are still game crashing bugs in the combat, for example you cannot kill an enemy unit that has summoned another unit, until you have killed the summoned unit; if you do the game will freeze and you'll have to alt-f4 and load an autosave. There is one caveat to chapter 3, however, there is one quest area that has overtuned enemies to a ridiculous degree. I learned how bad it was on my first playthrough and I intentionally skipped it on the next two, but if you don't know how bad it is you'll probably stumble into it and be in for a bad time.\n\nChapter 4 has you travelling through the worst designed level I have ever had the misfortune of playing in a game. Even while trying to follow a guide I couldn't find out what to do or where I needed to go in order to actually go where I wanted, there were huge sections of the city that I just didn't find, despite looking at a guide and knowing where they should be on the map; couldn't get there.

Most of that might've been because of the atrocious animations, though the fact that I could check every single RPG opening trope 30 minutes in (important character introduced only to die in the next few minutes, demon invasion, PC turning out to be 'the special saviour',...).\n- Actions aren't explained properly and if I didn't already know at least D&D 5E rules I would probably be *very* lost.\n- Even when I knew what actions I could take, I have no idea how to do what it is I wanna do. I simply don't. I went to use a feat, tried right-clicking, nothing, left-clicking, it lit up, and... nothing else? That was it? Is it working now?

So this game.\n\nThis game made me mad for the first 20 hours of gameplay. It is normal for me to play and replay intros to test out my characters, builds and etc. I did it a bit less here because the introduction is absolute fucking horse shit, it is one of the most painful things i've had to endure in a CRPG. It is long, has little freedom of movement and hides you away from 95% of the fucking game.\n\nNow, there are 2 introductions, the actual real one, which is like the tutorial, and the first act, where you need to invade the Gray Garrison.\nThe tutorial is sort of fine. it's not as painful as the entirety of the act one. Let me get to that.\n\nThe first act basically locks you inside a city of the game, one that you don't even scratch after finish it. It gives you a lot of quests that hinders you off the actual main objective, which is not clear. Here's some soft spoilers.\nTo finish the act one you need to go to the market and finish some scounting, go back to your safe-house and fight about 30 FUCKING MINUTES OF ENEMY WAVES THAT YOU CANNOT PROGRESS UNLESS YOU SKILL SPECIFIC FUCKING ENEMIES...\nSomething the game, obviously, does not tell you, and caused me to be stuck in it for over 2 hours, in which i died once since my characters are not demigods with infinite resources.\nOnce you do that, you have to find a random ass guy in a library, then show him a random dagger THAT YOU CAN FUCKING SELL so that you can progress through the main quest, but not before you find a thiefling in the market square that you rescue and he tells you how to find the hidden entrance to the Gray Garrison. The game does not make this obvious, nor does it help you at all at doing this, seeing as i did eventually found the thiefling, and got stuck in the act for over 10 hours because i forgot i had sold the FUCKING DAGGER that was NECESSARY to progress in the game.\nMind you that the dagger is expensive to buy back, so you can add a couple hours of pure grinding to your schedule if you are low on money, since this is the initial area.\n\nThis game is a bitch. I like to play games on the \"core\" difficulty and this game made me pissed, because half the problems it threw at me were unfair. Not normal, nor hard, UNFAIR.\nBy act 2 almost everysingle enemy is a higher level than you, all of them have high stats, and most use spells and tactics that you cannot really counter. Like going invisible and spamming summon monster, or undead creatures spamming inflict mass wounds (Which heals them and deals AoE damage).\nIt got better once i got a party of 6, unique characters, which i forced myself to cheat to get, because the higher your level is, the more expensive it is to buy theses characters, to the point it can take hours to grab a single one. So fuck you for wanting to play your own way, with your own characters. Instead, watch the game force their characters down you throat and expecting you like them after the game spat on your face for over 15 hours by this point.\n\nOnce i got the party of 6, the game turned into more of a fair play, and i actually started to enjoy it more, even if the unfair problems never went away.\nThe game throws you level 20 bosses, that attack 6 times and 2 attacks being enough to kill or heavily injury one of your characters, aswell as making your spellcasters USELESS, since pathfinder uses 1d20+spellcaster level and compare to the spell defense of theses enemies. It normally works, but level 20 motherfuckers have 31 spell defense, so fuck the 4 spellcasters i have in my party, the 2 of them who have healing spells can be half-useful, but the other 2 who only have offensive? Yeah, they are meat-shields, *WHEN* the boss decides to actually hit them.\nMind you, i was about 1 level higher than expected (Did i mentioned i spent over 20 hours more than necessary in act 1?), and my spellcasters all had Spell penetration feat, and some with greater spell penetration.\n\nI lost it when i had to fight about 3 bosses, back-to-back, at the end of act 2, and the game knows how unfair this is because it is the only time it allows you to rest without you gaining curse.\nWhy in the fuck am i fighting level 20 enemies when i'm only 2/5th into the fucking game? On normal difficulty by now (I could no play this game on core, it was making me insane).\n\nNow for actual meaningful spoilers.\nThe story is also a bitch. I loved kingmaker's story, how soothing it was and how it allows you to be free while also still making you interested in what it wanted to actually tell, sometimes.\nIn here, i feel like the story just exists. I have no reason why i wanna enjoy the characters, because everything else is making me pissed that i wanna bitch back and play the game my own way, which pisses me off even more.\nThey are not bad, this is just how the game makes me feel.\n99% of this game is combat, 0.9% is stupid lore and 0.1% is the characters and their dialogues, which are actually mad great, specially the ideas for things like traps (I'll get to it) enemies set for you.\n\nNow, the problem with the gameplay other than combat.\nExploring here makes you feel punished. Sure, demons are keen and they can lay out some very nice traps, now enjoy EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. CHEST. with anything actually useful in them being guarded by high level (level 15+) enemies or have traps that forces you into combat.\nI liked to explore so that i could AVOID combat, and make it easier, but everytime i do so the games forces me to fight.\nThe single-handedly ONLY situation where this was clever was when the game was punishing you for getting VERY GOOD loot by exposing that everytime you do, your troops are closer and closer to dying. You know? Good game design? Atleast they nailed this situation with that.\n\nThe fact that Stauton is a brain-rot, and so it seems like everyone else who spoke to him.\nAppearently 70 years serving your country does not make people excuse betrayal? Sure, gnomes, dwarves and elves all live a good fucking while. Assuming they did NOT die, and that they managed to spread that he was a traitor for 70 years, and that he suffered for theses 70 years to the point that then, and only THEN, did he decided to betray the Queen again... You know, because he was \"punished\" for betraying her already. My guy, Stauton is a FUCKING cleric (His sheet says so, when you fight him, which is something you cannot avoid), he should have high wisdom and will, can he not fucking learn that betraying the empire AGAIN will only make the rest of his life worse?\nI've seen depressive people think more clearly than that, and you wouldn't expect depressive people to have high will, quite the countrary.\nYou could argue he was being charmed by the demons, but it does not seem so, he was very defiant of them. He just wanted to die and did not have the fucking guts to kill him himself, so now you have to do it bEcAuSe yOu'Re tHe mAin ChAraCter and because the game does not let you convince the sucker otherwise. You have to kill his brother, you have to kill him...\nOK, i guess i am fighting against suicide by killing people instead. Lovely. Something very great for my Neutral good character. I am sure a good person would not get depressed after being indirectly forced to kill someone who was just depressed, because the lore of the world is an ass and because someone thought it was REALISTIC to have people shun you for 70 years of good service, just because you betrayed them once.\nIt's not like it COULDN'T work, they just did not get this to work.\n\nI see the combat, i see the gameplay, i see the unfairness this game is placing before me, i look at all that and i remember that i'm playing a game, and suddenly it doesn't matter.\n\nNow as controversial as this may sound, i am still compelled to play this game, out of rage or pity. I do actually see potential in this, and appearently most of my problems will be \"fixed\" by act 3, which is where i am now. So i feel a glimpse of hope that maybe i can still come off enjoying this game.", "timestamp_created": 1688096276, "timestamp_updated": 1688096276, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588986814022064209", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140938253": {"recommendationid": "140938253", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982477610", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1688647673}, "language": "english", "review": "It doesn't feel like a video game based on D&D, it feels like an actual D&D session.", "timestamp_created": 1688084387, "timestamp_updated": 1688084387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140934252": {"recommendationid": "140934252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006494084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 27311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27311, "last_played": 1673486825}, "language": "english", "review": "The most accomplished CRPG of the last 20 years.

During that time, I didn't bother to touch any other game until my brother introduced me to Pathfinder: WotR. When you start, you will probably be thinking to yourself, \"Well, it's a start. I guess they will make me roam around town first and pick up my teammates before I run off.\" And then suddenly, as you were just enjoying the festival, BOOM! Some crazy shit happens, your jaw probably drops to the floor, you're forced to make your first real major choice, and then that's when your adventure REALLY begins!\n\nAnd things only get better from there. Seriously, the writing is incredible, and I love the attention to detail. The game starts strong, and remains strong all throughout. Almost every choice matters; things that happen in the first chapter could bite you in the ass in the last. As for the companions, they are all amazing in their own way. I got so attached to mine, that I called my team \"The Brotherhood\", because they were all like brothers (plus Seelah!).\n\nHave I ever mentioned how great the art and music are? I really love the music especially. The Azata's theme is my favorite...totally not biased or anything...\n\nI don't want to say too much about this game so you can experience it for yourself. However, before you start, there ARE a few things I recommend following to get the best experience:\n\u25cf Turn off Crusade Mode before you start (enable Auto Crusade in settings). A lot of people think this feature actually bogs down the game for them, but thankfully, you can just turn it off! Poof, gone, problem solved.\n\u25cf There is no shame in looking up guides for the puzzles (I mainly stuck with the wiki). A lot of them don't have hints. Unless you're a nerd and you wanna solve it, be my guess, but I always hate puzzles in my games.\n\u25cf There is also no shame in lowering the difficulty if things get unfair, and you're ready to just progress. It's a CRPG: of course it will have its unfair moments.\n\u25cf Don't skip out on your companion quests. Not only are the companions so well written and charming, their stories will tie in together at the end.\n\u25cf Apparently some people hate Nenio right off the bat and try to kill her?

If you enjoyed the old school Baldur's Gate from a purely gameplay aesthetic, and did so in recent years - then you may find something you enjoy here too.\n\nHowever, that's not yet mentioning the flaws. The UI is terrible and unintuitive, you will fiddle finding certain magic options, you will be wasting turns or abilities for no reason no matter how careful you are and the UI will sometimes glitch out at random like a mouse-over popup refusing to close.\n\nWorse yet is how much this game feels like a scam, to me, personally. It baits you with a few cool ideas, characters and dialogues. Make no mistake. This is a trap.\n\nVoices:\nThe game is voice acted in the beginning. After that, it is a coin toss of EA proportions whether or not you get a voiced line of dialogue that isn't combat-babble. And I do mean it - whether a conversation is important or story-centric has no bearing on the decision of whether or not it is voiced.\nThe voice acting is good, but it is so rare it may as well not be there at all, and I am tired of making excuses for it.\n\nArmy Management and Army Battles:\nThey made a separate system, completely unrelated to your actual roleplaying gameplay-loop. While one could say it is nice that they made a dedicated army builder and grid-based strategy game... it is on a level that has been outpaced by titles that are 20 years older. Again, done with good intentions.. but the only reason people suffer it (and not turn it off) is because it yields rewards.\n\nBattles / Encounters / Combat:\nYou will encounter tough fights, especially if you are not Pathfinder savvy. That is fine. However, towards the end of Act 1 this becomes so much worse. It is understandable that boss monsters would be very tanky and layered with buffs - especially when they are truly supernatural like demons. But only moments later, you start encountering random NPCs of no significance which outpace the Boss by a mile and a half. There are several random mooks who are so ridiculously buffed for no reason that you will need specific strategies and classes to even win said fights. There are people online who will defend this. Do not humor them. It is terrible design. \nThese fights do not yield a worthy reward. They are not optional secrets. Some of them are even unskippable and mandatory. These enemies have no narrative reason to be this powerful. Worse yet, they aren't even mechanically feasible to be this powerful. It is, quite literally, the developers putting a cheated enemy in front of you.\nDon't hold your breath that this will get fixed - the past few changes to these fights have only made them more unfair (note I did not say harder. They aren't hard. They're easy if you employ broken tactics. They're just unfair)\n\nTime Pressure:\nThe previous issue is made worse by this. Sometimes the game will warn you when a quest is time sensitive. However the game will NOT warn you when a TASK within a quest is time sensitive. This means that you may get a worse outcome in a mission by stopping to loot, or taking a rest. The quest is not time sensitive to fail - but it is time sensitive to change... and there is no warning for it.\nThis also makes fights that much tougher, especially the ones mentioned above.\n\nOverall, this could have been a decent game - but to me, it has been a trap. I heard about cool stuff you can do and thought it was novel. Now I am stuck playing the game out of spite.\n\nI wish I could say that you may enjoy this... but I actually just genuinely want to warn people away from this.", "timestamp_created": 1687986959, "timestamp_updated": 1687986959, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501697003841400146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140870015": {"recommendationid": "140870015", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247225649", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 579, "playtime_at_review": 6610, "last_played": 1700482688}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Increible historia, Rejugable hasta mas no poder multiples caminos y clases para personalizacion de personaje de los juegos que hay que dedicar mas horas para apreciar los detalles, Si te gusta el Rol y cosas relacionadas 100% recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1687986398, "timestamp_updated": 1687986398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140862179": {"recommendationid": "140862179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042463013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10880, "last_played": 1689204151}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game", "timestamp_created": 1687976852, "timestamp_updated": 1687976852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140860458": {"recommendationid": "140860458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121173058", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 22007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5017, "last_played": 1692245280}, "language": "english", "review": "Mathfinder", "timestamp_created": 1687974672, "timestamp_updated": 1687974672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140852337": {"recommendationid": "140852337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074200598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 2008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2008, "last_played": 1687964656}, "language": "english", "review": "For new players trying to get into Pathfinder, DO NOT BUY this.

Pathfinder: WotR manages to be tonally perfect through the majority of its runtime, blending grand, epic moments with levity or emotion with ease.\n\n[b] The Good: [/b]\n- The [b] music & voice acting [/b] (especially the voice acting) is phenomenal. The VAs lean 100% into their roles without coming off as comical or cheesy. It does miracles for the immersion and truly endears you to the characters.\n- The [b] companions [/b] and their writing are, overall, excellent. This factor highly subjective (more so than most other game aspects) but outside of one or two companions I couldn't really care for (looking at you, Sosiel) they are fresh, interesting, and their companion questlines are weaved seamlessly into the overall game. They really feel like they're along for the ride with you for their own reasons & motivations, rather than just a tag-along RPG party like so many other games. Minor details like camp banter and reacting to enemies & events while you're going through your CRPG dialogue branches do wonders toward making them feel fleshed out & alive.\n- The [b] tone [/b] is perfect for a fantasy tabletop CRPG. The writing makes the grand moments grand, the humorous moments lighthearted and humorous (without being self-debasing or self-referential \"marvel-movie humor\") and you can really feel the care that went into fully realizing the world & setting.\n- The [b] gameplay [/b] is extremely close to tabletop Pathfinder experience, and can be played turn-based for hard fights, or real time with pause for fodder fights. Enemy variety is solid and, just like tabletop, there are a million ways to break the game in overpowered & fun ways. Difficulty is highly customizable, allowing complete freedom of choice when it comes to playing for powergaming brutal combat encounters vs playing for the adventuring experience.\n- The [b] freedom of choice [/b] is ridiculous. Astounding amount of classes, playstyles, sidequests, and mythic paths allow for a high degree of replayability, although the game doesn't open up in a massive way until a dozen hours in or so.\n\n[b] The Take it or Leave it: [/b]\n- The [b] main story [/b] itself is not particularly worthy of note outside of being a very serviceable vessel for a dozen or so very different branching mythic storylines, depending on your choices with where you want to take your character (Angel, Demon, Lich, etc. etc.). It's solid, but takes a back seat compared to the true star of the show, which is that aforementioned branching freedom.\n- The [b] campaign map & crusade management [/b] are great for making your crusade truly feel like a cohesive, working entity pushing the demons back, but it can take away from the adventuring since you have to go back and micromanage it at relatively often intervals. Thankfully, it can be adjusted to be easier/quicker or just automated entirely. It's cool that the crusade can provide you with benefits and items for your adventuring & vice versa though, and that makes it all feel integrated fairly well.\n\n[b] The Bad [/b]:\n- The [b] campaign/crusade army combat [/b] is like Heroes of Might & Magic but highly simplified and uninteresting. Usually the fight is won by whoever blasts the enemy troops with an aoe spell first. This never really changes. Thankfully, you can just deathstack and if you're big enough, the enemies will run (this is considered an auto-win for you) so it can be over quickly.\n- The [b] city/outpost management [/b] is likewise uninteresting. Each building gives you a minor passive bonus to your crusade armies etc., but since that system is dull too this feels unimportant & like a chore. Fortunately it doesn't take up much time. You usually just dump several income/recruitment generating buildings down and forget about the outpost.\n\nOverall, the positives far outweigh the negatives, and Pathfinder WotR is absolutely an easy recommend for anyone who's looking for a CRPG, a tabletop experience, or as a person's first step into the genre. I'm big into immersion & fantasy escapism, and I was blown away by multiple moments throughout my playthrough.  The characters & experiences I had will stay with me for a good, long while (Woljif has insanely good voice acting, Regill is the most based gnome in existence, Camellia is insane in the funniest way, and tfw no Arueshelae gf).\n\n10/10, highly recommended.

If you don't know what you're doing... if you're still learning the deepness of the systems and are used to more mainstream-titles like Dragon Age inquisition...  then this is like THE ultimate challenge. \n\nFirst of: forget real-time-combat! This games works sooooooo much better with turn-based on. But even then the challenge still remains... the challenge of overcoming armor class and spell resistance. \nSigh... i am so torn about the combat. So often it feels like \"is this spell even worth the try or am i wasting my turn?\". This is the first time for me to start appreciating 4th edition of D&D... cause there is something like \"overcomplex\"... and WotR scratches the limit. \nYeah, i get it, i DO get it - dice roll, chances and all... but IF a spell  -MAGIC, which is by its definition something that overrules reality- doesn't do what it's description says... then why does this spell exist? If it is so easy to withstand it, then it is simply superfluous. Any form of crowd-control barely works... that is on the enemies. But the other way round it so much different... and that is when a game starts to feel \"unfair\".\nWhen you need spell penetration, mighty spell penetration, legendary spell penetration AND use the school of your proficiency to  even slightly hope to do something... then clearly something isn't balanced for non-veterans of the rule-system. \n\nYes, i know what pros would comment now: press \"y\" and look at the sheet, study your opponent'S attribute and skills... and while i do understand and agree on that when it comes to higher mobs or bosses BUT... if i gotta do that for regular or random encounters to be victorious without burning through ressources... then that does not make me feel getting stronger or better. And it does not make me wanna learn it makes combat feel tedious. \nBut at the same time lowering the difficulty too far makes it soo easy it is boring. Some prestige classes are plain useless, others are op.\n\nAnd still, i love the story, the setting, the characters, the writing, little changes (like being able to cancel ones own spells),the customisation, the idea of legendary paths with their own quests and storylines (even though i will most likely never see all the evil ones - like lich or swarm - since i detest playing evil). \n\nAll in all i can't help but love the game... but it IS one hell of a frustrating experience at times.", "timestamp_created": 1687897195, "timestamp_updated": 1687897195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140797619": {"recommendationid": "140797619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042893204", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 12905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12887, "last_played": 1697164517}, "language": "english", "review": "The best modern CRPG on the market, bar none.

An outstanding game that totally captured me with its immersive storytelling and engaging game-play. One of its most impressive feats is how it drew me into the lives and stories of its companions, creating a deep emotional connection that enhanced the overall experience. Each companion feels different and motivated you to continue their quest-line, even across different playthroughs.\n\nAnother standout feature is the inclusion of mythic paths. These paths empower players, granting them incredible abilities and allowing them to shape the narrative and game-play experience to suit their character. I won't lie though, some of the  paths feel less impactful, or less fitting for the overal story,. That being said I've heard amazing things about each path from different people. .\n\nOne aspect that cannot be overlooked is the exceptional soundtrack. The music is nothing short of breathtaking. From sweeping orchestral scores to atmospheric and haunting melodies, the soundtrack enhances every moment of the game, immersing players in it's storytelling and action.\n\nJust like in every game, this has it's drawbacks, such as moments of challenging combat that may feel unfair and a slightly slow start, these issues pale in comparison to the overall excellence of the game. The challenging combat can also be seen as an opportunity for growth and strategic thinking, ultimately adding depth to the game-play experience. Additionally, the slow start serves as a foundation for the epic journey that unfolds later, rewarding us with a rich and immersive world once we push through the initial phase.\n\nOverall, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is an exceptional game that successfully combines compelling storytelling, memorable companions, powerful mythic paths, and a stunning soundtrack. It offers a truly immersive and impactful experience that will keep players engaged and enthralled throughout their journey.

Even though I ultimately recommend it, there are some grave issues I have with it. Those issues are for the most part subjective though. The biggest issue I have with this game is the way it handles difficulty, because if you ask me this game is not difficult at all. It is complex enough to make you think it is, but after you\u00b4ve figured out how to properly build your character, the game\u00b4s encounters, even bosses, become trivial.\nOn my first playthrough I had a hard time getting through the encounters. I tried to figure out the game and its mechanics on my own, rather than just copying builds off the internet so that I can appreciate my accomplishments more.\nThat first playthrough failed miserably pretty fast and I had softlocked myself from continuing without turning down the difficulty. It was fine and expected though so I just restarted a new run and things went a lot better, but in the end it led to the same outcome around 30-40 hours into the game. I was getting frustrated by turning down the difficulty at every boss so I just finally gave in and looked up some builds off the internet, since I dont have the time to keep replaying this game for all of eternity.\nThis is where the game started to crumble for me. I had just optimized the build of only one of my characters and the rest of the game became a complete snooze-fest difficulty-wise. \nThis game is all about numbers. It does not matter how well you play, if your numbers aren\u00b4t high enough you are completely helpless. \nAnother thing is that some decisions can go DISASTROUSLY wrong if you miss one teeny tiny detail or choice hours ago. I mean I understand not getting optimal results, but often it just boils down to \"Oh, you found every defender of the 6 different choices for this camp but ONE? Well, shit dawg looks like everybody is about to die.\"\n\nOther than that it is just a blast though. The characters are written masterfully (Looking at you Daeran, Woljiff, Ember), the story is fun and has some great twists and turns, the Crusade mode is dumb but fun (even though most people seem to dislike it) and the dungeons are well built and challenging. \n\nLike I said, my issues are subjective and certainly did not stop me from putting 200+ hours into it, so the game is definitely worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1687563214, "timestamp_updated": 1687563214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50641024112701416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140581475": {"recommendationid": "140581475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056221880", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 8192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8094, "last_played": 1687720272}, "language": "english", "review": "Owlcat keep hiring people in russia (you can check twitter account of Nikolas Maverick Samborsky)\nThis means that they keep paying taxes there.\nThis means that players' money goes directly into military budget of russia.\nAnd we all know how many Ukrainian civilians are dying every day because of russia's invasion.\n\nOwlcat could have simply exited russia like many other companies did.

Your mage quickly casts sleep, rendering the opponent unconscious and collapsing it to the floor. \n\nYour finest archer nocks his cold iron arrows to deliver the finishing blow- the shot narrowly misses.\nYour warrior charges the unconscious mass to end his tyranny- the blow narrowly misses.\nYour rogue sneaks up behind the incapacitated demon and makes two giant thrusts with dueling daggers- both narrowly miss.\nYour animal companion charges and attempts 4 bone crushing biting attacks- all narrowly missing.\nYour sorcerer equips their crossbow - since this demon is immune to all spells and fires a blessed bolt - and narrowly misses.\n\nThe next round of combat ensues.... as the parody of trained assassins flail futilely with their weapons, the sleep spell starts to wear off. But then a miracle happens - the ranger tries a shot -amazingly, with his eyes OPEN- and finally connects - 1 damage.\n\nThe demon is now fully revived and massacres your entire party over the course of about 8 turns while your team of intrepid warriors swing wildly at thin air. \n\nThe game is F*&$ing stupid.... there is so much good, but the battle mechanics are the worst imaginable.

But my ranger was buffed, with precise shot, my paladin was buffed with a good-aligned weapon.... this was not a build issue.  \n\nThe whole game has been just an uncanny amount of missed attack attempts which means an uncanny amount of TIME WASTED.

You click in one spot, your team goes to another. Keep that in mind when you reach locations with multiple traps around.\n- Pacing issues: locations and encounters often overstay their welcome. At times the game tries to build up tension, but then it throws 5-6 encounters and corridors full of traps that make everything grind to a halt.\n- Lots of encounters where enemies straight up break the rules of the system (instant perma buffs, skills they shouldn't be able to have, inflated stats). It feels more like a homebrew D20 game than Pathfinder.\n- Many of the in-game locations look really generic and uninspired, which is again, a consequence of the scale being way too big, and Owlcat not being able to add a personal touch to everything.\n- The particular RNG engine used has a tendency towards multiple low/high rolls in a row. It's random enough in big groupings, but can feel really frustating and unfair at times (it's as bad for enemies though, if that makes it any better).\n\nOverall, it feels like Owlcat has not learned from their past mistakes. Monster stats are completely rewritten again - yay for enemies with 70AC, 10+ attacks dealing 100+ dmg per hit, with 30+ magic resistance and immunity to most negative statuses. And no, that's not an exaggaration.\nYou HAVE TO play around with the difficulty settings to make it work in any sort of way, otherwise it's just reloading until you get the right rolls.\n\nThe story is fine, but making the stakes so high hurt the relatability A LOT. Companions are EXTRA quirky this time, they're not bad however, and probably the highlight of the game overall.\nOn the good side - it looks better, there's more and nicer cutscenes, more biomes and an insane amount of possible builds to try.\n\nI wish I could recommend Wrath of the Rightous, but... no.

Further, remember that many options including the crusader mode can be bypassed through options if it's not your thing (loved it a lot myself). Also, I would like to add how cool it is that devs stick to their games to the end, like with Kingmaker, their previous title, so the game gets updates to this day of writing and it is undoubtedly a positive point to have with such large projects.\n \nSuch heartfelt and passionately crafted crpg series get a no-question RECOMMEND from me.

It took me awhile to warm up to it (and CRPGs in general) such that I glossed over it when it came out, but after running out of Bioware games, and a playthrough of Baldur's Gate later I totally understand the appeal. In a world where the term RPG gets thrown around to describe surface level action-adventure games its nice to see certain devs still hold onto the proper tenets; reactivity, choices & consequences, roleplaying.\n\nNow onto the problems, the difficulty level of this game is a rollercoaster mess and due to the tabletop based nature there isn't much you can do about it other than pray to RNGeesus, reload and try again, or knock it down a notch which always feels bad.

So I ask, why not do a little streamlining, do we really need 50 billion spells that are functionally useless because the enemies save against them, do we really need to use a buff mod to make buffing actually enjoyable?

Which does it great credit, since I don't tend to stick to (single player, linear) games that long usually without losing interest (I usually either devour such games or drop 'em after a few months).\n\nThe complexity and depth of the Pathfinder ruleset, the amount of party customization and the staggering volume of content are the game's biggest highlights. The dozens of (sub)classes, the ability to multi-class and the separate mythic class progression system had me scratching my head many times over. For the first third of the game or so I stuck to a guide, and once I started putting dots together myself I reset my character and build my own 'slayer Trickster' which turned out to be a mighty combination. Using some mods, I was also able to respec my companions as so to have a larger degree of customization. \n\nCombat takes a long time if you play in the turn-based mode (like I did). I often had sessions in which I'd only have one or two combat encounters which might last for an hour or so. This didn't bother me, since combat was generally entertaining. The realtime combat alternative didn't entice me, didn't really try it either, so I can't really speak on it. The game started to drag a bit towards the end, especially once I hit level 20 (the maximum) and there was no more character customization to look forward to anymore. But at that point I was 150 hours in, at which point most cRPG's become a chore.\n\nI didn't care too much for the story and plot although I do appreciate that the developers took the time to write alternate story sequences and endings for the various mythic paths. The plot misses the 'party of heroes travels the world' feeling that games such as Baldur's Gate evoke, mostly because the player is, much like in Pathfinder: Kingmaker, responsible for much more than their merry band of killers and adventurers.

The premise of battling demons in an RPG setting seemed promising, but the game falls short when it comes to allowing players to explore their character alignments in the game universe.\n\nOne of the major drawbacks is the requirement to obey women leaders throughout the game, regardless of whether their values align with your character's alignment. This limitation particularly affects Neutral Evil characters, who would naturally be inclined to prioritize gaining power and wealth from defeating the demons as their rivals. Unfortunately, such options are not adequately presented, as all other choices, including the Queen, seem inconsequential and uninteresting.\n\nIt's apparent that the development team may have faced budget constraints, as creating a true branching story with pathfinder alignment choices can be quite costly. However, the allocation of resources seems to have been skewed towards promoting diversity based on macroeconomic principles, which has resulted in an unbalanced representation of character demographics. The excessive prevalence of gay and female characters feels forced and not reflective of a realistic game universe, and it may come across as an unnecessary political statement.\n\nWhile it's possible that the DLC offers more content and depth, I personally hesitate to invest more money in a game that seemingly promotes a political agenda that I disagree with. As I progress through the rest of the game, it becomes increasingly apparent that it lacks the essence of a traditional RPG and instead feels like a vehicle for left-wing ideological indoctrination disguised as a demon-themed narrative.\n\nIn contrast, I recall running a Rifts Dyval campaign in the past, where I allowed my players the freedom to make their own choices based on their selected alignments, without imposing my personal religious beliefs on the story. This flexibility is fundamental to the nature of a game, distinguishing it from a cult.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are a fan of pathfinder mechanics and are unconcerned with post-modernism and subpar storytelling, this game might still be worth your time. However, if you are an older player who finds left-wing politics unappealing, I would recommend avoiding this title.", "timestamp_created": 1687016074, "timestamp_updated": 1687016074, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421631008386611938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140219366": {"recommendationid": "140219366", "author": {"steamid": "76561199022675608", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5048, "last_played": 1687010999}, "language": "english", "review": "I really loved this game!

Ultimately, it balances out to be positive, but I think that the negative has to be noted as well. Right up front however, be aware that Pathfinder is a combat-focused system and this game adheres to that notion. If you are not a fan of combat-centric CRPGs, you will not enjoy this game.\n\nSo for the positives, the game is a lot of fun to play and overall very polished. I would consider a [mostly] faithful adaptation of the RPG, and it works very well in a virtual world. The story is engaging at time (more on this later) and your companions are interesting enough where you actually care about their stories throughout the game. \n\nThis being said, this game is absurdly difficult to learn. If you don't want to be stuck to following builds you are either (1) going to have to essentially have a working knowledge of the Pathfinder RPG rules, or (2) play on a low difficulty setting. There is functionally no way to understand the rules from within the game itself - you will require outside sources to understand exactly why some things work the way they do and why others don't. If you are OK with following build guides and the like, then you'll be fine, but if you like to theorycraft then be prepared for some heavy reading. There is also a very clear strategy for buildcrafting [which essentially boils down to give everyone an animal companion and outflank] which gets really annoying real quick because optimal does not equal flavorful. \n\nAdditionally, Act 4 is a slog. There is no other way to say it. I won't specifically get into why for spoiler reasons, but it will be immediately apparent why I say this once you get there. All the others are great, with some areas being better than others, but Act 4 is genuinely difficult to get through and definitely functions as a 'character graveyard.' \n\nI still overall recommend the game because it can be extremely fun for the most part.
