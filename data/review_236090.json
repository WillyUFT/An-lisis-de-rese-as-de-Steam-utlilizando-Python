I had only seen a bit of fanart of this game, so I had zero expectations about this one. And I believe that was a good way to approach a game like this.\nI was pleasantly surprised by the fully-voiced dialogue (Which for an indie game is always something to praise) and wowed by the beautiful hand-drawn visuals (every single pixel of Dust's animations is amazing).\nI'm certainly a big fan of the \"Dust flying around as long as there are flying enemies\" kinda thing. Moreso if there's a chest at the end of that \"flying\" session.\nI'm not much one to comment on the story, but I can at least say it's right up my alley, so no complaints there. Some details felt familiar, some others felt fresh. \n\nThe only couple of minor complaints I have: \n1/- while the upgrades for Fidget's magic attacks are nice, I would have preferred another move or skill for melee combat, since unlike most games in the genre this one's more action-focused. Since you can level up how you wish (with some \"backup auto-balancing\" on the side), I ended up one-shotting everything halfway through the game, but still for variety's sake it would have been nice; \n2/- yeah, since It has a lot of combat, you don't exactly move so fast, and the fast travel being one-sided felt kinda weird at times. However, that also means that the areas aren't that big anyway, so moving fast would mean skipping combat and just speedrunning the game. \n\nOverall, I can see why this has been well-received. It was an enjoyable 15 hours of my life (I have some extra hours of standby time).

Along his journey he recovers his memories and helps different creatures of this world. The game feels really good at controls. It's really a pleasure to slash all those enemies that are coming at you. \n\nA small advise: if you stumble upon some region that you cannot clear (meaning collect all the treasure chests) - don't bother too much. Most likely you'll unlock a new power later, that will allow you to collect that treasure. \n\nPowers are a separate topic. Thanks to the well paced story progression you unlock skills that bring new features to the game, which makes the game completion rather interesting.\n\nOverall - if you like platformers and slashers or like metroidvania exploration style in a fairy antropomorphic world and you are not afraid of slightly weird graphics - I'd recommend you to try this game. It feels good. It plays good. It provides some fun and sad moments.

If you seek challenging gameplay and just skip dialogue even if the story is the main point of the game, you will hate this game. This review has no spoilers, but I will be revealing some information that is not important.\n\nSTORY:\nThis is the main reason why you want to buy the game. The main character is Dust, an amnesiac who is almost instantly joined by a companion Fidget and an ancient wise talking sword, forming the core trio that travels together. The dynamic between the characters is honestly great, and the banter between stoic Dust and emotional big-mouthed Fidget is just comedy gold that made me laugh out loud several times during my playthrough.\nThe story is split into several chapters, with the first chapters being mostly aimless wandering after quest markers and helping people, which later transitions into seeking the truth about Dust, and who he really is. Each chapter ends with a strong emotional beat: a twist, a revelation or just a tough pill to swallow. The emotional beats are great and have a very strong emotional payoff at the end of the adventure. The ending will leave you in an emotional turmoil, absolutely heartbroken, and with a faint hope for a sequel that is probably never going to happen. T_T\nThe theme of finding one's own identity will make not only Dust, but also you as the player, reflect on your actions from the first chapters, and the story conveys a positive message about finding one's place in the world. While everyone can connect with Dust's struggles, this message will resonate mostly with teens/young adults, who are currently going through a similar phase of self-discovery.\nOh, and one more thing: EVERY SINGLE DIALOG LINE IS VOICE ACTED!\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThis game borrows gameplay mechanics from several different genres. It is mostly a metroidvania: you travel through distinct areas, unlock new movement abilities, then backtrack to previous areas to collect treasure from previously unreachable places. It even has a built-in tracker that shows you the rough location of undiscovered treasures, alleviating the need for an online wiki to be open on your second monitor.\nIt also has RPG mechanics, which see you collect XP, gold and materials to craft gear. With these mechanics you can boost your stats and generally make Dust stronger over time. There are also a few sidequests (but not too many) that don't really detract from the main story; they actually enhance it as they mostly take place during the early chapters while you are aimlessly wandering around and helping people.\nAnd finally, the combat. Most of the time, it's just a power trip that sees you cutting up mobs of enemies and collecting plenty of loot. The game has a combo-based combat, but it has only 3 ground combos and 1 aerial combo that are unlocked from the start. I wish there were more combos that unlocked as you progressed through the game. Thankfully, it's not really a problem. By the end of the game, while you will feel proficient in the combos, they have not started feeling stale yet. It also has a parrying and dodging mechanics that you use mostly when fighting big monsters and bosess. And there is also a unique mechanic with Fidget casting a spell and Dust performing a SPIN TO WI- I mean Dust Storm. When these two are combined together, you deal TONS OF DAMAGE.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nAbout 95% of the game's visuals are hand-drawn sprites and hand-painted environments, which allows the game to never get graphically outdated. While the enemies and villagers you encounter are mostly animated using Flash-style animation with skeletons, Dust himself has fully drawn traditional animations and it's very hard not to stare at him while he slashes stuff. The environments are well-painted, but what steals the show for me are the background paintings that are just gorgeous to look at. The few 3D objects you will see are noticeable, but visually they try to comply with the rest of the game's style and don't detract from the overall 2D aesthetic.\n\nSOUND & MUSIC:\nFor me, this is the weaker part of the game. While the combat sound effects are mostly fine and the game plays a sound cue when you need to perform a dodge, there is a lack of sound cues for enemies where the only way to defeat them is to parry them. For non-combat sounds, sounds for important world objects are very satisfying, and while standing on a teleporter, the background music volume goes down as a sign of safety and reprieve from the monster-infested world. Unfortunately, in most areas, there are very few environmental sounds, with only the music playing in the background.\nAnd when it comes to the music, the first forest areas have great, uplifting music that pulls you into the fairytale fantasy world of Dust, but the music in other areas just... didn't do that. It felt like generic music matching the area it played in, but it didn't feel like it had the same identity as the music in the forest areas. It could be just me, but... I feel like music should tie the whole game together, and music in Dust just didn't seem to do that.\n\nOTHER:\nMy playthrough of the game clocked in at 13 hours while playing on \"Tough\" difficulty, the 3rd of the 4 difficulty tiers, and I got almost 100% completion, which makes this quite a short game. But I can confidently say that I enjoyed every single minute of it.\nEven on the \"Tough\" difficulty, I didn't feel like it was difficult to defeat enemies. I just chopped enemies up like nothing and bosses usually fell down under half a minute. The hardest aspect of this difficulty setting was the fact that the only way to heal was to use consumables, which was forcing me to actually use consumables (which I usually don't do), but later on enemies were dropping so many healing items it didn't really matter that much, it was just annoying. I would definitely recommend playing through the game on \"Normal\" difficulty instead.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES:\nI played this game for the first time shortly after it came out, when I was a teenager with no money, sooo... let's say I got a free copy. It was the first game ever to affect me emotionally, and even make me cry during a few cutscenes. When I finished the game, I was left completely broken, unable to process the fact that my adventures with Dust have come to an end, and I just stared at the main menu for an hour, with its sad, yet hopeful simple piano tunes hitting me even harder in the feels.\nThis game gave me a reason to pick up drawing. It gave me a dream to one day construct a game with traditional animations and gorgeous environments, an impactful story what will leave a lasting impact on others. That dream will sadly never come true as I don't have much free time outside of my job, but right now, I am a software developer, and I am still drawing in my free time. And this game is probably the reason why I love artwork with furry characters. I am not going to deny it, this game affected me as a teenager for the rest of my life.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nThis was my second playthrough after 10 years, and I can say that this game still holds up exceptionally well. \nWhile I would objectively score this game as a 8/10, I 100% recommend it. It's gorgeous to look at, the controls are responsive, not janky, combat is a fun power trip and the story (WITH FULLY VOICED DIALOGUE!) has once again emotionally destroyed me. If you give this game a chance, you will begin to love furries and you will regret playing it. Now I need to get my blanket, some ice cream and try to recover from the emotional damage this game has inflicted onto me. I will definitely play it again after another 10 years have passed.", "timestamp_created": 1697989826, "timestamp_updated": 1697989826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544193863868713379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148563166": {"recommendationid": "148563166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038163163", "num_games_owned": 626, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2385, "last_played": 1697834934}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a furry now", "timestamp_created": 1697834975, "timestamp_updated": 1697899350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681916415691375732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148527464": {"recommendationid": "148527464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271734417", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 867, "last_played": 1697786902}, "language": "english", "review": "First things first: There are a few spots where you can tell the limitations of one guy doing most of the work, like the limited animation on the NPCs, and the final level can be a little too chaotic in that it's hard to even see your character in spots.

Whatever, better late than never)\n\nBefore there was Guacamelee, Ori and the Blind Forest and Hollow Knight, there was Dust: An Elysian Tail. Am I suggesting that Dust paved the way for these other amazing Metroidvanias? No. Am I saying that it was among the first in the time-honoured genre of 'Hand-drawn Indie Metroidvania?'? Yes, and it deserves a recognised place amongst its more famous successors. The fact that it was among the first Steam games I ever bought, and my first Indie might colour that opinion though.\n\nThat being said, the game does certainly show evidence of the fact that it was the designer's very first game. On the other hand, it's this good considering that it is the designers very first game.\n\nThis game sits somewhere between a Metroidvania and a linear Action RPG. You progress through six main areas along a mostly straightforwards path to complete the main story, using a simple but expressive (and very stylish) combat system augmented with simple loot and levelling mechanics, unlocking several new abilities that, if you so choose, you can go back to earlier areas or optional side-areas to get some extra loot or find some secrets. You can also complete sidequests for the various one-note, but very charming NPC's you meet across the game. And fortunately, whilst one note, there are at least a lot of different notes - for example, whilst there's four child characters who's personality really doesn't go past that, they're very much still different children. So the characters remain extremely memorable and charming.\n\nAs for main protagonists, you play as the titular Dust, accompanied by Fidget the Nimbat and the Blade of Arah, both of whom you meet very early. Their personalities all bounce pretty well off each other once the dynamic is established - Dust is a deeply compassionate Amnesiac who helps literally everyone, and handles both sincere seriousness and sarcastic wit equally well. Fidget is the 'comic relief' and morality pet of the group, a Naive and earnest little 'Nimbat' who tagged along because she was supposed to guard Arah. She's very much your 'best friend', intensely supportive and optimistic, even if she does question you somehow putting a sheep in your inventory. Arah is the wise old mentor - which, yes, does mean he's the Tutorial NPC. He does however, occasionally weigh in with typically nonjudgemental commentary on a situation - and whilst I won't spoil, on replay much of his behaviour makes a lot more sense.\n\nCombat, as mentioned, is simple but manages to be highly expressive. The game is not claiming to be Devil May Cry, but with attacks that can cover the screen, send opponents flying, or yourself hurtling into the heavens only to bring your foes crashing down, once mastered fights in the game are visual spectacles. And to its credit, the designer did clearly know that the Aerial Dust Storm could be cheesed to fling yourself to great heights - some puzzles or areas seem almost designed to allow you to manipulate this for speedruns.\n\nArtistically, the game is gorgeous, with one main fault. The art is, to my knowledge, entirely hand-drawn and has a distinct style, not entirely taking from any one culture or region enough to conclusively pin anything down. The character designs are very simple, but still charming and distinct, and regardless of whether or not you're a Furry, they remain visually appealing. The backgrounds, too, are also breathtaking, and each area remains distinct from one another, if being a little generic in most cases. The only downside is that, whilst Dust is fully animated, most of the cast uses fairly limited puppet animation, and there's occasionally some artstyle differences (Arah and the Generic Soldier characters, for example, are 3D models whilst everyone else is hand-drawn?)\n\nLastly, the music is also exceptional. Standouts being Abadis Forest, Everdawn Basin and 'I am Dust'. Hyperduck Soundworks blew it out of the park with this soundtrack. Unfortunately, I lack the expertise to lavish praise on this, so I can't say more than that.\n\nAll in all, Dust: An Elysian Tail isn't a perfect game, but it is a damn good one. It's definitely the sort of game that's crying out for a sequel to buff out the few flaws or undercooked ideas and expand on what was already great. And, despite the 10-year gap, Hints and rumours abound, so perhaps we will get one. In the meantime, Dust as it stands is a wonderful game and is highly reccomended.", "timestamp_created": 1697166026, "timestamp_updated": 1697166026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565169394016265869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148052666": {"recommendationid": "148052666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103187346", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1341, "last_played": 1539709645}, "language": "english", "review": "Really impressive 2D hack and slash with a cute artstyle, captivating world, intriguing story, and a beautiful soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1697070193, "timestamp_updated": 1697070193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507089018821716309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148027287": {"recommendationid": "148027287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260694372", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 754, "last_played": 1697033118}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a great game.

It's probably the most boring Metroidvania I've ever played; the story is absolute garbage, and the gameplay boils down to mashing the action button (I won't even mention the absurdity of having a button for left dash and another for right dash). Graphically, I'm not a fan, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel that the cartoonish aspect is rather poorly executed, and the fact that the camera is zoomed in so close to your character not only triggers my motion sickness but also makes the graphical limitations even more apparent. Anything related to dialogue is also a lost cause; I've already mentioned the story, but the side quests aren't any better, and everything feels incredibly \"forced.\" Furthermore, the game constantly interrupts you to explain obvious mechanics or just to say nothing at all: LET ME DISCOVER THE DAMN GAME ON MY OWN.\n\nIn short, it's terrible. I'm completely baffled by the 95% positive reviews; maybe the game has just aged very, very poorly. I clearly haven't finished the game (dropped it at chapter 2 in the caves), but I doubt it gets any better from there.\n\n\nFR REVIEW:\n\nA part la bande son, il y a pas grand chose \u00e0 sauver.\nC'est probablement le plus ennuyant des metroidvania auquel j'ai jou\u00e9, le sc\u00e9nar est nul \u00e0 chier et le gamplay se r\u00e9sume \u00e0 marteler la touche d'action (je parlerai m\u00eame pas de la stupidit\u00e9 d'avoir un bouton pour le dash \u00e0 gauche et un pour le dash \u00e0 droite). Graphiquement pas fan, je saurai pas expliquer ce qui me d\u00e9range mais je trouve que le c\u00f4t\u00e9 cartoon est assez moyennement r\u00e9ussi et le fait que la cam\u00e9ra est zoom\u00e9e \u00e0 fond sur ton perso non seulement trigger mon motion sickness mais en plus rend encore plus visible les limites des graphiques. Tout se qui touche aux dialogues est aussi \u00e0 jeter, j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 le sc\u00e9nar mais les qu\u00eates annexes sont pas mieux et tout donne un sentiment ultra \"forc\u00e9\".

Le 95% d'avis positifs m'\u00e9chappe totalement, peut etre le jeu \u00e0 juste tres tres tres mal vieilli.

Our amnesiac gains a new friend and ally named Fidget and a talking sword Ahrah. There are some side characters but they are not very noteworthy, except for the mysterious shop vendor and the main antagonist of the game. The main story revolves around Dust and Fidget and their journey as they slowly piece together what is going on in the world. There is an unexpected twist near the end of the game, near the 80% mark. It\u2019s interesting but not explained in much detail: simply dismissed as powerful magic. The ending is satisfying, but there is some sequel baiting at the end credits scene. But seeing this game was released in 2013 a sequel is unlikely.\n\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nHack and slash gameplay with combos is the main gameplay element; coupled with new traversal abilities. I played on normal difficulty and initially, up until the 70% mark enemies were manageable. After that point enemies become damage sponges. I realize it's a hack and slash game but these levels require much more  tedious hacking and slashing. So much so that gameplay became tedious and more like a chore. The later stage enemies such as soldiers are especially difficult and grindy. Another issue I had with the game was resurrection crystals, as they would be auto used if Dust fell in combat. Instead of being able to choose to use them, e.g. in a boss fight, they would get used up in a meaningless fight with fodder enemies. These crystals are also exorbitantly expensive. Another issue was the cost of the healing items. I had spent so much cash on those that I had no cash to craft any upgrades. I collected all the upgrade materials along with the blueprints required to craft the best armor and weapons only to find that the blacksmith charged thousands upon thousands of coins to craft these items. I had to finish the game without getting to see a single upgrade. The parry mechanic was not very precise. Sometimes the parry worked and sometimes not. Also instead of dropped items getting sucked in towards the player I had to use Dust to mop the ground to collect all the scattered material and coin drops. The mini map was just plain bad; that set of cubes that was in place of the mini map is simply not enough, especially in a genre that requires backtracking. Due to this I did not bother to backtrack. \nApart from these issues, combat was enjoyable. Fidget\u2019s attacks did significant damage and helped take the pressure off from Dust. Puzzle solving and getting to hidden areas was also fun and required some creative thinking.\n\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nNothing to complain about but nothing to praise either. The graphics and art style got the job done here. \n\n\n[b]Controls[/b]\nPlayed using the Xbox controller attached to the PC. Parry mechanics registered at certain times and not so at other times. \n\n\n[b]Side Missions[/b]\nThere are a few side missions in this game. But they are fetch quests and I had no motivation to backtrack as the mini map was not clear.\n\n\n[b]Music/Soundtrack/Voice[/b]\nDust, Ahrah and Fidget\u2019s voice acting are done well.

The locations are vibrant and the story enjoyable to experience.  There's an emphasis on combat, with many areas teeming with enemies, but even on Tough difficulty, the adventure is very manageable, especially if you take the time to beat up every enemy as you explore.  A solid game overall.\n\nThe Full Review:\nDust an Elysian Tail presents as your standard Metroidvania indie game with a bit of a beat 'em up flair, but to me stands out thanks to it's art direction and style.  You play as a character named Dust, guided on an adventure by a mysterious talking blade, Ahrah, and it's flying guardian, Fidget.  Dust recalls nothing of his past, but as you progress, you learn the truth of his past, and of the events unfolding in the world around you.  The dynamic between this unlikely trio, as well as some of their interactions with other characters, was a highlight of the game for me.\n\nThe story is straightforward but enjoyable nonetheless. And if you don't bother to collect every hidden treasure, you can probably breeze through the story in a few hours. However I can't help but feel more could have been done to fill in the story.  More insight into the mysterious Moonbloods, explaining the motivations behind General Gaius's campaign, learning about Fidget's clan, or fleshing out the backstories of some of the other main characters would've been welcome, in my opinion.  I completed my playthrough satisfied overall but still craving to know a little bit more about the game's world.\n\nGameplay and combat is satisfying overall as well, and for the most part you'll probably slaughter most enemies like it was your birthright.  My only gripe with combat is that the parry mechanic felt a little odd, since you parry by holding the melee attack button at the proper time.  I would've preferred it to be on its own button, but it functioned just fine nonetheless.  Dust's walk speed is also a bit slow, and his jumps and dodges felt less nimble in comparison to other games I've played recently (notably Ori and the Blind Forest).  It was cool because it made Dust feel like he had weight to him, but it did make some of the platforming sections feel a little clunky.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm glad I finally got around to playing this game.  I remember trying the demo WAY back when it released on the Xbox 360 and finding it enticing, but never bought it back then.  I'm happy to have found it here on Steam.  If you want to enjoy a charming Metroidvania-style adventure on a lazy weekend, in my opinion, Dust: An Elysian Tail is a perfect game to play.", "timestamp_created": 1692861108, "timestamp_updated": 1692861108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144902210": {"recommendationid": "144902210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006530348", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1046, "last_played": 1695181247}, "language": "english", "review": "Great platform game.

This an E 10+ game for E 10+ gamers.  \n\nFor this, I can excuse the voice acting for being hammy and the skill floor being pretty low on all but the higher difficulty settings and challenge areas.  As a completionist, I'd say Tough difficulty was good but that the game is probably most enjoyable on a lower setting.  Backtracking through swathes of samey enemies would have gone smoother.  \n\nThe tale this game has to tell does not break new ground, and its twists, almost all foreshadowed, seldom surprise.  For a kid's game, I accept such detriments.  However, this does not give the player much to meditate upon when backtracking and exploring through the aforementioned swathes.\n\nDespite the underwhelming difficulty, I certainly saw potential for a high skill ceiling.  If ever there were a sequel that I had any say in, I would venture to appeal in this direction.  \n\nSounds and music are beautiful.  The menu and saving sounds remind me of *Ys Origin*.  The art drips of style, and the colors hearken to the likes of *Bastion*, which this game gives a nod to.  Lip flaps on the talking animations leave a bit to be desired at times, but I tend to nitpick that.", "timestamp_created": 1692328069, "timestamp_updated": 1692328069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144457012": {"recommendationid": "144457012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024962947", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 199, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1692326652}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought the game ten years ago.\n\nMight have liked it had I played it then, but after playing games that far exceeded it in quality (Muramasa is the first thing that comes to mind), I can't recommend it.

However, that was just the main cast, and in particular i was annoyed at Fidget. And i was very surprised to have my first impressions over fidget change : \nThe side characters, their designs, and the two other main characters managed to be so utterly atrocious, cringeworthy and painful to witness, that fidget actually somehow manages to be a more interesting and fun character than everyone else.\nTheres nothing inherently wrong with childish-styled animal-people characters. But the ones in this game, much like their dialogue and story, just fill me with pain. They're not like the ones in pieces of media that anyone of any age, even adult ones, can still enjoy. It just extremely insanely cringeworthy, and i dont even think that kids will enjoy these characters very much either.\nThe main character and the talking sword in particular are awful, they feel like a 12 year old wanted to make the cool badass and somewhat edgy character, then decided they wanted the character to have some soft moments.\nThe worst thing is when you have a game and characters that are basically impossible to take seriously, and then the story tries to have more mature elements and death. I realised i couldnt put up with the cringe after i defeated the first boss that had just massacred the a village, somehow made the mc feel bad for him with their dialogue that started edgy and suddenly turned into a sob story, and then the dialogue ends by the two saying\n\" Ashes to ashes.. \"\n\" [i][b]Dust[/b][/i] to [i][b]Dust[/b][/i] \" \nand then the boss dies.\nI said the word \"cringe\" a lot. I simply have no other way to describe it, because thats literally all it is. This game is just the absolute epitome of that term.\n\nThe combat in the game is honestly more atrocious than the story and characters. With your weapon you're just mindlessly spamming the same small selection of moves against hordes (and i really mean, HORDES) of braindead dumb damage sponge enemies that can hardly attack you effectively, but that get stunlocked by almost anything. Except theres 9999 of them, which would get kind of annoying in the highest difficulty, because i would get hit once every several hundred enemies killed, and that single hit would probably take a huge chunk of my hp or one shot me instantly, so i just lose more progress and have to do the chore even more. Which gets even more annoying when you die to something with no wind-up from off-screen. It gets even worse when some enemies that do nothing except slow everything down and force you to take it slow, instead of ending the chore faster, are introduced. The movement is genuinely floaty and imprecise as balls, sometimes geometry launches you into orbit with the flight move. \nAnd then you have the fidget attacks, which are a substantial portion of the relevant unlocks in the game. They're basically just a few different flavors of braindead, effortless, spammable AoE nukes that will hit the entire screen. You can either have it alongside your sword as another tool to slowly chip away at extreme damage sponge enemies, or you can invest it all into fidget so you spend the entire game nuking and stunlocking almost all the enemies (except this time at an actually decent pace) by doing nothing except pressing two buttons.\n\nPeople told me this game had cool metroid-elements and it advertises itself as a metroidvania. But all separate regions are completely unconnected from eachother and are all accessed via fast-travel. The metroid-style powerups do nothing except to create an arbitrary obstacle between the player and some (often garbage) treasure that will require backtracking after.\n\nI genuinely have no idea why this game has a gear and level up system. Its all the exact same gear with better numbers, its just completely superfluous and adds nothing except maybe making you grind for the highest difficulty. There really wasnt a need to come up with 90000 different kinds of materials and gear that change nothing except numbers\n\nsummed up :\n- the characters are mentally painful to look at and listen\n- the story is mentally painful to think of in retrospect, let alone actually witness\n- the combat is mind numbingly boring, until you get one-shot by a single hit and then it turns into an aneurysm\n- the highest difficulty somehow manages to be 0% challenge 100% chore. I am not even exagerating\n- all the elements like metroid-styled unlocks, gear stats, etc feel completely half assed, insignificant at best, and a complete detriment at worst.\nDont get me wrong, its somewhat impressive that a single dude made almost every single thing in this game, thats admirable effort. But just because it takes a lot of effort, that doesnt mean it cant be bad. The only pro i see in this game are the hand drawn visuals and graphics, which clearly took a lot of work for a one-man-job, and i admire that... but i still think it mostly looks dull.\n\nThis is one of the very few games that i straight up could not get myself to finish them. dropped it about halfway in so i dont know if it gets better after, but from what ive seen, think this might be the game with the lowest quality/effort ratio i have ever played in my life. I even feel like playing through the entirety of YIIK was (and is) more worth doing than enduring half, let alone the entirety of Dust: An Elysian Tail. In fact, if i ignore literal shovelware games, this is easily the worst game i have ever played\n\nI have absolutely zero idea of how this game is reviewed so positively. Im just going to assume that people want to fuck Fidget.", "timestamp_created": 1689876039, "timestamp_updated": 1689876688, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497834175825119019", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142475717": {"recommendationid": "142475717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011910006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1397242538}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful action platformer with solid gameplay and good story", "timestamp_created": 1689869957, "timestamp_updated": 1689869957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142244833": {"recommendationid": "142244833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200409353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1672271779}, "language": "english", "review": "seems fine", "timestamp_created": 1689565874, "timestamp_updated": 1689565874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142175809": {"recommendationid": "142175809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259262377", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1690563946}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the Best Games I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1689481215, "timestamp_updated": 1689481215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141953546": {"recommendationid": "141953546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132934914", "num_games_owned": 1083, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1666462614}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Soy and Reddit", "timestamp_created": 1689212053, "timestamp_updated": 1689212053, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407507151365280151", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141876528": {"recommendationid": "141876528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088824658", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1467508202}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm sure it's good but I could not get past the orange flying thing it annoyed me too much", "timestamp_created": 1689129677, "timestamp_updated": 1689129677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141814418": {"recommendationid": "141814418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010765255", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1033, "last_played": 1697183697}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm over a decade late to the party but OHHHHHHHH MY GOD WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE'S STILL NOT A SEQUEL YET.

And I mean UPWARDS, like a rocket to the top of the screen where no enemies are.\nFrom then on you just gotta wait until you fall again to get back into the fight.

I played on the highest difficulty for about 30% of the game. I had to lower it to the second hardest difficulty setting unfortunately, since the developers idea of high difficulty is to get Oneshot by literally everything. One small monsters attack? Dead. One flamethrower hit?

While still insanely impressive now, in comparison to some other games in the genre, it is not really exceptional I think.\n\nGameplay has a moderate amount of depth, kinda reminds me of the \"vagrant\" game I played a bit before this. Combo potential is pretty similair, but the minion abilities and comboing them adds that extra flair and special sauce, that is recognizably Dust. With spin move allowing some pretty creative puzzle, and a surprisingly free-flow movement. There is quite a bit of potential, and you can squeeze really long combos (as evident by 1000 combo achievement), but it kind of boiled down to rotation of several buttons, light attack, timed light into parry, directional dodge to get out of the center of the horde, aerial spins to build up combo fast, magic+spin to have some additional chain hits while using the bar (which fills by using light attacks). If you wanted to be extra fancy, you could also do the slide attack, light to heavy grab, aerial light to heavy grab, or quick light+heavy for launcher. Took a while to list the moves, but the biggest factor is chaining normal melee with spins (if you want high combo), otherwise normal melee for major damage.\nThe world isn't exactly interconnected, it's a set of open levels, that have story missions in them for a specific chapter, while you can revisit them freely for sidequests and puzzle secrets. The secrets are pretty damn fun to figure out, and sometimes a highlight of my gameplay. It's a good time, above average quality for sure.\n\nThe visuals are amazing in terms of smooth animations and nice use of vfx, especially with it being 10 years old now and once again - made solo. The furry faces of most characters are pretty damn generic, which ended up almost uncanny compared to other visuals. Some of the backgrounds were pretty nice too.\n\nThe sounds are good, if sometimes a bit imbalanced in volume, some effects are slightly repetitive after over 10 hours of playtime. Music is decent and works nice with the fairy tale aesthetic of the game, though I know that part was done by other people. The amount of voice acting surprised me, but the direction of VAs never struck me. Dust for example has the same tone over the 99% of game's runtime, sounding confused even by the end, a lot of minor characters were one note and cartoony, reminding me of some really low budget cartoons made in early 2000s.\n\nThe story can take you a bit by surprise, I was expecting something generic all the way, but the twist near the start felt like a neat shocker. The only shame being how predictably it plays out after that initial reveal. There is another twist with the protagonist's backstory, but that felt a little hollow, and borderline \"OC do not steal\", part darkness, part light, with inner conflict despite the goal of saving the world and uniting nations. I guess how unoriginal it ends up is a somewhat of a \"twist\" too, but not a satisfying one for me.\n\nI bet you can get it pretty cheap, considering how old it is by now, and you should have a decent time with it for quite a few hours, even if the story stops doing it for you, gameplay is solid enough for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1682734116, "timestamp_updated": 1682734116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137454389": {"recommendationid": "137454389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198952122509", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1682728794}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice Game", "timestamp_created": 1682732297, "timestamp_updated": 1682732297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137451826": {"recommendationid": "137451826", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124664610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 606, "last_played": 1682743597}, "language": "english", "review": "I was skeptical at first, the art looks too childish and the game is old.

Even as an achievement hunter, I can see why this game is still well liked. \nHOWEVER, while I did not hate this game with ever fiber of my being, I cannot say that I enjoyed it. \n\nSo I guess this is more of a neutral review? Let me explain. \n\nPros:\n-The art is actually stunning. I originally had a problem with the simplicity of the characters versus the backgrounds and other aspects, but I realized that that was maybe too critical. The backgrounds and general art though are beautiful, actually pleasing to my eyes. \n-Soundtrack is pretty nice. \n-Combat system: This will also show up on the cons list but I say the combat system is a pro because it is a good beat'em up combat system, but it's so ridiculously repetitive that it hurts (more on that later)\n-Improper leveling: So, this may honestly be on me and I'm not afraid to admit it. I tend to start games on the hardest difficulty possible (usually because there's an achievement tied to playing games on the hardest difficulty), and that may be the cause of this. BUT, I feel like the last two stages of the game are ridiculously hard for no reason. I never needed health items until I got to the snow area. This game also did the same thing that Mass Effect 1 did and made the final boss \"hard\" by just giving him a ****-ton of health and that bothers me to no end. Making the final boss difficult is great, but More Health does not equal more difficult. It just makes the fight boring, like, mind numbingly boring. I had more trouble from the minions leading up to him than the final boss himself and that just doesn't sit well with me. \n\nCons: \n-Generally boring. This game is beautiful art/sound wise, but man does the story and world building need work. The underground is about the only part of the game that was even remotely interesting world-building wise. That was the only place where I found myself wanting to explore, but that's only 1/4th of the game. The story and the characters? They have the bare minimum required and that's it. They all feel shallow to me, which is honestly depressing because I feel like there's so much more to pick at. It's like we got to the edge of the top of the mountain and stopped climbing before ever actually reaching the top. The characters have so much more to explore and it's just not there. They give you what you need to know for the main story and that's it. Which, if I'm honest, doesn't really make me fall in love with any of them. The characters also don't have much personality if I'm honest. I feel like the one with the most personality is Fidget, who is also probably my favorite character for that reason. However, even with fidget, I want to know more about where she comes from and why exactly she's been tasked with guarding this sword and why the sword is even in her clan's possession. \nThe main story-line is also incredibly predictable and even if it wasn't, they tell you the plot twist before it even happens. There is such a thing as too much fore-shadowing and this game is a perfect example of it. So, about 3/4ths of the way through I didn't feel a need to play any further because I already knew what was going to happen. the last 1/4th of the games was even more boring than the rest. \n-Combat system: It's good but man is it DRY. By the time you get to late game there's essentially one attack you're using specifically with the occasional Parry and that's it. I love a good beat'em up game, I love watching those combo numbers go up, bu not when I have to do the exact same move on repeat to do so. This is especially true with the final boss where you literally have to do the same move just to survive throughout his ridiculous amount of health. (Or that's how it felt to me anyways)\n-Voice acting is super cringe and also goes back to the same thing I said about the characters feeling like they have a lack of personality. It just doesn't really feel alive to me with the exception of Fidget. \n\nA lot of this might be preference, or It happened to me on the account of the difficulty I had it set to. That being said, I can not recommend this game to anyone who is story-driven like myself. If it weren't for the fact that I'm an achievement hunter, I don't know that I would've sat through all of that for as long as it did for me to finish it. Even now I'm dreading having to open this game back up to finish getting the achievements, because I already know I'm uninterested and that it's going to be incredibly boring. \n\nIf you get it on sale, go ahead and try it if you really feel a need, but otherwise, I don't recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1680417023, "timestamp_updated": 1680487313, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579843997955322266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135933221": {"recommendationid": "135933221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060025350", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1040, "last_played": 1393100015}, "language": "english", "review": "Great gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1680413565, "timestamp_updated": 1680413565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135926290": {"recommendationid": "135926290", "author": {"steamid": "76561199383006679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1680404225}, "language": "english", "review": "Very repetitive, Bosses weren't very difficult.

Clearly, there was a ton of passion and dedication put into this game, from the variety of gorgeous locations to the intricately-constructed item economy; if there is anything one can say in favor of Dust:AET, it is the artistry with which is was made. Sadly, this does not extend to the [i]effort[/i] put into it, or at the very least, that effort was not channeled into the correct places. Specifically, the pitfalls occur in the world design, story, and combat.[*][b][i]The world design[/i][/b] is seriously lacking. Each screen is immaculate and efficiently instructs the player in where the game expects you to go, but how they are strung together is the problem. Reread that last sentence; there\u00efn lies the problem: that the game [i]expects you to go in a certain direction[/i]. In transitional screens, this is fine, even perhaps a good thing, but every screen of the game, from beginning to end, behaves this way, and that it emblematic of the core failing of this game: it is not a metroidvania. Speaking personally, I picked up this game because it was billed to me as a metroidvania, and the whole time, I kept waiting for the game to \"open up\" (become less line\u00e4r), only for that time never to arrive. Even the different are\u00e4s are segmented into separate locations on a map screen, completely eliminating possibilities for traversal. Some connections sans map persist to the final product, but they are few in number. Some ares are nonlinear in structure, but most are not. What few paths one encounters that are initially untraversable lead at best to a chest or one or more keys to use on such chests. At the same time, the game can't be called definitively a sidescrolling beat-em-up, since there are so many branching pathways and permanent mobility upgrades; there is mandatory backtracking at certain points, but [i]locating[/i] that backtracking is almost always trivial. As a beat-em-up, it has an annoying amount of backtracking. As a metroidvania, it lacks substantial rewards for exploration. The characters from other games that one finds locked in cages offer almost nothing in terms of mobility/combat and absolutely nothing story-wise. All this is not even to call attention to the fact one needs to use clearly-glitchy exploits or take advantage of invincibility frames to traverse certain areas, both of which one will likely encounter in the \"mansions\" are\u00e4 (which, as a sidenote, is where I spent most of my time in the game; it's seemingly designed to frustrate you as a player, featuring invincible flying enemy-generators in a game where you can't go to the next screen if there are enemies nearby, platforming which only becomes possible with exploits, and more). [b][i]The world design needed more effort.[/i][/b][*][b][i]The story[/i][/b] is, in concept, very good. In print, even, the execution of the story is kinda good, but there are simply too many angles that don't go explored. Even the sidequests (which are by and large well-implemented) generally contribute fairly little to the broader story. Given the fact the central mystery centers around events that occurred in the recent past, this should have been, at the very least, possible. Perhaps one could hide such sidequests (the activity or the issuer) in the hard-to-access reaches of the map, instead of random chest, keys, or videogame characters. This was even implemented in one instance, but the sidequest in question had such dizzyingly little connection to the story that it broke my immersion. I'm just spitballing, but perhaps a regretful member of the enemy faction decided to hide out in a remote are\u00e4 due to fear of reprisal from their former superiors or victims? However, all this is not even to acknowledge the obvious: the voice acting is terrible. Every character sounds believably themself, but their inflections are so often...[i]ali\u00ebn[/i], as though every line was recorded separately with no indication as to the context it would occur in. I am thankful for my ability to play without listening to it. [b][i]The story needed more effort.[/i][/b][*][b][i]The combat[/i][/b] is something I can't rightly call bad, but only because I doubt I would have enjoyed the game had it been more complex. For what it is, it's a good system, even if most of it is just pressing the attack button with specific timing or a specific amount. The \"dust attack\" (which was spoiled for me by looking at the controls, so I don't feel too bad mentioning it) is incredibly versatile, and by the end of the game, I found myself using it much more than before. The chief problem with the combat is, rather, the enemies. The first boss is incredibly demanding, requiring repeated perfect timing to parry a very fuzzily-timed move, while bosses instantly become laughable afterwards, none but the final boss even coming close to the difficulty of the first. Inversely, while the rank-and-file enemies are trivially easy for most of the game, the last 2 chapters contain absolutely absurd difficulty spikes in even defeating the most low-level enemies in the are\u00e4. I never needed healing items until I got to the snow are\u00e4, after which I consumed them so fast I had to grind money to buy healing items. [b][i]The combat balancing needed more effort.[/i][/b][/list]If there's ever a rerelease of this game with fixing these things, I'll recommend it. At the moment... stay away.

While there are certainly games of this genre that I enjoyed more at an objective level (Hollow Knight and Ori), I couldn't really put Dust down until I beat it.As all proper metroidvanias should be, Dust is fun to explore and scatters its secrets throughout. It flows well and I never found myself lost.I do have some criticisms that prevent me from giving it too high of a score though. Disclaimer: I feel like this game was made for children, and most of the criticisms I'm about to bring up here can be explained away due to that. As a result, don't take these too seriously as negatives, as they can just as easily be positives with the right perspective.First, it's story is pretty basic. It strings you along with a grand mystery that is then revealed and then the final encounter happens. Nothing revolutionary but the characters and plot weren't bad.Second, the game's balance is weird. Levelling and gear increase power at a near exponential rate, meaning old areas will be really easy, but being underlevelled is severely punished through 2 hit kos and taking ages to kill things. Again, this is likely intentional as it means that kids can overlevel any area they are struggling with. This seems to be true for every difficulty level. The combat gets repetitive as well, but the game isn't super long so it didn't matter to me that much.The only \"real\" flaw I see with the game is its parrying. Parrying isn't something you have to worry about for the most part, but there are a few larger mobs that you can only kill via parrying. It's weirdly inconsistent and I found myself getting annoyed at it. Maybe it's just a skill issue on my part though.7/10 do play if you like metroidvanias.", "timestamp_created": 1679709480, "timestamp_updated": 1679709480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135260123": {"recommendationid": "135260123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983343880", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1168, "last_played": 1627946625}, "language": "english", "review": "storm", "timestamp_created": 1679603948, "timestamp_updated": 1679603948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135215674": {"recommendationid": "135215674", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996887747", "num_games_owned": 476, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1447736700}, "language": "english", "review": "I guess it's pretty cool that Deviant Art managed to create a game", "timestamp_created": 1679558411, "timestamp_updated": 1679558411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484886646270751953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135172731": {"recommendationid": "135172731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020264972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1387954907}, "language": "english", "review": "mediocre furry game", "timestamp_created": 1679507250, "timestamp_updated": 1682892563, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.414862900972366333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135166889": {"recommendationid": "135166889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192201125", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1679501167}, "language": "english", "review": "as a child i didnt know what furries were\n\nrevisiting this 10 years later, my childhood has been ruined \n\ngameplay still good tho", "timestamp_created": 1679501303, "timestamp_updated": 1679501303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496041297912597656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135123400": {"recommendationid": "135123400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087004064", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1686608493}, "language": "english", "review": "Wanted to leave this review because I nearly beat it the first time and it was fun, still fun not sure if I'll get back to it due to some reason that I want to play on my Steam Deck and it won't let me.

I played this years ago on PS4 and I felt a but nostalgic to try it again. Well I can say that those rose tinted glasses didn't really have to work hard because the game is still great!  The game tells a story of an amnesiac warrior that is entrusted with a legendary blade. Said blade happens to have a tiny creature as a guardian named Fidget and she is arguably the best part of the game to me. The main character Dust has pretty good back and forths with her keeping him grounded in the moment. She kept the conversations light and occasionally got a pretty good laugh out of me. The overall story is a bit light but still good for what it is giving you around a 10 ish hour campaign. There are a few side missions but most of them are usually on the way to what your already doing so it's more of a way to get resources more often then not. The combat has a pretty good flow to it where you actually get an xp bonus for higher combo counts making you really not want to get hit and abuse high juggling ranged attacks from Fidget. For level ups you get to choose what stats get bumped up and for the most part attack and Fidget are the 2 most important stats followed by defense and then health. That's what I used and on the second highest difficulty I made it through with little to no worries, just make sure to save often. The maps are pretty open and there's a pretty good variety of styles between the different areas so I never got bored going into new areas every few hours. I'm glad that this game is as good as I remember and I'll definitely come back to it again.

Not to mention many of the characters have their unique personality that makes this game enjoyable.\n[hr][/hr]\nTL;DR: this game is worth it, especially if you're into playing rich lore games that leave a mark in your memory forever.", "timestamp_created": 1667353196, "timestamp_updated": 1667353196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124561275": {"recommendationid": "124561275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079791493", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1980, "last_played": 1466045184}, "language": "english", "review": "Great gameplay and a good story to boot.

There are other parts of the game that aren't nearly as polished as others. It's still fun, no doubt, but if you have a hyper-critical eye- im sure you'll see areas in which the game feels undercooked.\n\nLike the RPG elements, as an example. You can powerscale yourself so fast that you're taking down most enemies with 1 hit. Your ability to make things excessively easier for you come down to how you allocate stat-points that, should of locked the player off a lot more than it did.\n\nThe story isn't much to look at, comes off as silly sometimes. \nDust loses his fckin' mind over a little rock guy's dad, [spoiler] who you never see onscreen till he's dead[/spoiler]\nBut you know, plenty of stories ask you to care a lot more about a character you've never met.\n\nHonestly the games development story is more interesting, and you kind of appreciate the game more knowing it was one guy doing all of the work.\nThis game came out when Xbox had an inde arcade marketplace, and it shows that it was running off Xbox money. Gleaming from what i know about the development about Psychonauts, you met microsoft's deadlines, or they didn't publish you.\nSo the fact that Dodrill, the developer of dust, was in with their XBLA releases, leads me that the crunch he put in was not self-imposed. Which explains why some of the game's areas feel undercooked- the dev slammed ass in 2011-2012 to meet a microsoft-imposed deadline.\nWhich, again, shows in its gameplay- but not so much that its annoying or frustrating. \n\nI suppose my recommendation comes with a asterisk.\nThis game brought me back to a time when Braid, Fez, and Meatboy (games that are referenced as secrets for you to find, with their own stat buffs) were THE inde games. It reminds me of the times where the hot new inde games were the talk of the schoolyard, so to speak.

Environments that you visit are dull and uninteresting, as well as the music paired along with it. Navigating these environments was also pretty boring no real challenge or interconnected-ness.

Sword fighting is youre main cause of damage combined with a small number of magical attacks. There is ground combat but youre jump is very high and you can fly a tiny bit for air combos. The story has some twists and turns you will not expect and might be one of the better stories for a metroidvania. You have a magical sidekick named fidget wich is a \" little\" sarcastic and a \"little\" pessimistic but is a great aspect of the story!

But a combination of stunning art, compelling gameplay, strong music and excellent controls make this the closest I can think of to baby's first Metroidvania.\n\nThe story's pretty simple, which isn't a bad thing. You're Dust, an amnesiac swordsman chosen to defeat an evil force terrorizing the land. The game's anthropromorphic cast, which ranges from cute to uncanny to downright disturbing, is enjoyable to watch and there's a neat twist to the story that I won't spoil. The writing's also surprisingly solid, with some very good jokes sprinkled in. The banter between Dust and Fidget is the highlight. The biggest thing to note about this game isn't the story, but how the story's told. Everything in this game was hand-animated by one person. Everything. From the cutscenes to all gameplay animations and background elements, it's hand animated. HAND ANIMATED! On top of that, the combination of Eastern and Western artistic elements turn the game into a unique hybrid being without an easy analogue.\n\nThe gameplay's also surprisingly solid. The game's primarily a metroidvania, with a combination of exploration through segmented 2D environments and new abilities being unlocked to allow for previously-inaccessible zones to be explored. The combat, while basic hack and slash in nature, has some interesting nuances with the inclusion of AOE abilities, juggling that can even be incorporated into navigation, and combo counts which increase experience. Yes, this is also something of an RPG, with leveling and equipment and stats and sidequests. There are also six challenge zones which test your dexterity and speed, but some of these can border on the unfair and I've only completed four with the top score (one was a pure fluke). I think I wouldn't have enjoyed the game as much as I did were it not for the modern and fluid controls. It makes playing the game an actual joy, not the plodding appearence that put me off most Metroidvanias.\n\nOn the sound front, all is well. The voice acting is more than servicable, adding real life and energy to Dust and Fidget especially.  The sound effects are also sound, if generic in places, and fit the odd mixture of Eastern and Western in this game. The music, co-composed by Alexander Brandon of Deus Ex fame and music group HyperDuck SoundWorks, is atmospheric and enjoyable, with a few standout tracks such as \"Aurora\" and \"The Blackmoor Mountains\".\n\nThis game is an absolute steal even at its standard price. Please support this incredible creator. We need more games like this, combining slick controls and a fascinating bled of genres with stunning art and enjoyable music. It's also technically a very sound PC port, with no framerate drops, crashes or glitches. The only minor critiques I have are its simple story, some fiddly elements within its navigation, and the sometimes-unfair challenge rooms. I don't say or feel this often. This is an absolute must buy.\n\n9.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1664740772, "timestamp_updated": 1664740772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

The Movement feels fluid, the combat system is simple, but it has this nice sort of rhythm to it, which makes for some fun gameplay, the level design is very well thought out, teaching the player about their new movement abilities until the point of mastery, there's a certain charm to the dialogue, the characters are unique in their own ways, the scenery makes each area you explore different in their own way, evoking different emotions on the player. \n\nThe Negatives: The Story itself is kind of bland, it hints at things that might make it more interesting, but thee's never really any payout. The lack of a proper fast travel system makes the gameplay repetitive if you are looking for a completionist run. This is made worse by the fact that there aren't really any major shortcuts that you can discover through your progress. This made worse by the fact that the map is not very useful as each block represents a very large area, this in itself wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that you can't label it for posterity. The parry system feels inconsistent, but the payout is too good not to try it, not to mention that it's almost necessary for certain enemies. On the other hand, the bosses were a complete joke, and had very little difficulty with them despite the fact thta I was playing on the second hardest difficulty. Finally, despite how much I liked the dialogue, it has far too much of it for my personal taste.\n\nAll things considered, I think it's a pretty solid MV with fun gameplay, but with some questionable design choices.\n\nFinal Rating: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1664031576, "timestamp_updated": 1664031576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590651988983154297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122637647": {"recommendationid": "122637647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198848114788", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 681, "last_played": 1663864450}, "language": "english", "review": "Most overrated game.

Game crashes on map screen if you hold a direction while entering it, Xbox Series X controllers seemingly don't work, and the game is way to easy to accidentally close if you spam escape, all issues I feel like a studio published by Microsoft should know to fix by now.\n\nOn the contrary, this game's story does a delightful job [spoiler]luring you into a false sense of security with \"rawr XD\" era humor and starting out with all of the iconic \"chosen one\" Mary Sue tropes, then thrusting you into a world where Dust has an apparently-detestable upbringing and our heroes are never guaranteed to do the right thing in time. Bad stuff happens in this game, and you just sort of have to accept it. It's a nice twist on what looks to be another happy-go-lucky furry-made product.[/spoiler]\n\nIt goes without saying that this game is obviously trying to appeal to furries at the time of its release, with a noticeably \"2010 DeviantART\" artstyle, Fidget being a goofy *X3 nuzzles* cookie-munching bat creature who I refuse to comment on further, and tons of faux-Japanese tropes that play into the anime uprising of that era. It sounds cringy in a modern light, and just once in a while Fidget will say something along the lines of \"evil x of dooooooom!\" that makes me want to tear out my ears, but for anyone who frequented the internet space at the time, especially as a young teen, it will definitely come off as somewhat nostalgic to experience a product of that era you might have missed.\n\nThere's obvious comparisons to other Metroidvanias like Hollow Knight and Blasphemous, both games which share similar elements with this game's combat, but admittedly this game stands on its own as one of the more unique games I've played. Melee is strong, magic is weak, and your \"combo\" attack can multiply the magic effects to make them viable in combat. It sounds annoying to do, but experimenting with all of the different spells you unlock is pretty fun. This also long-predates the rapid influx of Metroidvanias using the Dark Souls flasks, which is a huge breath of fresh air for me as somebody who plays a lot of these kinds of games and is growing sick of dropping my fucking healing item because I got slapped in the face while using it.\n\nWhile some of the digital drawings in this game might have aged a bit (they 100% look like the kind furries were drawing a decade ago, with hard fade-to-black shadows and a hard-on for the blur tool), I actually find myself enjoying a lot of it. The environments are appealing, some of the character designs are great, and the combination of 2D art and a 3D model on the sword just looks cool. \n\nThere's a lot here that a lot of people are going to have to put aside and overcome to enjoy this, especially if they're put off by furries, but I won't act all high-and-mighty and pretend this isn't just a solid game. Buggy, but solid.

I've completed the game on Hardcore and... it's pretty damn rough if you don't know what you're doing, plus Hardcore isn't necessary for completion.\n\nOther than that, the game is rather simple in its combat, and it has a bit of that dated quality, but that's what gives it charm. There's no over-acting, no memorizing 17 different control schemes; you just get in and play, and enjoy the story. The characters themselves have some pretty nice chemistry, too, which develops as time goes.\n\nAnd that last part is what frustrates me about some of the negative reviews. They won't get very far, then complain about the dialogue?

In his videos, he makes a few jokes and references to this game here and there. So eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to try it for myself. And let me just say, the fact that this game was developed in most part by just one person is honestly astounding. This game does so many things that are impressive on all fronts. The story is amazing (serious tone with plenty of fitting themes such as loss and redemption, but it also knows when to be light-hearted and humorous), the characters are loveable and memorable with lots of great interactions and dialogue (Dust and Fidget make a great protagonist duo, technically trio if you count Ahrah), the environments are all visually breathtaking and fun to traverse and explore, the combat is fluid, responsive and fun to execute (simple and easy to learn, but tough and satisfying to master), and that soundtrack. Oh, that soundtrack. Hyperduck Soundworks and Alexander Brandon really killed it making the music for this game. Each and every single piece does a great job serving its purpose and is absolute ear candy to listen to (seriously, the second I first booted up the game, I just sat there in awe listening to that menu theme. To me, that was the first sign that I knew this game would be something special). \n\nMy only real issue with the game is the third area in the main story. For a Metroidvania-inspired title, backtracking is never really an issue in Dust since you can get through areas pretty quickly and have plenty of opportunities to return to the world map from save stations (provided you have the required item to do so) and revisit areas from other entrances for ease of access. But in the third area of the game, getting back to the main section after taking a branching path takes forever, and since said main section is placed right in the middle of the area, warping back to one of the entrances doesn't really shorten that travel time at all. This is especially annoying if you enjoy doing item cleanup when arriving late in the game and have to constantly wander through several long rooms just to pick up one item on one path, only to backtrack all the way to the main section and repeat the whole process on a completely different path. This may seem just like a completionist thing, but doing this is also required in order to beat the main story. And it's the only part of the game to branch out into such long paths with no shortcuts or ways to ease that travel. Personally, that's the only part of the game that kind of bogged down the experience. But that doesn't stop me from loving the game to bits regardless.\n\nAll in all, Dust: An Elysian Tail is a breathtaking, heartbreaking experience that stands the test of time thanks to its smooth and responsive controls and combat, memorable story and characters (huge props to the voice director and all actors involved, phenomenal job here), and incredible soundtrack and art design that rival that of most modern day triple-A studios. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Metroidvania-esque titles, sidescrolling hack-and-slashers, or story-driven games.

On normal the game doesn't offer much of a challenge, but you can always increase the difficulty. The parry mechanic feels underutilized as a result. A few enemies pretty much require it in order to defeat them, but it doesn't feel like it offers much to the normal playthrough experience. This may be different on higher difficulty playthroughs. At first I was annoyed that the leveling system forced you to keep your stats somewhat balanced, but it made sense when I got to a location where the only way to defeat specific enemies was to use the magic system. It makes sense not to put the player in a situation where they can't defeat an enemy at all or where it would take a large amount of time to defeat them. The standard enemies feel a little basic. They don't seem to attack very frequently, but they are fun to mow through.

And back in this long forgotten era, you got 2 free games every month when you had a gold membership. (No gamepass yet kids!) I was super excited to get a bunch of free games, and the very first one I got? It was Dust: An Elysian Tail. It was super difficult, and I didn't get very far, but always thought the main character's design was really cool. I gave up around half way in, but watching my sister play it was a lot of fun. And then, 8 years later, I noticed it was on steam and picked it up.\n\nDust is really easy. This is baby's first metroidvania through and through. Don't let that be a deterrent though, this game is still really good. Just moving through the levels is really fun, with all of the movement options they give you. The progression feels really nice, and while the difficulty never really changes, its pretty easy throughout, getting new moves and watching your damage numbers get higher is always a joy. \n\nOutside of gameplay, the game looks really pretty. Dust is really well animated, as are the effects on all of his moves, making it a spectacle every time you get into a fight. The environments are all gorgeous, and all feel distinct, making it really easy to remember where everything is for backtracking. The enemy designs don't stand out very often, but when you're destroying them in mass, they don't really need to stand out as individuals. The story is interesting enough, and while the writing can be really corny sometimes, its still really charming, and the dynamic the main trio has is really enjoyable.\n\nOverall, it was really cool revisiting a nostalgic game, and while I was kinda disappointed how easy it was, I really enjoyed my time with Dust. If you want to get into metroidvanias but are intimidated by the big guys, this is absolutely worth giving a shot. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1657481590, "timestamp_updated": 1657481590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746359169483184814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118465848": {"recommendationid": "118465848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069877806", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 238, "playtime_forever": 1373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1373, "last_played": 1657305035}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh what a wonderful adventure it was.

Hand painted. Ambience and characters alike. Items and everything feel alive and there is a special shine to it.\n\n[h1] Sound [/h1]\n\nThe music fits the ambience, it's a sort of exploration and action osts, so it fits the genre. There is enough variation to not get the player bored. The soundtracks are on par and responsive to the player's actions.\n\nAll lines are voice acted and are good which gives a plus.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nWhile the game gives you a lot of freedom, controls are very responsible and you will learn more moves skillsets, you will end up doing the same combos and things, because there is barely any need to do fancy stuff. At maximum you will need to hold the button to counter very few enemies but that's it. In other words, it's very repeteable. If you love hack & slash games you will not mind it too much. And some enemy designs are very annoying, like you have to keep doing the same specific thing a lot to kill them (it doesn't feel like a challenge, but a chore), specially because they keep ressurrecting indefinitely. The final boss battle repeats the same annoyance I said before, but since it's the final one, it's passable.\n\nThe shops do the basic function of selling things, but they aren't what I would expect of a shop. You would expect new things on shop, like a rare new thing, a certain ingredient, but they sell all the same items, and they resell what you sold. You will be crafting your own gear a lot more. You also cannot sell blueprints for some reason. Think of a shop as a supply of health items/materials. Which kinda is not needed that much because...\n\nThe game is EASY. I played on TOUGH because a lot of people were saying there was barely any challenge. And on TOUGH, you can die easily, so I'd say TOUGH is the way to go, you at least need to mind your actions a little more.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nStory is allright. It's the cliche of a guy who wakes up and don't remember anything and is in a conflict between evil and good to find about himself. You get barely any choices though. There is one certain quest where you can choose what happens but it's minor. The ending is also... nothing unexpected.\n\nCharacters/NPC personalities are very good and distinct. You will feel as they are very different from each other. It's not those games where all of them are generic and you don't care at all.\n\n[h1] Bugs / Troubleshooting [/h1]\n\nThis game is quite old, but it ran smoothly to me.\n\nI didn't notice any bugs, although, you CAN keep attacking to reach higher places that you shouldn't yet.

Far from without flaw, but a fantastic experience that anyone with eyes and ears should at least consider. \n\nIt goes without saying that this game is gorgeous; I don't think anyone in their right mind is arguing otherwise. The artstyle, while obviously being a bit 2010 furaffinity-ish, is extremely well executed. Not to mention the game has 2D animated cutscenes?? That's rare in games to begin with, let alone independently developed ones. While they can be a bit stiff and are quite low-framerate, you have to commend the effort put in to have such spectacle. \n\nThe in-game animation doesn't disappoint either; all of Dust's animations are animated by hand, with his sword, Arah, being pre-rendered 3D animation. That said, Arah doesn't stick out very much, and the animations as a whole look very natural. Background characters and enemies are obviously animated on a 2D skeleton rig to save some time, but they also don't tend to stick out too much. Plus, you're gonna be focused on Dust himself most of the time, anyway. \n\nI've seen people complain about the voice acting, especially Dust for sounding like too much of an edgelord. While I can see where this comes from, it's never bothered me. The voice acting sounds very natural to me, the amateurish nature of it frankly only adds to the game, and Dust has more than enough character in not just his performance but also in his writing that I don't see the problem. Fidget I could imagine getting on people's nerves since she's quite high-pitch and can get loud, but these scenes are rare and usually just for comedic effect (e.g. \"No, no! Mash the buttons! DO SOMETHING!!\"). Plus, Fidget is an adorable companion that I love having by my side at all times. I think she really only ever improves scenes she's in.\n\nSpeaking of, the game's story and writing. I love it. Every character is a joy to hear from, and none of them ever feel too one-dimensional. Even the villain, a cold-hearted genocidal army general, is given at least a hint of humanity, though never enough where it feels like you're supposed to sympathize with him. He's still obviously a terrible person. And without getting into spoilers, the ending, while a bit sudden in my opinion, is very well done. Well-animated, well-written, emotional, thematic...how can you go wrong? \n\nThe theming of the game is also one of its stronger points. Its themes mostly consist of the nature of power and sympathy, and how the two co-exist, with subthemes of inevitabilities. I'm no literary analyzer, so I'd recommend watching [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMzkCNpIO8Y]this video[/url] for a better literary analysis (spoilers though, be careful!), but in my personal opinion, I think the game executes exploring these themes fantastically, and they add another layer of enjoyment to what is already a fantastic experience. \n\nNow for the gameplay, and this is where the game sadly draws a lot of ire. In my opinion, while it's serviceable, it's nothing special. This is very much so a game you play for the story, with the gameplay being there to keep you entertained in the time between story events. If you came here for a gameplay-oriented experience without an emphasis on story, temper your expectations. That said, the gameplay is far from BAD, it's just fairly run-of-the-mill beat-'em-up stuff. Well executed, but especially with the game's world being so fantastic, it can be a bit disappointing if you don't know what you're in for. \n\nAnd for my final part we have technical issues. This game is fairly bug-free, and I've yet to experience a crash. However, sadly the game syncs graphical data to the cloud. This can be problematic if you have a second PC or, like me, have a Steam Deck, as not having the correct graphic settings results in a black screen until you delete the settings or navigate the menu - blindly - to change them. Not fun. Not fun at all. I hope this'll be fixed in the future, but I wouldn't hold my breath. The game is 10 years old after all, and basically all updates have ceased. That said the Linux port of the game is fantastic and basically the exact same as the Windows version, no problems on that front. The game even has cloud saves between OSs properly configured unlike SOME games *cough cough metro series cough cough postal 2*\n\nAll and all, play this game. The game isn't too expensive for what you get, and there's no shame in waiting for a sale if you think it is.

I love the drama as well as the sarcastic humor, and the gameplay is great (honestly the combat system is so much fun, I could hack and slash forever). There is a perfect balance between slice-of-life and plot-driven storytelling, with the pacing being particularly well done to me. The twists are so well done as well (foreshadowing and everything). I like that it gives you subtle and not-so-subtle hints, but it never fully clicks until the twists are revealed. It also has some bonus content for the player, as there are optional challenges to test your abilities (achievements, treasure collecting, difficulty levels, and battle arenas).

My best recommendation for the developer would be have more achievements: 100%, 116% (full 'completionist'), attain Lvl 60, 500 combo, etc. (variety of diff combo number achievements), and possibly a slightly extended/improved ending for beating with all Quests & Challenges completed.  I don't know if I'll ever play it again, as post full completion the game offers little, but I liked it more than I expected to.  Nice music, pleasant animation, and REALLY tight gameplay, again, kudos.

Dust: An Elysian Tail, firstly, is NOT a furry game I swear. Anthropomorphic animals doesn't always mean furries, please get lost if you're about to throw that stuff this way.\n\nThe combat is very good (very fast-paced too, but not in the bad way!); being an action-adventure experience, it certainly does the job well. It's not too easy, and it's also not extremely hard. The controls are easy to learn and so are the mechanics.\n\nThe voice acting is a 10/10, the person who played Dust you can tell really had fun doing the character, and while Fidget is kind of annoying, I think that's actually the point. None of that will prevent me from keeping that spare Fidget doll. [i]Forever.[/i] :)\n\nThe art design and environments of this game are astonishingly beautiful, the soundtrack is truly incredible and that alone already makes this such a masterpiece of a game. The artstyle works very well with the environment and the combat animations fit so well with the rest of the game.\n\nThe story is also something to behold, this is Dust putting the pieces of the puzzle of his past together, all concluded in a great altercation with the final boss, which I would prefer not to spoil. I'd highly recommend getting this game even just for the story alone!\n\nThe cutscenes are amazing, and especially near the end are absolutely incredible. I honestly have nothing but good things to say about this game, it really is that good.\n\nI rate it a 9/10, because if it were a 10/10, I would be lying as no game is perfect. But I think, this game is about as close as it gets if you're looking for a relatively short playtime-length in a game that is essentially as close as you can get to a masterpiece of a fully playable visual novel.\n\nOh yeah, and the 4th wall breaks are just hilarious.

I still enjoy this game as short as it is. I only wish the cut-scenes looked as good as the in game animations. but there are so few cut-scenes that it mattered very little in the long run. Now, I could be blinded by nostalgia. But, for a game with such a small team working on it, this is a very impressive game and I am very thankful for the opportunity to play it!

You get used to things that might be annoying at fitst (character design, voice acting) and it's not long enough for the imperfect stuff to become boring (combat, RPG elements). For me personally, audiovisuals, worldbuilding, story and character can definitely justify blander gameplay so if you feel the same, give it a try.\n\nFirst of all is the absolute best aspect of the game - art an music. Now the character design might be a little off-putting to some people (because furries) but there is no inappropriate stuff and I got used to it pretty quickly. But the world and especially the parallax background is so beautiful! I especially loved the peak of Archer Pass, where there is a giant LOTR-like statue in the background that slowly reveals itself and when you get to the top, an NPC tells you the story of the place... it took my breath. My other favourite areas were the caverns and the mounintains - the levels are just so beautiful.\n\nAnd man the music! Writing about it doesn't do it justice! I'm definitely going to listen to the soundtrack even now when I finished playing the game. But even though the songs are beautiful on their own, they work really well with the levels they play in. In connection with the visual style it draw me in so heavily, I can only compare it to playing Ori, no other 2D game got me so immersed in the world as these ones.\n\nThe combat is hack'n'slash that is not too technical. You get a few combos and techniques at your disposal but it's up to you how creatively you use them, you can basically just spam attack or Dust Storm with magic again and again. It gets repetitive but I wouldn't say boring. And some of the combos look really cool and make you feel cool if executed properly, even if you could win anyway without them. So it's more up to you to keep the combat fresh. I didn't get bored but I think if the game was any longer, I would.\n\nIt has some platforming which I really like and miss in some modern MVs even though it's not too technical either. Each level is pretty linear but is also filled with secrets so it makes sense to return once you get new abilites. What I really like is, that you can access some secrets even before you get the intended ability, by some clever play and using a technique you have from the start of the game! I won't say more but it's in a similar vein as nail pogo in HK to get over spikes.\n\nIt is an RPG, it has drops, gear and crafting but I kinda liked it. It's not too overwhelming and there aren't that many recipes. I think this is done much better than in Bloodstained: ROTN, where I was really overwhelmed by it. And can also buy most of the materials so you have a choice to either go grinding for the materials, or sell other stuff and buy them for a worse price.\n\nCharacters. At first, Dust seemed like an edgy OC with an UwU companion (which they kinda are) but after a few hours, they really grew on me. Even Fidget which annoyed me at first, had me laughing later in the game. And later in the game, I really started to love the voice acting, almost each character was voiced by a different person, they use different accents and in the cutscenes, they really put emotions in.\n\nThe story is nothing too special - you don't know who you are, you go on a mission to find out, basically saving the land on the way. But I quite liked the take on Dust's identity. I also like the world bulding. It doesn't have too heavy of a lore like or details but the small pieces are very interesting. Small bits of history, culture and visual details really add to the experience. Again, Archer's Pass was my favourite, I really felt like I was there.\n\nIt took me 24 hours to 117% with most achievements on Tough and I say it's the perfect length for a game like that.

The game is clearly dated just from the gameplay/combat but the story line is top notch and is undoubtedly the main reason why the game was so popular and remembered to this day.\n\nWhat's more remarkable is this game was designed by one man alone, going by the name of Dodrill, he was only aided for the soundtracks and voice acting. Well done to you Dodrill!\nTotal Score = 93/100.\n\nSIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:\nHollow Knight, Dead Cells, Ori and the Will of Wisps.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nDust takes place in a world populated by anthropomorphic creatures, where the main character, Dust, comes upon a sentient sword, the Blade of Ahrah, and its guardian Fidget. Without memories of his past, Dust follows Fidget's advice and aids the population of the world against forces led by General Gaius. The game is an action-adventure game with Metroidvania-style exploration, requiring the player to gain power-ups to allow Dust to reach new areas. Combat is based on brawler-like mechanics, where Dust can use a combination of swordplay and magic from Fidget to defeat enemies.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 9 / 10\nShocked that this hasn't been turned into a series/movie.", "timestamp_created": 1645545822, "timestamp_updated": 1645546615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768174409866333008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110688056": {"recommendationid": "110688056", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998455758", "num_games_owned": 1517, "num_reviews": 1959, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 276, "last_played": 1515422644}, "language": "english", "review": "Stylish platformer.

The story is well paced and went in a direction I wasn't really expecting, in a couple of places. The dialogue and character interactions, especially between Dust and Fidget, are good at keeping the tone relatively light-hearted even as the story gets darker. The visual art style of the world is consistently beautiful, and all the conversations are fully voiced, with unexpectedly good voice acting.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the fighting style provides enough variation to be interesting without being particularly complex to master. A variety of sidequests and challenges help flesh out the world while ensuring that there's enough to do without felling obstructed. While I never felt the need to deliberately try to farm experience or money, the game somehow manages the rare feat of making money matter even to the very end. I did encounter a few technical glitches, such as conversations refusing to advance if I tried to rush through them. (This matters more at higher difficulty settings, because every major boss has an extended dialogue immediately prior to the combat.)\n\nOverall, an extremely well-done and enjoyable experience. 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1645319131, "timestamp_updated": 1645319131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110568872": {"recommendationid": "110568872", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986527965", "num_games_owned": 724, "num_reviews": 401, "playtime_forever": 1271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1271, "last_played": 1430798440}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent enough action platformer.

Tras la reciente experiencia con el anterior metroidvania quer\u00eda probar algo parecido que aparentemente parece de mayor calidad y dispon\u00eda de muy buena calificaci\u00f3n por los usuarios de Steam, as\u00ed que me decid\u00ed a jugarlo por fin.\nLa verdad que este Dust me ha recordado m\u00e1s a un Ori que a un Castlevania o Metroid, salvando las distancias, desde luego. El juego a priori te entra por el ojo, en sus visuales y trailers parece muy bello con dise\u00f1os muy bonitos. Una vez que lo empiezas y llevas un rato jugando te das cuenta que el juego no es tan fino ni tan hermoso como de un primer vistazo, al menos para m\u00ed. Los dise\u00f1os de los personajes principales no est\u00e1n mal, pero tanto los secundarios como los de los enemigos dejan mucho que desear. Tiene problemas con resoluci\u00f3n de los sprites en los personajes cuando dialogan, lo cual echa un poco para atr\u00e1s. Por otro lado el juego cuenta con doblaje recurrente, algo poco com\u00fan en estos juegos, el cual est\u00e1 bastante bien, la verdad. A nivel jugable ha sido un puro machacar el bot\u00f3n de ataque. El juego cuenta con un par de combos, pero para nada necesarios. Los enemigos no tienen patrones, casi ni atacan. Y los jefes finales son pi\u00f1ata total, sin apenas dificultad, ni siquiera el jefe final. La historia es m\u00ednimamente interesante, sobre todo por el doblaje, que hace que le prestes atenci\u00f3n, pero nada del otro mundo.\nRealmente esperaba m\u00e1s de este juego con tan buena valoraci\u00f3n. Supongo que el paso del tiempo lo ha castigado y lo que ofrece me sabe a poco.

Here's the review I wrote for it after I finished playing it near the end of 2019\n\n\n\nI've known of the game \"Dust: An Elysian Tail\" for a long time, but it wasn't until a few months ago that I owned a computer that could reliably play it; my last one could but it sounded like my fans were getting ready for takeoff the whole time so I didn't want to risk it.  So, to sort of inaugurate this new computer, I started playing Dust a few months ago, following my usual habit of only playing so much a day to make it last as long as I could.  Until I beat it once through; then I played it all the time.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to decide that this was definitely a game I wanted to get as much satisfaction out of as possible.  I like action games and RPGs and I love Metroidvanias, so a combination of the two with some RPG elements was right up my alley...and yes, it helps that it's full of furries, in my case ^_^ (nothing wrong with knowing what pleases you, and when something appeals to that, so much the better...and even if that were not so, Fidget is <3).  About 49 hours of playtime later, I'm satisfied, and want to share my thoughts on the game and why I recommend it.\n\nI'll start with what might be the game's best feature: The presentation.  This game is PRETTY.  The screenshots from whatever store you buy it from don't lie, it's almost like playing a cartoon, a great-looking cartoon.  Even better than the visuals is the audio.  The soundtrack, while not especially large, is excellent and several songs have found their way to my iPod, and I generally add only a half dozen tunes a year to that at most.  There were a few points in the game where I just stopped for a little while and admired the area's ambiance.\n\nThe story is good too.  While the story's probably not what you're playing the game for, it tells a nice one with likeable characters.  In particular, as noted previously, Fidget is a precious little ball of attitude and fourth wall-breakery.\n\nBut, with this being an action RPG, the most important aspect of such a game is the gameplay, especially the combat.  And how is that?  It's fun and fairly easy to both learn and master.  You start the game with pretty much your entire moveset and have plenty of opportunity to experiment with it even in the first areas.  It's certainly cathartic to go hacking and slashing whether or not your enemies are much of a challenge, and even my third and last time through the game, I was still getting thrills out of it, mainly from playing on Hardcore.\n\nActually, speaking of \"fairly easy,\" that's a fitting segue into the main issue I had with the game, and that's that it's just that: \"Fairly easy.\"  Even my first time fighting them, the bosses were cake; for example, the one time I took damage during the final boss fight wasn't even from the boss.  Reloading a previous save rarely costs you much time or progress.  The presence of almost all secrets is clearly indicated by a symbol on the map or by paths you haven't yet taken, and while that's fairly standard for Metroidvania games (and, indeed, 2D Metroid games), the secrets themselves usually aren't hard to find.  You get the rewards for the challenge areas regardless of how well you did, and while some rewards are definitely better than others based on how soon you can access the challenge areas and how good your gear probably is by then, these areas easy to ace with some practice and patience...plus as far as I know you don't get any reward for acing all of them other than an achievement, which is fine with me, achievements make me feel accomplished.  Playing on Tough, especially if it's not your first time through, didn't feel much harder than Normal; it wasn't until I played on Hardcore that I even got a game over, and that's only because it's a lot easier to get one-shot and consequently not have a chance to heal.\n\nThat said, as with many action RPGs, the game is built to accommodate you if you want to challenge yourself and have a little discipline.  You don't [u]have to[/u] equip the best gear or use the best healing items (in fact, you don't have to equip or use either of those things at all) and you don't [u]have to[/u] level up any of your stats when you gain a level.  My last time through the game, I didn't get one of Fidget's power ups until I reached the point in the game where I absolutely had to, just to see if I could.  I'm just saying the default game made me feel overpowered at times, enough so that each time through I put limits on myself to keep it fun.\n\nThen there's the other issue that I heard a lot more about when I was looking up reviews for the game: The length.  This one wasn't so bad for me.  Everyone calls it short, and while getting total completion and every achievement (other than \"beat the game on Tough or Hardcore\") on my first playthrough only took me about 18 and a half hours...with a modest while of that time being cutscenes, waiting around to heal via item regeneration because I'm a healing item hoarder (you're NOT going to run out of healing items, I'm just one of those people), or just going and hacking up enemies for fun, loot and experience...they were satisfying hours.\n\nAs for bugs, there's only one that I ever encountered: Sometimes the minimap doesn't show found treasures as having been \"found\" until you bring up the full map.\n\nIf I were to compare it to one other game, it would definitely be Samurai Legend Musashi on the PS2.  Both are action-adventure RPGs, they have great visual styles, the soundtracks are awesome (I've had some Musashi tunes on my iPods for almost 15 years), the combat is not especially deep but it is still fun, they're generally not very hard, and not everyone has played them.  Dust has better voice acting (Musashi's wasn't bad, Dust's is just better), though, and more Metroidvania elements.  And, in both cases, they left me wanting MORE, though Dust still feels like it has more content than Musashi (definitely for your buck if we're going by a sale price of something like $50 for a PS2 game when they were new).\n\nIf I were to give Dust: An Elysian Tail an overall rating?  I'm going to go with...an 8.5 out of 10.  A gem of indie gaming.  There's nothing dusty about this gem.  Just be ready to challenge yourself, because the game kind of won't.\n\nIf you own it or are considering owning it, here are a few tips for newbies:\n* There's an item that makes getting a 1,000-hit combo a lot easier.\n* The combo countdown timer goes something like a second since you last hit an enemy, unless an enemy you hit is still in the air; you don't get extra hits for striking enemies that are out of health, but it will refill your energy meter and keep the combo timer from going down.\n* Make notes to yourself of places you can't go or treasures you can't get and why it looks like you can't.  It will make the \"Metroidvania\" part of backtracking a lot easier.\n* The aerial Dust Storm is godly.\n* There's one rather obscure secret that you're unlikely to find unless you know Dust's creator is a huge Castlevania fan.", "timestamp_created": 1642856627, "timestamp_updated": 1642856627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526197075843811035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108513162": {"recommendationid": "108513162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312838299", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 588, "last_played": 1628741221}, "language": "english", "review": "I have this game to blame for turning me into a furry.", "timestamp_created": 1642831683, "timestamp_updated": 1642831683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668375968933105469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108511301": {"recommendationid": "108511301", "author": {"steamid": "76561199103327225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1904, "last_played": 1668061658}, "language": "english", "review": "Y E E s.

It's a fun action platformer that's a bit on the short side, and even shorter without the plot, but it makes up for it.

I did like the Dust Storm attacks, although they're similarly limited. Basically, your little flying companion can throw ineffective projectiles that don't do much on their own, but if you use the special \"spin your sword like a propeller\" attack, it amplifies it a ton. Unfortunately, there's only three types that do more or less the same thing, save for different methods (homing projectile, pillar, chain attack) that don't make up for it. It's also best suited for distraction more than anything. Aerial dust storm gives you a ton of upward momentum if you're beneath enemies, which was fun to exploit.\n\nThe average enemy is a complete pushover, they never give you much trouble. They're only a problem when they can actively dodge, and that's easy enough to deal with. The bosses are meh, they're not outstanding. They all have a tiny moveset and aren't that imposing overall. The final boss has way too many phases, and kinda comes out of nowhere. It's also very silly to watch him run into position and kneel to wait for you to hit him once so he can go flying dramatically.\n\nI was surprised to see so many little secrets hidden around the world, and they were fun to hunt around for. They weren't amazingly hard to find (at least, everything I found wasn't), and they count towards total completion so you can exceed 100%, which was very satisfying, especially when you reach them when you're not supposed to by launching enemies and flinging yourself at them before you get the ability specifically to do all that on command.\n\nThis game is SO Xbox-ey. Like, the sound design is that chimey gem-like Xbox 360 sound, it's so good. Straight out of some puzzle game demo on the Arcade, or an early 10's mobile jewel game. It does have a bit of crust in the art style, though. The anime eyes on Western cartoon look didn't age too well, I don't think. While it did it decently well and avoided some clunkyness, the characters have that \"assembled\" look to them, like they have separate parts for their head, body, and limbs that just get rotated around instead of full animation (I'm not complaining!).\n\nIt is fully voice acted, which was a bit surprising when it easily could have had none, or a weird mix of the two where only main character speak in important cutscenes. Fidget has that cutesy squeaky slightly exaggerated voice that might get on some people's nerves really quick, but probably not as much as Dust. I always wanted to skip the protagonist's lines, right? I don't know how to describe it but it's everything about him, I just don't want to listen to him.\n\nVERY cheesy anime feel to it, a little too much for me, complete with that specific kind of protagonist voice acting that makes me want to skip everything he's saying, the sword that only talks to move the plot along, quests that don't develop anything since they conclude instantly for a character you'll never see again, very unconvincing internal struggle, two-dimensional \"villain\" that's just a character with a name to be the bad guy, rapidly escalating stakes from seemingly out of nowhere, et cetera etc you get it right?\n\nAs for story, it started out kinda boring, but eventually started taking things seriously, maybe a little too seriously, right? Like, that's cool, it's dramatic and profound but. This didn't come from anywhere substantial. At the very least, there weren't any super completely out-there twists, so at least I wasn't totally driven away.", "timestamp_created": 1642558098, "timestamp_updated": 1642558098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652965724468231201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108273875": {"recommendationid": "108273875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198853193694", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1252, "last_played": 1692314475}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hermoso.", "timestamp_created": 1642521755, "timestamp_updated": 1642521755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108265543": {"recommendationid": "108265543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210460549", "num_games_owned": 1023, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 2102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2102, "last_played": 1642508717}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]BlytzDragon Gaming Zone[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/BlytzDragon]Steam and Discord Group and Curator[/url]\n\n[b]Excellent Game[/b]\nMetroidvania mixed with stylish action and an anime art style.

The team that made Dust was extremely small, anywhere from one to five people small. So all negatives are understandable and are not held to the same level as those of a major company's. Okay, now, we start.\n\nDust's artstyle is...a thing. I get you can make bipedal animals and not be a furry but I mean...come on. However if even a guy who's not a big fan of furries like me can look past that to enjoy a genuinely pretty map and well made designs, anyone can. Often though the presentation can be a little hazy. It feels like the game' graphics are blending together and can often make hoard fights hard to work through. But that's rare and aside from when fire or lava is around, it's not bad and can be gotten used to.\n\nMusic for Dust is great. While nothing sticks out or is that memorable, it's all well done and super appealing. I don't listen to any of it on its own but it certainly is by no means bad. The music helps set the tone of all the areas really well and makes it fun to explore and get immersed.\n\nThe characters are hit, mostly miss. I simply could not get into many of the characters, but the two most important ones, Dust and Fidget, are so fun. Fidget gave me heavy Midna vibes and Dust himself is a perfect mix of an amnesiac edgelord and a goofster punk. And while Ahra, the sword, is also funny here and there and serves as a great straight man and mentor for the two kids, he kinda fell short for me compared to the other two. However compared to the other characters, Dust, Fidget, and Ahrah are Shakespeare. I get it, small team, small game (compared to other metroidvanias), writing can be hard to complete. Hell, I'm a writer and it's hard fitting just five to eight characters into a single book, much less dozens into a 10 or so hour game, so I get it. 'Sides, it's not that big of an issue for me in general. But what is is the quantity.\n\nOften Dust felt overbearing and borderline suffocating with how many characters and by extent sidequests they just throw onto you whenever you get into a new town. Made me simply suffer from overchoice and just not do any sidequests unless I stumbled upon it.\n\nThe world is beautiful and full of crap to do. Heck, when I stopped playing, I was nowhere near done. With time trials, combat trials, aforementioned side-quests, and just things to do. Really made it feel lived in and like, well, a world.\n\nThe story is serviceable. It's not bad, it's not good. It's there, and it helped carry the game to the end, which is what a story for a non-story focused game should do at the least. Now, that's not a bad thing, but I'm just not interested in the Moonblood wars or the world's story as a whole.\n\nThe bosses...look, I hate mincing words. They're bad. I did not like a single boss in this game, yes even contrary to what some YouTubers say, the final boss too was kinda poopy. Which is a shame that the bosses are, since well\n\nI've been mixed but leaning to negative more this review so far, this is when it gets positive and almost single-handedly why I recommend this game. The combat. The combat is simple, yet so SO fun. There's mainly three things you can do, swing your sword like a dingus, have fidget attack, or spin your sword. These all intertwine into this fun dance of combat that flows so well and never becomes tiring (except with the bosses). Heck even the status effects in this game aren't too bad, which is super rare! The game is sheer bliss when you can to fight enemies, with only ONE type being one I kind of dislike, but they stop showing up around chapter 2 or 3 so they're not too bad. The momentum the dust storm gives you especially when around enemies is astounding. Then you combine your dust storm with Fidget's attacks and it just becomes the epitome of controlled mayhem. I love this game's combat.\n\nThe voice acting ranges from existent to great. No bad work here. From Gaius' soft but intimidating voice, to damn Xander Mobus as the shopkeep, to Dust being able to both be empty inside, yet still have a hint of child-like glee at petty jokes or pranks. But the best is...Fidget??? Yeah for some reason the squeaky small animal companion cliche is actually my favorite voice work in the game.Sure, she IS squeaky, small, petty, but it's in an endearing way that reminds me of a mix of Vi from Bug Fables and Midna from Twilight Princess, and I love those two characters (With Vi being one of my favorites of all time) so I may be biased but I liked Fidget.\n\nI don't think I properly put into words how much the gameplay carries this game. Even if you ignored the story and just mucked around the world for twenty hours, put down the game, and never played it again, you'd still have had fun. Build crafting, combo practicing, hitless runs, no upgrade runs, time trials, there's a near endless skill ceiling for a damn metroidvania. Feels like a Devil May Cry game mixed with Hollow Knight and I love it. The combat single handedly sells this game, all the other positives are just icing on the cake and the negatives can easily be forgotten once enemies show up and you start seeing red.\n\n(TL;DR) Dust is a game that, while has a lot of flaws due to the small team size, they can be looked past for the legendary and never-tiring gameplay that alone makes the game worth your $15, immersive music, great main cast, and decent world exploration. I may replay this game again some day. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1638260628, "timestamp_updated": 1681806238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104697177": {"recommendationid": "104697177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268651056", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 473, "last_played": 1638187419}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been streaming this game on twitch, and damn is it enjoyable.

Or the use of the incredible magical skills, your small companion and friend Fidget, has to offer!\n\nAlthough short in playable content, it really shows the love and dedication that the Game's Producer/s have put in it.\n\nWorth a buy, even better if you can get it on sales!

While I'm not a fan personally of the story and found it at points to be very tedious and drawn out, it can easily be skipped. \n\nThe combat can be very fulfilling and exciting, especially when facing hoards of enemies at once and have to manage your magic, health, and stamina to try and achieve the longest chain possible. However, I did find that once you reached a certain level or even found a rare item drop that increases your attack power, killing enemies gets to be too easy, even on Tough mode. Bosses proved next to no challenge (I only needed 3 tries to get through the final boss at level 30ish), and going back to explore previous areas means defeating enemies is as easy as hitting them once, even enemies that are deemed mini bosses. \n\nThe game has Metroidvania-esque elements but I wouldn't really call it that as the game is fairly linear, even with various side quests sprinkled in. You can go back to find hidden treasures and keys, but they'll most likely just give you an item you already have, money, and some healing items, so it isn't very fruitful going back to look for any secrets, and it doesn't affect the games ending (to my knowledge).\n\nThe material system is really there for you to make some quick cash, since a lot of the materials  needed to craft certain items can be easily purchased or found in a couple minutes of combat. I only ever crafted a few items in the game, but more often than not I quickly replaced them with an item from a chest I just happened upon. \n\nOverall, for one guy doing 90% of the game by himself, this is a very impressive game with lots of fun combat and platforming, but it falls short in story, crafting, and difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1636338828, "timestamp_updated": 1636338828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102369864": {"recommendationid": "102369864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044121334", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1636271558}, "language": "english", "review": "This game turned me into a furry.", "timestamp_created": 1636271601, "timestamp_updated": 1636271601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 39, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714431464672088623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102365465": {"recommendationid": "102365465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069154360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1634619995}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little story, and great combat for a side scroller.

Maybe I've played too many games/metroidvanias and I'm too picky or whatever, but I found this game to be mind-numbingly boring and grindy.  \n\nIn terms of exploration or searching for secrets, there's no point.  You won't find any new items, upgrades, or anything interesting at all.  Instead you'll find more useless keys for more useless chests that give you more useless gold that you've already got so much of that you have nothing to spend it on. That's the only incentive to explore. Once you realize that every chest just gives you more of what you already have (but don't need), and reaching them is some minor jumping puzzle or whatever, you realize there's just no point at all.  Other metroidvanias encourage exploration, this game discourages it.\n\nAdmittedly the combat is fun and fluid at first.  The problem is, the levels are so long and basically all the same, with the same variety of enemies over and over and over again, that it gets extremely boring very fast.  There are only so many ways that you can string together combos, and once you figure them all out, there's nothing more to do or learn.  Unfortunately for me this happened about a half hour into the game, so combat and abilities effecting combat were figured out extremely early on.  Eventually it just got tedious and I started skipping enemies, because why do the same thing 100 more times if I don't have to?\n\nBack to exploration.  I like puzzles.  I like games that make me think.  This has none of that.  No puzzles, no figuring anything out besides looking at a basic map and figuring out whether to go up, down, left, or right, and that's basically it.  Turn you brain off, button mash, and enjoy the story.\n\nWhat about the story then?  Is it good?  Brooding protagonist forgets his memory, starts to do good things for people, slowly finds out that he was actually a bad guy in the past, and you know the rest.  Kind of trope-y.  It's not bad, but I really really really really really really cannot stand the voice actor for Dust (the protagonist).  His lines sound forced and that thing he's doing with his voice is annoying.  You'll know it when you hear it.  He sounds like a teenager who is trying to sound mysterious and tough/alfalfa.  His companion is also a bit much.  \n\nI have some minor gripes with the movement/animations, namely jump height is fixed and there is a weird delay between when you think you've landed, and when you can actually jump again, so every time you land on a platform you have to wait a little bit to jump to the next one. It lead to me falling off things a lot and kinda pissed me off.  Other than that I guess the controls are fine though.\n\nI'd prefer if steam had something in between recommending and not, because I'd pick that, but I really can't recommend this game for someone who wants to play a good metroidvania.  It really isn't a metroidvania in a true sense, it's a linear action platformer where you can backtrack if you want, but with no incentive at all to actually backtrack, no puzzles, nothing but beat em up and a story that you may or may not care about.  I'd give it a 6/10 I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1628143456, "timestamp_updated": 1628143456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96961778": {"recommendationid": "96961778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314659541", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1628128453}, "language": "english", "review": "Fails with brainless action and platforming.

Instead of a ridiculously huge laundry list of combos that other hack n' slash games possess (God of War, Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania ect.), it's just a few different button combinations in conjunction with spamming magic projectiles with the help of your furry flying friend Fidget. The entire feel of the combat is deeply satisfying and addicting, and I found myself always experimenting and changing things up from time to time as opposed to just mashing the X button to get by because I forgot all the combos like in those aforementioned games. On top of all that, Dust: An Elysian Tail had one of the most compelling, and downright heartbreaking stories in gaming history. I'm a 30 year old man, and the ending made me cry like a baby, it's also hilarious at times so it's a great mix. Not only is the storyline emotional, it's incredibly well-written and full of lore to flesh out the world and its inhabitants. With TONS of deep and insightful dialogue, unforgettable characters, and plenty of awesome side quests, Dust draws you into its world every bit as much as any AAA BioWare-esque RPG.

The \"true 100%\" is actually 117%, and I try to only write reviews when I fully completed a game, just so I can experience everything. The fact that 95% of this game was made by one guy (Dean Dodrill) is mind blowing. The controls are fluid with the character, and the gameplay is phenomenal for a hack and slash game. The story had me cry multiple times, and it's a shame I will never be able to enjoy this game again as I did the first time. My emotions were a roller coaster, and that's how all games should be. They need to make you bond with the characters, and this game did just that. (And it has a killer soundtrack on top of all of it.)\n\nI am honestly trying to think of any negatives for this game, but the only thing that comes to mind is not enough animated cutscenes. However, only one guy did this, so I cannot blame him for making the cutscenes like a visual novel. That being said, the visual novel cutscenes also had small animations and different poses/emotions for the characters instead of the characters being just a still picture of them. So I can't complain.\n\nAs for backtracking, it can be seen a good or bad. If you want the story to progress, you DO NOT need to back track at all. However, if you want some more powerful items/skills/etc for your character, then some backtracking will be required, but you will have new abilities to use when backtracking. So, that being said, you will discover something new when doing so.\n\nWith that, I recommend you get this game, and fully complete it.

Combat is simple but feels great as your doing it, making you feel powerful but preventing button mashing by needing to parry attacks mid to late game, and allowing variation with other abilities. exploration isn't too hard or easy, you shouldn't need to look up a guide for any items if you have enough patience and any notes you pick up.

Overall I would say this is a great game and up there with some of the best indies, if you like Metroidvanias this is a must play.", "timestamp_created": 1626324111, "timestamp_updated": 1626324111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95762697": {"recommendationid": "95762697", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987341172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 1754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1754, "last_played": 1626323047}, "language": "english", "review": "An old one (I first played this on the 360) but having finished it a worthwhile play\n\nStory and characters are excellent and the action rpg gameplay is fun\n\nGraphic style still looks good\n\nAll in all worth a look", "timestamp_created": 1626323192, "timestamp_updated": 1626323192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95716815": {"recommendationid": "95716815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043081412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 1728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1728, "last_played": 1609589632}, "language": "english", "review": "Dust: An Elysian Tail, while seemingly simple on the surface, is a game of hidden charm and deserves a closer look. Featuring a gorgeous, hand-drawn world, this 2D sidescroller may not innovate in many areas, but what it does do, it tends to do very well.\n\nYou play as Dust, an anthropomorphic animal (of some sort) who seems to have a mild case of amnesia. While on his quest to help the characters he encounters, he uncovers more of his past, comes to grip with his true identity and saves the day. While the story is not in itself remarkable, the mechanics of the game behind it are.\n\nThe combat, while simplistic at first, develops with light RPG-like elements and you grow more powerful as you progress. The fluidity and responsiveness of the controls and character is perhaps the best of any game I have ever played: if you die, you will know that it was your fault and not down to input or delay (other than your own). The voice acting is on par (perhaps nothing special, but fitting for the setting), characterisation is done well and the beauty of the game world and surroundings deserve a second mention. There is also no problem with settings or the game being demanding: it remained locked at my refresh rate at maximum resolution for the duration of my playthrough.\n\nIt is difficult to consider this game as anything other than a labour of love, and as an outstanding example (as well as an exceptional port) of what one person can achieve when they dedicate themselves to something; after playing it is difficult to believe most of the work was done by one person, but also easy to understand why it took years to accomplish. All in all, as a package it is wonderfully done and well worth the price of entrance.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone who enjoys Metroidvania or platforming games.\n\nPlayed on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any issues.", "timestamp_created": 1626259577, "timestamp_updated": 1626259577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688881993293762207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95663437": {"recommendationid": "95663437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249239038", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1626584030}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most beautiful solo projects I've seen.", "timestamp_created": 1626183186, "timestamp_updated": 1626183186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95579529": {"recommendationid": "95579529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068916215", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 546, "last_played": 1620274152}, "language": "english", "review": "This was one of those games that had been sitting in my backlog for some time now, and was something I had heard good things about yet just never got around to. Well, now I have, and I suppose it's time I gave my opinion on it.\n\nThe first thing I think needs to be said about this game is how the spirit of its development almost traces back to the infancy of video games -- think the age of bedroom coders where one to four people did all the work on the game. Such is the case with this one -- one guy did all of the programming, artwork, story, and everything except the voice acting and music, really. Had you told me that going in, I would have been skeptical of how good this could be.\n\nSurprisingly, it all comes together quite well. The game blends several genres together in a manner that makes it hard to argue exactly what genre it belongs to, yet it never feels undecided or unfocused. First and foremost, the game is a 2D sidescroller. It is also a hack-and-slash, as the game is heavily focused on combat and trying to find ways to take out hordes of enemies. On top of that, we also get a levelling and inventory management system akin to an RPG, with a little bit of platforming thrown in for good measure and a pinch of Metroidvania (leaning more on the \"vania\" side of the equation). This amount of genre mixing can easily go wrong in so many ways, yet it somehow manages to make it come together. The combat is very fun and enjoyable to work your way around, and is engaging enough that it never feels repetitive.\n\nThe game makes it work even better by sporting an amazing hand-drawn look. Every element of the game appears to have a painted appearance, including the backgrounds, the character models, and all the enemies. It really does feel like a painted scene that came to life. Again, props to the maker of this game for having such a wide array of talents that he managed to weave together.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it's not especially original -- a chosen one is on a quest to save his people, and he visits a bunch of different villages who need help along the way. It's pretty much nothing you haven't heard before, but what carries the game isn't so much its story, but its characters, some of whom you may grow attached to and enjoy getting to know. And since even Dust doesn't know who he is when the game starts, it keeps you hooked in wanting to know the answers to that. At several points the game got unexpectedly dark too. All of the dialogue is voice acted as well, and that's all quite well done.\n\nThis isn't a particularly challenging game. Once you get a feel for the combat, it isn't long before you start using the same moves over and over again. That said, the combat is deep enough that you still have to be focused when fighting off enemies, so at least it never becomes outright boring. The biggest thing that breaks the game is the special abilities granted to you by Fidget, as they attack pretty much every enemy on screen. You can pretty much carry yourself through the game spamming her attacks.\n\nThe game isn't particularly long either -- it's only five chapters, but with the exception of the third which amounts to doing the same thing four times, they're all pretty good and have varied environments. There are also sidequests you can take on if you want to, but they're not mandatory and simply grant you extra experience points.\n\nDust is overall an alright game. It definitely shines compared to many other indie games, but still isn't anything I'd call must-play. If the art style appeals to you, and you like action games, then I'd say it's worth a play.", "timestamp_created": 1626063451, "timestamp_updated": 1626063451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95564083": {"recommendationid": "95564083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073424376", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1625791771}, "language": "english", "review": "Dust is a very fun but short and repetitive Metrovania.

I had looked at it before I bought it and thought it might be good, but it was better than the reviews and my own initial impressions lead me to believe. The lighthearted banter between the characters is made better by the voice acting, which was cast quite well. The dynamic between the two main characters kept me invested in what was going to happen to them. Their struggle to find out who Dust really is (surprise, surprise, another amnesia character in a video game. I wish they would stop with this troupe already) is interesting and I will admit that I didn't see things turning out the way that they did. It was a pleasant surprise. \n\n\tAs far as the visuals, they look vibrant and colorful. Objects and backgrounds merge together in a very natural way so that everything looks as though it belongs, but there is no confusion about what you can interact with.  The music didn't stand out one way or the other for me. If the music isn't going to be noticeably good, I usually prefer it to be like this so it doesn't distract me from the game itself. Speaking of the gameplay, the puzzles aren't too difficult for the most part. There are a few that will take a bit of thought to figure out, but most of it is just exploring. And because of the loot you will want to collect to get access to new pieces of equipment, you will be exploring the world regardless. The equipment is on the basic side and the newest piece is usually the best, but there are some fun things thrown in there to play with too!\n\n\tHowever, the main reason to play this game is easily the fluid and enjoyable combat. Attacking is just plain fun here! I enjoyed the movement from the start and my enjoyment only increased as I got new abilities to make that movement even more dynamic. Id say the combat is something like Castlevania merged with Street Fighter. You have a few basic combos, lots of vertical movement along with different angles to attack your foes from, a small collection of magic attacks, counterattacks, and all of this plays out in a 2.5D world that lends itself to trying new attacks to react to different situations often. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the metroidvania style of game, fluid and fun combat, anime humour, and entertaining characters!", "timestamp_created": 1625807767, "timestamp_updated": 1625807767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95349625": {"recommendationid": "95349625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051780042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1541, "last_played": 1625770812}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game, had an amazing time playing it", "timestamp_created": 1625770851, "timestamp_updated": 1625770851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95288934": {"recommendationid": "95288934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015225029", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 131, "last_played": 1613416392}, "language": "english", "review": "stylish action game for combo-loving fiends", "timestamp_created": 1625698776, "timestamp_updated": 1625698776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95257409": {"recommendationid": "95257409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096095455", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1513012055}, "language": "english", "review": "Just amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1625667354, "timestamp_updated": 1625667354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95229613": {"recommendationid": "95229613", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096930696", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 521, "last_played": 1670696242}, "language": "english", "review": "A timeless classic for the ages", "timestamp_created": 1625634543, "timestamp_updated": 1625634543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95153966": {"recommendationid": "95153966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198425359947", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1635085420}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is adorable and awesome!", "timestamp_created": 1625544444, "timestamp_updated": 1625544444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95123197": {"recommendationid": "95123197", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986473661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1228, "last_played": 1625507277}, "language": "english", "review": "What a fantastic game.

I decided not to play it on Hardcore because I value my sanity and know where I like my challenge to be.\n\nLike others may have told you, do not be so easily deceived by the game's use of anthropomorphic characters; it uses them in a way that allows some... gruesome concepts to be touched upon without muddling the message with humans in the mix. Also, many other movies and games have used such a foundation for characters and proved to deliver great experiences, so don't judge this game on that alone.\n\nThe gameplay is quite nice and is a combination of hack and slash combat and metroidvania progression. You'll be cleaving down hordes of foes with a fair few tricks in their behavior to keep you on your toes, and the environmental hazards like the tried and true spikes can actually hurt quite a lot on higher difficulties, and they're certain death on Hardcore as well. This game makes you feel like a unstoppable menace by the time you're halfway through, where even the toughest enemies in the earlier areas cannot help but deal less than 1% of your health with a single hit. This game can be completed relatively easy, especially if you like to check around every possible direction in an area like I do.\n\nThe score is wonderful and definitely fits the varying tones and environments greatly. My favorite environmental track would have to be the one for the [spoiler] Cirromon Caverns [/spoiler], though all the others hold up well. The artstyle is appealing and reminds me of a combination of Western and Anime styles, and a few little details here and there, like the bits when in the world map, are always nice to see. The characters are likable and never feel inherently annoying, and the trinity dynamic of Dust, Fidget, and Ahrah's personalities is charming.\n\nOf all the things this game could be better including, I only have two small things in mind: a bit more enemy variety in some areas\u2014[spoiler] 1 to 2 more enemies that had guarding moves or shields would have been nice to change up combat [/spoiler]\u2014and just some neat idle animations to add more charm to the main trio. But then again, the game is still great to play despite this, and the fact that most of it fell under the effort of one person is truly remarkable.\n\nIn short, if you like beating down a bunch of foes with a sword and some magick with some mainline metroidvania progression built in, then this is the game for you.

I'd owned the game for a while and managed to finish my first \u201ccasual\u201d run years ago and found that I remembered very little about it with the exception of the visual design, a few locations and the story's twist-ending.\n\nSo with some time to kill and on a metroidvania binge I decided I'd run through the game a second time on \u201ctough\u201d difficulty.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is a metroidvania, borrowing only the bare-bones elements of the genre such as abilities that are given at certain locations, a levelling system where you're given points to spend on four stats that increase your durability and damage output. There's a crafting system in the form of blueprints that drop form enemies or chests that you can use the make equipment that boost your stats even further or give increase in gold and drop rates.\n\nI really liked the ability to sell materials that you found in your travels, eliminating the grind for them when you wanted to craft stronger equipment. Sure it defeated the purpose of killing enemies for loot, but I think it balanced out with the need for money to buy what you needed.\n\nThe game's strong point is definitely its visual design, with amazing animation, background art and level design. Along with a decent soundtrack that had a mixture of ambience for the areas and rocking tunes for the more action-packed areas.\n\nEverything else is where the game falls a just a bit short and barely passes the \u201cokay\u201d mark, never trying to engage the player or allow them to explore and infer at their own leisure. The story is mediocre at best and doesn't try to go out of its way to expand on the world and characters by adding optional narrative fluff. There's only one example of a character that talks about the history of the area they're in and even that's glanced over in two paragraphs.\n\nThe characters themselves weren't all that interesting, which wasn't helped by the majority of them having awful voice acting to convey their personality. A few of them were done alright, but I particularly couldn't stand the main character's voice.\n\nTo allow some semblance of character development, the game forces you to stop playing to throw a brief cutscene into your face when you pick up a new ability, stumble into a puzzle or come face to face with new enemies. Which is a real shame, because the level design and the various mechanics are perfectly implemented to teach the player on its own merits without the game holding your hand.\n\nWhat's left then is the combat which doesn't fare much better in engaging the player. Enemies are basically money pi\u00f1atas with little threat beyond the odd enemy that explode or needs to be parried. They possess a sluggish AI that attacks at set intervals and occasionally jumps behind you, and with little variety in enemies all you did was clear the room and move on to the next. The main hazards are environmental pits, spikes, thorns and lava pools that do a significant amount of damage when you fall into them.\n\nWhat about exploration then? That's even less of a challenge. Chests and pickups are literally thrust into your face, and the few secret areas that do require some thinking to get to aren't that cryptic.

The detailed environments, the graphical effects and the combat all feel so alive. The character art is adorable, and while the story feels light-hearted much of the time it is also quite dark, which makes for a punchy contrast. I didn't cry, though. I was just bleeding water from my eyes.\n\nI played this back when it was released first. It didn't sync with me at all. I don't think I had the patience back then. This time around though I couldn't figure out what had annoyed me. Everything feels so polished. Sure, there are annoyances here and there (such as how far you'll fly back if hurt by hazards) but being careful and not getting hurt while dominating the screen with your massive streams of death - which is highly possible - makes those \"fails\" super rare and, well, fitting. It is clear that you're not supposed to get hurt at all.\n\nThe platforming is most of the time not masochistically hard, which I like. The game is not designed to make you angry, but it still has its tricky parts - especially the optional challenges spread around the world.\n\nMy only gripe, I think, is that while Fidget will mark rooms you enter containing undiscovered treasure, there seem to be no way of actually finding hidden rooms except stumbling upon them. I have cleared regions on the map without reaching 100% on them and unless I've missed something, finding the hidden rooms there becomes a tedious act of slashing at every wall.\n\nAbsolutely great game.

A lot of work went into the art, and it's not retro pixel, which is to be appluaded.  It is furry art, however, which is creepy.   You get interrupted by badly written dialogue constantly.   The camera could handle being zoomed out a little more, so you can see where you're platforming.\n\nI imagine this was very successful amongst console peasants who are also furries, but this really doesn't feel like a PC game at all.   They're also charging $15 for a console ported platformer, so that's ambitious.

Twenty-five\u2026yeah, sounds like a special number to me, so let\u2019s review a game that is near and dear to my heart, even after so many years have passed since its release.\n\nEven with all the dozens of titles I\u2019ve enjoyed, even with all the positive accolades I\u2019ve given thus far, not a singe game I\u2019ve talked about has simply owned my heart like this one. Dust isn\u2019t just a game. It\u2019s a freaking EXPERIENCE. As far as I\u2019m concerned, if you haven\u2019t played this game yet, you owe it to yourself to buy this small slice of epic greatness and see for yourself just what a labor of love looks like.\n\nI don\u2019t normally gush like this to start with, but there\u2019s so many good things to say.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the story, as I usually do. In this\u2026tail? Really? Anyway, this tale sees you as Dust, the titular hero that appears out of nowhere one day and winds up going on an adventure with Fidget, a nimbat, and a sword that can talk. Dust\u2019s main hook is that he is an amnesiac. Uh-oh, red flag right? Well, as it turns out, this amnesiac story is actually one of the good ones, as it doesn\u2019t try to beat you over the head with the whole amnesia thing. Instead, Dust the hero is simply that: a hero that, having recently come into the world, decides to make the most of his time by helping out the locals, and boy, does he have some helping out to do! The big issue in these parts is that a genocidal authority figure known as Gaius is trying to exterminate a group of beings known as moonbloods. Along the way, Dust will eventually come to know his true identity, something I won\u2019t spoil here. All I will say is that the story is magnificently told, with good writing and enjoyable characters all around. Even the folks that dole out side quests are fun to talk to. The mysterious merchant you run into here and there has to be my favorite, just because of how, well, mysterious he is and the curiosity he drums up. Ultimately, this game has all sorts of wonderful moments in the story that can really evoke some emotion. Pro tip: bring some kleenex for the ending.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Dust shines further still. It\u2019s basically a metroidvania filled with places to explore, quests to fulfill, and plenty of enemies to slaughter. That\u2019s all well and good, but the combat really makes it all worthwhile. The main gimmick behind Dust\u2019s fighting style is the dust storm, a maneuver that\u2019s essentially \u201cDust the sword-wielding tornado runs over everything.\u201d You can even combine it with various magic abilities to pretty much screen-clear most areas. It\u2019s fun to use, but there was a clever sort of balancing effect added in. Simply put, if you use dust storm too long, you\u2019ll take damage. Alternatively, there\u2019s also various button combos that can be utilized for more conventional fighting. It all sounds simple, and yet it never gets boring!\n\nIn addition, the combat not only IS good, but also LOOKS incredible. Wait, scratch that. The whole GAME looks incredible! It\u2019s amazing to me how even 2D games can be given such a visually captivating appearance, but Humble Hearts pulled it off. The environments are pure eye candy, and each unique biome stands out in so many ways. Plus, the animated character sprites have so much detail to them, and add to the world\u2019s colorful vibes. Between that and the spell effects from the dust storm attacks, your eyeballs will be in for a treat.\n\nThen there\u2019s the sound design, which I believe was the only part the game\u2019s creator had any help with. The official soundtrack has thirty seven pieces of music, and every last one of them is pure joy to listen to. Each bit of music adds to every area, with moods ranging from peaceful and mysterious to outright thrilling and suspenseful. It certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that the various sounds effects, especially from combat, add that extra bit of oomph to the excitement. Finally, the voice acting\u2026every last bit of it is very well done; not a single character\u2019s voice feels out of place, the vocals themselves make the game that much more memorable.\n\nAll that said, I do admittedly have a couple problems with the game(Gasp! Problems?!). For one, the boss battles are a joke. Well, most of them. The last few phases against the final boss are actually challenging, but the others just seem to be no match for the dust storm attack. That isn\u2019t to say they aren\u2019t fun in their own way, but it\u2019d been nice if the bosses as a whole could put up a bigger fight. The other issue is the crafting system. Now, the crafting itself is not an issue; being able to make gear in this game, heck, in any game like this, is fun. My issue is the fact that, at least from my experience, you really don\u2019t need to craft. The game gives you plenty of items to help you through the game, healing and otherwise. In fact, there is an item(can\u2019t remember the exact name) that auto-revives you after you lose all your health. I\u2019m sure some people out there will find the crafting thing fun, it just wasn\u2019t something I found really necessary.\n\nSo there you have it, a game that I loved so much, that during my short stints on youtube and vidme, I used Dust as my avatar! This game right here is, as I said, a labor of love; you can see all of the work, care and creativity that went into this project, and it shows in just how many accolades it has received. My hats off to Humble Hearts for this amazing game, and one of the handful of titles that shows how kickstarter should be used.\n\nNow hurry up and make a sequel.

Play if you're in need of a Metroidvania, but know that there's better out there.\n\nArt: 4/10 the character aren't very pleasing, nor are they animated well. I was expecting more of a Korean vibe since it has Korean in it's name, but honestly, besides a few houses, it's very similar to the typical Western fantasy.\nPlot: 2/10 Wouldn't know because I skipped the plot. All of their dialogue felt very intrusive, redundant, and unnecessarily long. They felt the need to comment on the most obvious things and make cut scenes where there need not be. From the start I was not interested in the plot. \nMovement: It tries to be a platformer. It's not great at it. The pov camera is too zoomed in so you can never tell where you're jumping more than one platform at a time, and due to the way movement works, it's hard to tell if some area's are reachable if you tried harder or if you're jumping towards an impossible task. You do sort of have a flying technique but it's hard to manipulate, though it can be pretty fun. But outside of that skill you move very slowly, making backtracking for treasure gathering a chore. \nCombat: Really the only best part of this game. It's fast and you throw characters around the screen a lot so you feel powerful, though near the end levels the screen gets so chaotic you're just button mashing hoping to hit something. Your defense is generally so low that you are incapable of tanking hits, meaning the best way to fight is to stun lock enemies mid-air, which gets boring fast.", "timestamp_created": 1615507223,

Combat consists of mashing a key most of the time. The storyline is clich\u00e9d, the furry aspect rather creepy, and the constant chatter of this character or that one got old about five minutes in. To top that off, several aspects of gameplay design feel odd and half-baked, like the weird teleport system.\n\nI played it to completion, because even with those things it isn't a bad game. It's fun, if you're looking for something extremely simplistic. For children [strike]and sexual perverts[/strike] the art style and storyline might be quite attractive.\n\nMaybe if I had played this in 2013 when it released I would've liked it more. But as is, I played this in 2020 - and after having played through Hollow Knight, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Blasphemous. Let's just say all three of those games far outdo this one, though then again all three of them are also much newer.\n\nOnce again, not a bad game.

Summarized, these seem all too ordinary and not at all special, but presentation helped it convey so well that it captivated me. If I simply explain the story you might think \"okay, well that is not so great\", but it strikes a meaningful resonance with my early years.

But it never was an Early Access game. It is, however, a niche game that is a labour of love from one guy who spent several years making this, and boy, was it time well spent!\n\nYou'll instantly be struck with the gorgeous characters and animation and not for the first time wonder \"one guy did all this?\" But it's more than this.\n\nThe game is essentially a metroidvania style in the lightest sense of the word. It's 2D, and the combat is especially good with fabulous fluid animations, and you have a range of areas you'll need to progress through, and a few you may have to revisit. The story is quite lovely and thoroughly heartwarming and entertaining - and I usually ignore stories in a lot of games. It takes a lot to impress me on this point. You start off in the world with amnesia, and immediately come across an adorable sidekick - Fidget, a flying, squirrely, cat, fox type ... thing. Their interplay is again lovely to experience, truly endearing stuff. As you come across other characters, you will talk to them not just for exposition's sake, but the occasional sidequest too. As it's not a linear game, these side quests can largely be handled as and when you want, or ignored. As there is a basic levelling system (which really just helps keep you alive longer), you can either get rewarded with better equipment or some item involved in rudimentary crafting (for better equipment). Killing certain enemies drops particular items, of course.\n\nThe game probably wraps up in about 5 hours (or perhaps more if you aren't rushing through it), and it's absolutely perfect length. It never outstays it's welcome and it wraps things up nicely. Note that I don't have much playtime on here, as I've played it thoroughly on 360, and PS4. \n\nAS for the downsides, frankly I can't think of any. It really is a perfectly polished game.\n\nSo if you're perhaps wading through the massive choice of retro 2D sidescrollers/platformers/whatever, and don't know what to get, then this should absolutely be top of your list. It's a true testament to how good a labour of love can be, and how when given time to work, you can make masterpieces without having to cut stuff.\n\nThis game is so much of a perfect game, that it should be in a list of games that EVERY Steam user must own.", "timestamp_created": 1610076229, "timestamp_updated": 1610077823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66656118631362915", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84220708": {"recommendationid": "84220708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167067563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1610027125}, "language": "english", "review": "Story is real corny.

But there are a lot of negatives when it comes to level design and story.  There's just so much backtracking in this game.  If you find a chest, you might not be able to open because you also have to find a key which is also hidden around the world.  So whenever you find a key or two then you have to go back and refind the chests you couldn't pick up at the time.  Also many of the quests involve you talking to the character you received the quest from again, well it's pretty tedious to walk through the quite large town area looking for the character again.  Everything is just repeated.\n\nAlso, playing on normal difficulty the combat is a bit simple, so I'd recommend you start on a harder one.  On this note, I question the experience point system.  There's an area near the beginning of the game where you have to do this flying attack thing to get a chest far above the level, it is difficult to pull off and if you empty the air of enemies you must leave the screen and try again.  Well, in a normal platforming game without experience points, trying the same thing over until you get it is fine, but here while I was trying and failing I probably gained half a dozen levels and each level gives you an enormous stats boost.  Now, I'm definitely overpowered for the nearby monsters.  Why have an experience point system at all in a game like this?

This game might have turned me into a furry?\nWhy is it so enjoyable... And yet so simple... And yet so damn charming?! I don't understand.\nI only know this made me feel... Feelings for... (possibly Korean?) Humanoid rabbit-foxes wielding swords? (Is that what he is?!)\nI don't know and I don't even care. Just give me more...\n\nMore seriously, though, while of course it isn't perfect, this game does have an irresistible charm. It's the kind of game that, writing this review some time after my second playthrough, has me wonder why the heck did I even enjoy it so much. It's simple, basic even, some secondary characters' designs look rough, it has a rushed third act... But I loved it.\n\nThere is something quite nostalgic about it-- so much of it being a homage to older classics-- but still manages to retain some freshness.\nYou recognise the archetypes (in the characters, in the aesthetics of the world, in the story), but at the same time all these elements manage to impose their own identity, thus feeling like their own thing rather than some pretty nostalgic mash.  There's something about it that definitely feels like a love letter to certain narratives, but it's somehow hard to be bothered by it. \n\nWhile the gameplay is quite basic, this makes for a very nice, relaxing experience. Movement is fluid. The animation is incredible. You don't have many moves but you'll still look insanely badass.  The music is fantastic. The story is surprisingly decent, even touching sometimes, and it has some quite memorable lines that don't even feel like petty one-liners (HOW?)\nThe voice acting might sound a bit off occasionally, but the main characters do a pretty good job, never breaking the mood with odd deliveries. They share a good chemistry, and they are often genuinely humorous, but also capable of making you feel for them when they are going through some turmoil. \nWhile some bits of animation and of secondary characters designs do look a bit off, it is generally pretty damn good.\nUntil you realise they're all the work of one guy... So, yeah, fucking stellar!\n\nSome people have raised criticisms against the lack of difficulty and redundancy of the main game mechanic of smashing enemies to no end.\nIt is true that the game is focused more on killing enemies than on tough platforming bits, so if that's not your thing you might be better off with something else, but the range of difficulties shouldn't scare anyone away.\nThe game doesn't force you to use a strategy, but that doesn't mean you can't try to come up with alternative ways of playing. Avoid getting health items or something. Find your own way of playing.\n\nI played the first time on tough mode, and the second one on hardcore. I thought tough mode was a pretty good way to experience some tension while also enjoying the moment.\nHardcore can be a bit of a nuisance, as you're easily one-shotted or severly hurt. There also isn't much time to experience the way bosses fight and their cool moves if you don't want to die, but then again it is hardcore. It's not as hardcore as other games' more punishing mechanics, but I personally didn't find it to be an issue.\n\nMy one issue/regret might be that there isn't more. Something about it made me feel like this was the kind of game that would bring you on a long-ass journey, but maybe that's just wishful thinking, derived from the fact that it felt epic enough to last a bit longer (even with 2 playthroughs, my displayed runtime is mostly due to costant background running.

Nice mechanics and maps. I enjoyed the game while playing it. However: \n\n(Spoiler alert)\n\n[spoiler]after hours of unlocking everything, the ending of the main story was simply a huge letdown. Throughout the cutscenes the main villain (and final boss) General Gaius has been depicted (with asides) as someone who is humane. This contrasts with what is actually happening in the game world, and what everyone else reports. So the player is set up to wonder about how this apparent conflict should reconcile, and is therefore encouraged to dig deeper into the story. Yet, at the end, there was nothing, General Gaius simply is the genocidal Nazi he is. And still, he is shown as almost 'compassionate', which makes no sense in the story (it serves no function in the story. We don't need such lengthy story to tell us a trivial fact that a character can be inconsistent). This is just a massive fail in the plot, and an intelligent player would simply feel cheated. There is nothing deep about showing that a Nazi can be compassionate. And if the idea was to show that a Nazi can be a good person in the context of his campaign to wipe out another race, then the author has missed his own point. Perhaps the author is trying to show the 'banality of evil' \u2013 just how misguided and stupid General Gaius is, even though he has a gentle nature. Sorry but these simply do not fit into the plot, which is a cliched 'save the world' plot. As I mentioned, throughout the story the player is presented with a conflict. At the end, this conflict isn't resolved, at all. In fact the ending scene just regurgitates the mystical conflicting element that permeated throughout the game. Except that when seen at the end, it just became an absolute failure, disappointing and irritating. The conflict was merely constructed as a tool to lure the player to keep on playing. Hence why I said the player will feel cheated, and let down. \n\nThe player is presented with the illusion of making choices but they make no difference to the game. In general, there are too many random NON-FUNCTIONAL elements mixed together without thought about how they fit together and why they're even there (e.g. 2 souls). [/spoiler]\n\nTherefore, I do not recommend this game, as I think it's just a waste of time. The game mechanics, while enjoyable, isn't deep enough to stand on itself. Exploring the story is a main reason why one would keep on playing (and there is no endgame post story).

After that point the repetitiveness of the combat really started to show, and it's even more apparent with the sheer number of fodder enemies placed haphazardly across all of the (very linear) levels.  There's a few interesting elements to it, but the combat in the end just boils down to mindless button-mashing and the occasional special move when you feel like mixing it up a little.  It doesn't evolve very much across the ~10 hour story, and ends up getting very boring by the game's conclusion.  It isn't helped at all by the boring platforming that seems like it's just there because this game is a 2D sidescroller, and does pretty much nothing but take up time.\n\nAnd the story... oh, the story.  It shows a little bit of promise at the beginning, but soon reveals itself to be cliche-ridden, predictable, and boring, filled with one-note characters and potentially interesting plot beats that very little is done with.  The voice acting, while not amazing, does a lot to help the experience, except when the lines the actors are reading are bad to the point of cringeworthy (which luckily isn't incredibly often).  The dialogue in general has a very amateurish feel to it, and is full of lame humor and misguided attempts to provoke emotion that more often than not just come across as forced.  It has a couple of good moments, but I'm not exaggerating when I say \"a couple\".  Most of the story is bland and doesn't feel worth investing anything into.\n\nHowever, this game does have two glorious redeeming qualities that unfortunately don't make up for its shortcomings, but are nevertheless definitely worth mentioning.  One is the music, which is on the level of many classic JRPGs.  The game is full of absolutely amazing pieces of music, which set the scene perfectly in cutscenes and levels, and there's enough variety that you'll never get bored.  Even if you don't play the game, I'd recommend looking up the soundtrack and giving it a listen if you're interested.  \nThe second redeeming quality is something you've probably noticed if you've looked at any videos or screenshots of this game, and that's the art and animation.  Holy crap does it look great.  The 2D sprites, especially the player character's, move smoothly and look incredible, and the backgrounds are similarly impressive.  The guy who made this game is an artist, and it's very apparent that art is his forte.  There are a few fully-animated cutscenes in the game, and they're beautiful as well, each one leaving me wanting more.  Honestly, if this game was a movie, I'd watch it just for the animation and probably not regret it.\n\nBut it isn't a movie, it's a game, and at the end of the day it isn't a very good one.  Graphics and music can only carry an experience so far, and the \"game\" part of this game is incredibly repetitive and uninteresting, with a forgettable story running alongside it.  Still, I don't regret spending $4.75 on this game, although I imagine I would if I paid full price.  The graphics and music are great and I'm glad to support a creator who clearly has a lot of potential.  If he ever makes a sequel to this, I hope that he'll iron out the kinks and emphasize what's great, and if he does we'll probably have an excellent game on our hands.", "timestamp_created": 1605564718, "timestamp_updated": 1605564718, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500291585922241211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79362263": {"recommendationid": "79362263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140329292", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1607273844}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is insanely incredible, and if not to be considered a timeless classic.

A lot of love went into this fantastic metroidvania game from the anime-inspired artwork, fun and lovable characters, and it's deep and well written story.

The final battle plays out in truly epic fashion with power behind the dialogue and score, which leads to a very satisfying ending that leaves it open for a sequel. There is also plenty to do with several sidequests, challenges, equipment, and collectibles. Even with some minor gameplay issues, I enjoyed every minute I had with Dust, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a richly detailed world and story with a dash of fast-paced metroidvania gameplay.

It's metroidvania-lite. Most of the time you're just hacking away or utilizing 1 of 3 Dust Storm abilities to clear the screen of enemies. Progression relies of navigating fruit bombs and just good platforming skills such as observing moving platforms and timing. Very few puzzles. \n\nAlso very lite RPG mechanics as killing enemies gets you loot and experience. Get enough experience, level up, and invest in 1 of 4 combat stats. With the loot, you use it to craft equipment to boost you combat stats. Story progression is linear with few explorable dialog trees.\n\nVisually speaking, Dust: An Elysian Tail is a good looking game in a cartoon-like environment. The animation looks like it received it a lot of effort. Also, I really enjoyed the audio from sound fx, spoken dialog, and most of all, the music. The voice acting is really good if you can look past some of the cheeziness of the game.\n\nWhen I say cheeziness, there's several tropes prevalent throughout the game. Fortunately, I was able to look past them. Take them in stride. Honestly, it's a good story for the effort. The development team really have something mostly cohesive and competent, and I can definitely see a sequel (about 8 years since this game was release there is no sequel).\n\nMy only complaints with the game is just some of it feels repetitive or boring. There's one area where I wish I could just finish because I was so tired of it. I was tired of just beating up all the enemies. I had to take a break and do some chores to get over the monotony. After that, I was mostly driven knowing I was about halfway through the game and could power through. \n\nI might come back around to get some or all the remaining achievements.

The game world consists of two-dimensional levels. The player takes control of the title character Dust, who tries to remember his past. Dust has a living sword, the Ahrah Blade. Fidget, the guardian of the sword, acts as Dust's companion and can fire projectiles.\n\nIn the course of the game, the player can find power-ups that permanently change the game mechanics, such as the ability to perform a double jump or to climb to a previously unreachable level. The game also includes elements of role-playing games; Dust can gain experience points by defeating opponents and thus level up. Thus, various values, such as hit points or magic points, can be increased.

The controls work well, the game is smooth, the music and art range from \"not bad\" to \"very good,\" and all of this was done by essentially a one-man team.\n\nBut the story. Oh, the story. Spoilers ahead.\n\nYou play as Dust, an amnesiac fighting a one-athro war against a legion of monsters and soldiers threatening the land as you try to recover your memory. The problem is that the talking sword you get clearly knows all about your past, but it's not telling. [spoiler] \"Soon,\" it says, as villages burn, caves collapse, and townspeople either turn away from you in fear. Plot twist, it turns out that you were created by forcing the souls of an omnicidal assassin and a random kid by a bunch of lizard people in order to create the ultimate weapon and save them from genocide.[/spoiler]\n\nIs there any exploration of this? No, you're totally fine with it. You have no problem with being kept in the dark for 80% of the game, and even fewer problems with becoming exactly the weapon you were created to be. There is a Good Side and an Evil Side, and the story simply can't comprehend that someone might have questions when the Good Side is keeping a lot of secrets. The hand-wave for all of this is, again, that you've lost your memories; it doesn't matter who you were, only who you are now... but who you are now is a game protagonist on a railroad plot, which sure isn't satisfying. Not helping things is the constant allusion to some grand mythos that is never actually explained. What are the Blades of Elysium, the Life Thread, and the concept of a soul that are all so integral to the story? Everybody seems to know except the player.\n\nAll in all, the game is mechanically good, but there's too much story sprinkled in for mechanics to carry the game. The story that exists feels half-baked, a setting with flat characters and incomplete history that is full of holes that nobody acknowledges. I beat the game, but I did not enjoy it. I stopped caring about the characters and the story, including the clich\u00e9 (and Purple-Prose-filled) ending. I was just staring at my screen, mashing buttons and hoping for a few rare drops before the plot ran out.\n\nOh, and the final boss is a joke if you've fully leveled up and spent some money in the shop for equipment.

I'm afraid of things in the dark\". Voice acting, particularly in a small calibre title such as Dust, is a rarity and always a pleasure to discover. The moody yet courageous tones complement Dust's prowess whilst the high-pitched fourth-wall breaks of the ever so sarcastic Fidget grants his sidekick with plenty of personality. The lines of dialogue throughout is undoubtedly a high selling point for the game, with each side quest offering hilarious quotes that'll have the player laughing at the screen. Plus, it produces characterisation for each character, and the end result is an enjoyable and memorable time.\n+ This \"Elysian Tail\" is a difficult quest, to which every level gained grants the player an incredibly important stat boost that they must choose wisely to upgrade. Whether it's adding to Dust's strength, life force, defence or Fidget's chaotic secondary power that fills the screen up with so much intensity and so much death, each advancement to one of the four listed attributes changes the game immensely. Consequently, this offers a strategy when building Dust up as a character, whilst keeping the sense of progression intact. \n+ Forests, caves and dilapidated churches. Each backdrop of the branching world were illustrated to perfection. Plenty of detail to spice up the world and appeal to the characterised visuals.\n\nWHAT I DISLIKED:\n- The user interface was dreadful. For starters, the title screen resembled a standard mediocre 'RPG Maker' game that had a font style which inadvertently juxtaposed the backdrop. However it was the menu system itself that was tediously cumbersome to navigate. Food items are of paramount importance in Dust, but in order to digest them they need to be equipped into the quick slot before being consumed. The map system was as basic as they come, mimicking 'Metroid's' blue squared notation. The quest log was insufficient, supplying minimal details. Crafting remained redundant with high item drop rates from enemies that never instigated fulfilling a blueprint. And basic menu navigation was mostly unsatisfying. It never matched the quality of the in-game mechanics.\n- Areas comprised of sections. These ranged from minuscule two-sectioned areas to sprawling twenty-or-so-sectioned areas all interconnected by a world map. These larger areas were so vast, that they quickly became tedious to navigate. Spending two hours in the same area to unlock a chest or two never felt rewarding or satisfying. The lack of an intuitive fast travelling system, aside from a crystal that teleports the player out of an area and back to the world map, hindered the standard \"metroidvania\" progressional exploration. It never once motivated me to venture back to previous areas to discover all of its secrets.\n- The hack'n'slash combat was unbalanced. Initially, Dust slashing his sword through enemies felt satisfying and required player intuition to quickly dodge enemy attacks. Shortly after completing the first area, Fidget becomes stronger and more reliable as a gameplay mechanic. This leads to the player spinning through the level while shooting millions of projectiles in every direction, obliterating all of the enemies on screen. It instantly becomes mundane and far too excessive. Attempting to maintain combos are essentially relinquished due to the chaos that rapidly ensues, which is an integral aspect to any hack'n'slash style.\n- The boss battles were a huge letdown, and gauged little to no challenge...\n\nVERDICT:\n4/10 \"flying weasels\"\n\nP.S. Dean Dodrill has obviously crafted a well-loved game, and the fact it was independently developed will always be appreciative.

I played it a small amount there, before I lost the xbox, and remember absolutely nothing about it. I bought it again on steam more recently to give it another chance, but I had just barely made it to the first village when I couldn't go any further. Personally, the character designs and backgrounds and music were decent to actually beautiful, but it wasn't enough to cover up the many glaring issues that the game has poking out.\n\n-The character's voices are overly stereotypical or annoying to the point where I was skipping the dialogue, which wasn't an issue because:\n-The map is just as linear as the new pokemon games, so there's absolutely no need to even bother with any of the plot, since it's just paved out for you in the gameplay.\n-The plot is as bland as boiled chicken. A husky-voiced, face-hiding, backhand-wielding \"swordmaster\" wakes up with amnesia, and not only does he does he have amnesia, but he's got BOTH a talking sword, and a squeaky-voiced, small, flying companion.\n-You get handheld harder than a 5 year old in a supermarket. You can't save your points without the game constantly poking you to spend them immediately (which force you to become a generalist anyways, so what's the point in even giving us dedicated skill points if you're just going to lock us out of desired choices anyways?), along with the skills that are just given to you as a reward for walking and pressing X and Y randomly.\n-Speaking of the combat, there's absolutely no reason to have any combos on the ground after you get the combos and abilities to fight in the air. Once I got the X-Y air combo and the aerial dash, I hardly ever even took advantage of Dust's legs. It was broken to the point that jumping led you to an almost invincible state, where the *only* enemy that could hurt you were the slimes (which, when I first encountered them, they didn't even foreshadow their attack, and immediately spiked me from underneath).\n-It's either painfully obvious, or almost impossible to tell when you take damage. Most of the time, you get hit when there are a metric ton of animations and details on screen, so it's difficult to see your own character turning red (a red vignette would've made it much more obvious). Other times, you try to parry, and even when it seems like it should be perfectly timed, the game smacks you in the face (what's the purpose of having a tutorial for parrying if you get the opportunity to do so more than enough times beforehand?).\n\nI *tried* giving this game more time than I did, but there was no reason for me to. I had no desire to, I wasn't feeling a connection to any of the characters, and the level layouts were too cut and dry for me. It's not fun playing a game where you don't even *want* to listen to the characters, or where you don't *want* to go through the same level-creator-esque areas.

Metroidvania sencillito que mezcla acci\u00f3n y exploraci\u00f3n de una manera destacable, no inventa nada ni tampoco es especialmente bueno en esas facetas pero el resultado es positivo y cualquiera lo puede comprobar. Dudo que alguien que pruebe Dust no quiera seguir jug\u00e1ndolo porque es asequible, adictivo y est\u00e1 bien hecho.\nDust es el prota y aparece en medio de un bosque amn\u00e9sico y acompa\u00f1ado de una espada parlante y la guardiana de \u00e9sta, Fidget. Los tres juntos deb\u00e9is hacer frente a los diversos problemas de la regi\u00f3n mientras vas descubriendo qui\u00e9n es el prota, algo que llevar\u00e1 alguna sorpresilla aunque nada especialmente original. Con esa premisa empiezas a explorar el bonito mundo hecho a mano que est\u00e1 a tu disposici\u00f3n, conocer\u00e1s gente, los ayudar\u00e1s y finalmente comenzar\u00e1 la trama final del juego que desemboca en un final bastante espectacular aunque previsible. Muy buen trabajo de este hombre y aqu\u00ed dejo mi recomendaci\u00f3n pero no sin antes mencionar sus cosas malas, que las tiene. Por descarte, todo lo que no diga ser\u00e1 bueno como por ejemplo el aspecto visual y la m\u00fasica que son muy chulos.\nLo malo:\n-Es muy f\u00e1cil, pero mucho. Lo jugu\u00e9 en la m\u00e1xima dificultad y mor\u00ed 2 veces o quiz\u00e1 3, no recuerdo. El prota es tan bestia en combate que es imparable, eso s\u00ed, al menos por jugarlo en dif\u00edcil pasaba algo y es que el da\u00f1o recibido es enorme pero de todas formas sigue siendo muy f\u00e1cil.\n-La historia est\u00e1 bien, te pica la curiosidad y todo eso pero han querido ser graciosos usando a Fidget y como mucho el juego es simp\u00e1tico, tiene un humor muy plano e infantil.\n-El sistema de combate es muy chulo pero es ca\u00f3tico, te mueves tan r\u00e1pido y se llena todo tanto de luces y cosas que a menudo pierdes la ubicaci\u00f3n del personaje. Y a veces, en la parte final, confundes al prota con NPC's y enemigos porque hay muchos en pantalla y tienen un aspecto parecido.\n-El control es deficiente, manejar a Dust cuesta bastante por imprecisi\u00f3n en el mando, no siempre responde a lo que pulsas, los saltos son muy falsos y dif\u00edciles de controlar,... no es horrible en absoluto, te acostumbras, pero no ha quedado bien este aspecto.\n-El sistema de impactos tambi\u00e9n es un poco fall\u00f3n, muchas veces atacar\u00e1s a alguien y no le har\u00e1s da\u00f1o porque... s\u00ed, porque es evidente que has acertado el golpe. Lo mismo pasa con las trampas, a veces las tocas y traspasas claramente y no te hacen da\u00f1o, otras veces solo con acercarte te da\u00f1an, en fin.\n-Lo peor de todo, y ya para acabar, es algo que s\u00ed es grave y es un bug que afecta a la interacci\u00f3n con el mundo. Para hablar con la gente, guardar partida, entrar en sitios y comerciar debes pulsar Arriba, adem\u00e1s Fidget te lo marca siempre. Pero claro, hay un fallo muy gordo en esto y es que tras jugar un ratito (y a veces ya est\u00e1 bugueado seg\u00fan empiezas a jugar) notar\u00e1s que cuando pasas al lado de algo con el que sabes que puedes interaccionar, Fidget no dice nada y luego ves que no puedes hablar, guardar partida, etc... Lo de hablar con la gente no suele estropearse pero lo dem\u00e1s s\u00ed de modo que si quieres salvar partida no puedes, si quieres abrir un cofre no puedes y as\u00ed con todo. Lo bueno es que, de alguna manera, se arregla solo pero luego vuelve a fallar. Esto da mucha rabia e inseguridad porque quiz\u00e1 solo quieres jugar media hora y si quieres dejarlo no puedes porque no te permita guardar y tal vez debas esperar 10 minutos a que se arregle. Un fallo brutal, molesto y absurdo aunque he visto gameplays por ah\u00ed y no les pasaba eso, o sea que tal vez solo me pase a m\u00ed pero en cualquier caso hizo que una buena experiencia fuese bastante disminuida por algo as\u00ed.\n\nResumiendo, muy buen juego, muy recomendable pero tiene sus pegas y ninguna es relevante salvo lo del bug de las interacciones con el entorno, algo que para m\u00ed le baja muchos puntos, pero muchos. No obstante, es un juego digno de ser probado por todo el mundo.\n\nNota: 6,5", "timestamp_created": 1596126468, "timestamp_updated": 1597267898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73496422": {"recommendationid": "73496422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327251505", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 972, "last_played": 1595836940}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like a good story: Don't buy this\n\nIf you like especially good music: Don't buy this.\n\nIf you like excellent combat with tight controlls!: Don't buy this.\n\nIf you like Metroidvanias: Don't buy this.\n\nThe reviews have an \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating so I had to try it since Metroidvanias are my favorite genre. \nIn short it does not feel like a Metroidvania game, all powers are handed to you as you progress through the story.

I gave it a fair chance. At this point I'd rather replay any game that is actually good than continue on.\n\nThe Good\nThe art and music are really good to excellent.\nThe voice acting is good, the characters are cute and interesting.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI played it on tough difficulty. Most enemies barely attack you, they are just there to absorb damage and slow you down. Then you come to enemies that your sword cannot kill, and you have to use Fidget's magic ability, which I never bothered to level up or use. So it took forever to kill these. So now I'm leveling up an ability I don't even like or use to get past once specific enemy.\n\nThe combat is mostly boring and easy until they sneak in an enemy that actually can hurt you. But it's hard to see their attacks because the screen is cluttered with damage sponges and the mostly worthless loot they drop.\n\nThe controls are weird (you use the right thumbstick to dodge), and you can't remap them.\n\nThe platforming is below average at best. Most ledges end before the shown edge, so if you try to jump from the very edge, you'll fall off the ledge. So far there's no wall jumping (except in designed areas), no double jumps...there's nothing interesting about how your character moves or what you can do.\n\nThere are some off limit areas and you do get abilities that allow you to access them later, but backtracking is a chore because each area pretty much looks the same with no platforming or traversal variety. I would not call this a Metroidvania (my favorite genre).\n\nThe secrets get pretty boring fast. You either slash through a wall or guide a flower bomb to a wall...over and over and over again.\n\nDust isn't a bad game, but beyond the art, music, and voice acting, everything else is mediocre.", "timestamp_created": 1595485553, "timestamp_updated": 1595485553, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460076063871383667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73139280": {"recommendationid": "73139280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027958815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1595469210}, "language": "english", "review": "nom", "timestamp_created": 1595467876, "timestamp_updated": 1595467876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73123345": {"recommendationid": "73123345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113610453", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 809, "last_played": 1413239428}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly a hidden gem.

I played it when I was younger but never completed it so when I saw it was on sale I bought it and played it since I rememberd having a good time. \n\nFirst of. This game is absolutely gorgeous with it's graphics and areas. It stood out immedietly and it's such a treat to just look at. Also the attention to detail in most areas is incredibly well done and it made the background even prettier. The animations for the most parts are solid and amazingly done. Some could use a bit of extra love, same goes with the animated cutscenes, but for the most parts they were awesome.\n\n The game do lack in some elements, mainly the side characters. They're pretty much your standard: \"Hey, I need this but can't or won't get it myself\" kinda deal. But that didn't bother me since the voice acting in this game for the majority of the characters are absolutly amazing. Some scenes will look weird due to the mix-match of 2d and 3d graphics but they're are far inbetween. \n\nThe games overall story was intresting but it didn't quite \"catch me\" until the very end. However! The gameplay was extremly fun and not to challening to someone who's not famililar with the hack-n-slash genre of games.  \n\nThere was a few things I would personally change to make the game a lot more enjoyable mainly: SPOILERS!!! \n\nThe ghost mansion missions. they we're so boring and didn't add much to the overall experience except dragging it out. same repetative shit over and over 4 times.

Maybe only because furries are the main audience and there are few games targeted at us?\n\nArt style is cute and kinda pretty at times.  Odd rainbow/glowing vines detract from the aesthetic in many areas.\nFidget is adorable.\nVoice acting is good.\nStory is so-so.  Villain is one-dimensional and lacks motivation.  Dust's reactions to things are often simplistic and unrealistic.\n\nIt falls flat as a Metroidvania with only 4 skills and 2 additional fidget-weapon types to learn, each of them generic.  I found it frustrating that all skills were \"learned\" by touching a generic glowing ball with no attempt at explaining why the ball would grant abilities at all, especially supernatural abilities.  Balls rarely had guardians and felt carelessly thrown in almost randomly.\n\nI love Metroidvanias and exploration, but with Dust I never had the 'that's really cool' experience of using a creative skill or finding secrets.  I explored 100% of the map and treasures but it felt more like a chore than an exploration.\n\nIt had a couple of decent puzzles.  I found a lot of puzzles/secrets were more frustrating than satisfactory to obtain because they required long periods of running, waiting on a platform, or spamming a certain button in a way that made it unclear if that was the intended solution.  One secret required matching a symbol on an object in inventory to something in the game, but the symbol in inventory was so faint I never realized what it was.  That was one of two puzzles I had to look up the solution to.  Both involved crouching for ~10 secs in certain locations and don't ask me how you're supposed to know that crouching for a long time will activate something.\n\nThere's also a janky method of using wind attack to fly to the top of almost any level by moving left and right through enemies.  I can't decide if it's a bug or intentional, but there are some secrets that can be obtained using it.  The intended way to get many (maybe all?) of those secrets is using skills acquired near the end of the game.\n\nIn one case I got a key using janky air rise before I should have been able to reach it and the game didn't count my obtaining it.  Now I'm missing 3% of the treasure on Blackmoor Mountains so I can never reach 100%.  I checked a video and two forums to make sure I wasn't missing a treasure other than the key.\n\nCombat was mindless on Normal difficulty after the first 30-60 mins.  You just spam Fidget's attack plus wind attack.  It even works on all bosses, including the final one.  On rare occasion you must cure Fidget's silenced status during a boss fight using an item in the pause menu.  There are about 10 instances of an enemy you must parry once before spamming.  If you avoid the spam and fight with jumps and slashes, maybe combat is more satisfying, but personally I found it hard to keep track of where Dust was within swarms of enemies.  Regularly fighting 5-20 enemies at once gives a sense of feeling overpowered and goes with the theme of Dust being \"able to fight an army\", but I lost interest in that pretty quickly and found combat to be boring and repetitive after a little while.\n\nConversations started strong with additional dialog after repeated talks, but later people had less and less to say and the second half of the game felt rushed with little conversation.\n\nThe game is impressive for being mostly created by one person, but then again so was Axiom Verge and Axiom was many times more impressive and fun.  Fans of furry characters may enjoy it simply for the aesthetics but in all other aspects I can't say it felt worth my time.\n\nIf you do play, set \"Portrait Quality: High\" in Settings or you will notice pixelation/artifacting in the linework when characters talk to each other.", "timestamp_created": 1590712206, "timestamp_updated": 1590712206, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434679090976715088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69963089": {"recommendationid": "69963089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030181123", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1327, "last_played": 1590702188}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very easy recommend.

The art style and music were good. It reminded me a lot of Sega Saturn style RPGs. The leveling up system and story were both more of a sideways thumb for me. You have to basically have at least a single point in everything to progress. So while you can \"max\" one stat, you can't leave the other stats behind. You end up with the joke of putting a point into everything.  The down points were the tediousness of combat and an unnecessary crafting system. The combat was essentially just a few buttons to mash, or throw in magic on the occasion. There weren't any layers too it. The crafting system was a waste of time. You either find what you're looking for, can buy it, or you don't need it. I never even found one of the items necessary to make the \"best\" items in the game.

I think as a project by one person, it's really quite an accomplishment. Comparing it to other Metroidvania games, it just doesn't hold up. In the end, I wouldn't tell a friend to play it. I'll run through points for and against.\n\nFor the good parts, I thought the backgrounds, attack animations, and general art style were all on point. The style of the animal characters is a bit weird, but I think it works for this game to make it stand out. Most of the time, the combat feels pretty satisfying as you mindlessly cleave through waves of enemies. The story was pretty decent as well.\n\nNow, for the complaints. The combat overall is very simplistic, and it's basically just a button masher. You do the same few attacks constantly, spam magic, rinse and repeat. Towards the end, failing to constantly mash attack meant I would miss parry windows, or just miss with my attacks completely. For the majority of the game, you feel unstoppable, but near the end the enemies hit ridiculously hard and it's basically just luck as to whether you hit your counter or lose half your life. In general, your character feels sluggish and imprecise. Platforming can be quite a pain, especially where things like spikes or lava are concerned, because health does not come back and you always need to use healing items. I felt like enemies dropped a completely pitiful amount of gold for the amount you'll have to spend on food to heal yourself. For the final boss I basically spent my entire game's savings on food and it was barely enough. This makes me think you're meant to grind to be higher level, which I was not willing to do (finished at lvl 32 I think). People point to the voice acting as a high point, but honestly most of it was so cringe-worthy. The orange bat-thing, Fidget, is particularly annoying; the main character, Dust, is not much better, sounding like a moody anime teen while trying to deliver these serious lines. Some of the supporting cast did a good job, but the characters I need to listen to constantly really started to grate on me. Also, while I understand the limited art budget, I felt like the cutscenes were a particular step down from the rest of the game's look; they seriously look like they're done in MS Paint. I think that was a missed opportunity to lean in to the painted art style of other parts of the game. \n\nLooking at the size of the positives vs. negatives, I guess it really was more a negative review. Still, it kept me playing through to the end, for what it's worth. There was fun to be had in exploring around and slashing bad guys, but then there would always be something to annoy me (there were plenty more things I didn't remember to mention). I guess I was hoping for more payout, because the end was tedious and very frustrating to play. The end boss has like 4 phases!

You might like the story if you're young - I probably would have in like 6th grade.\n\nThis game has a very colorful and unique art style and very fun gameplay. I don't know how many beat-em-up metroidvanias exist, but I've never heard of another one. Stringing together attacks and zooming around the screen with the aerial right click was very satisfying, as was collecting loot and exploring. The music is fine (with the exception of the cutscenes, which I thought were scored very well), but not memorable.\n\nHowever, if you're like me and you really value story/writing, I absolutely don't recommend this game. The characters are pretty flat, the game's emotional beats seem cheap and not set-up, and there is barely any lore or backstory to most characters. Writing-wise, most things are very cheesy/overdramatic, with the exception of Fidget [spoiler] and her relationship with Dust [/spoiler] (she was over-the-top and didn't really have an arc, but I liked her dialogue). I believe I did about half of the sidequests before finishing the game and didn't get much out of it there either. Click the spoiler tags below if you want a full rant about why I really disliked the story.\n\n[spoiler] Emotional beats with no set up: BoPo's dad dying, Cora's reuniting with her husband, Gaius's death. When BoPo's dad died, my only emotional reaction was from the fact that a child was losing his father, not that this character I know/love is losing someone close to him. That felt cheap - I had barely interacted with BoPo so I didn't really care on a personal level. The same goes for Cora - I was a bit sad/happy, but I barely knew either of the characters at all. From the way the other characters react, I felt like these were going for a bigger emotional reaction that just fell flat. And I'm the type who cried for like 2 hours straight after finishing To The Moon.  [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Besides those two, I felt like Gaius was poorly written. By his design and dialogue it seemed like they were trying to make him seem non-threatening to make you doubt yourself? But his character never hit for one reason: WHY WAS HE TRYING TO KILL THE MOONBLOODS???? Not ONCE did Dust/anyone ever try to convince him through any method besides \"Stop or I'll kill you!\". I was just waiting the entire climax for Dust to ask Gaius why he wanted to commit genocide and expected something like \"They killed my family!\" if they were going for more morally grey or at the very least \"They are inferior/cause trouble/racism!\" if they just wanted him to be the big bad. Gaius has absolutely no motivation to kill the moonbloods, unless this was hidden in some obscure place (which it shouldn't be, as it's the main villain's motivation???). He has no backstory besides \"he was friends with Cassius\", either. This all came to a head in the final scene, where he kills himself for no apparent reason, and we're supposed to feel sad about it, judging by the animation and the music. Except, I literally know nothing about this guy except he was friends with Cassius, who was evil, and that he wants to commit genocide for shits and giggles I guess. And then he gets a slow motion \"Nooooo!\" death scene? Come on.  [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Another general bad thing they did were the themes. I saw two attempted themes: Dust's identity and \"Sometimes your best isn't enough\". Dust's identity was alright, but I feel like it could have permeated the game much more. There was literally no hint of Cassius's personality in Dust until the very last scene, which is just cheap and majorly weakens the theme. As for the second theme, it's only brought up twice: when BoPo's dad dies and the very end. The first time I was like \"ok, let's see where they go with this, maybe this can be Fidget's character arc.\" Except it really wasn't, it went nowhere, as did Fidget as a character. They just brought it up at the very end like \"Heyy! It's a theme! Look! It came up twice!!\".  [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Finally, there are also some inexplicable or lazy story points. It's kind of weird Dust basically just beat the shit out of people until they agreed with him twice? And those were the main two middle story beats. The water lady said she was under some supernatural \"darkness\" that was never explained. Unless the \"darkness\" was actually her desire for revenge and not a supernatural thing, in which case Dust literally just beat her up until she changed her mind. In any case, it made no sense. The Kane ghost was never explained, nor was the Kane demon, nor was the Flameless Light or whatever. There is minimal thought put into the world, it doesn't operate under a set of rules, etc. For example, Aurora is shocked by an attack from below, and show no knowledge of the Po people living beneath them - it would be obvious they should ask the Pos what happened, so they must not know of there existence, right? But Dust/Fidget don't seem surprised by the Pos, nor do they ask for an explanation of like their race, so they're probably some known entity? But also the Pos know the surface-dwellers exist, as they reference their dislike of them a lot. That implies that there have been altercations between them before, yet Aurorans don't seem to know they exist.\nAnyways. \ntldr; writing bad.

Came back to it now in 2020 because of the lockdown and because my system can only support low graphics games and I had an absolute blast. There is a satisfying gameplay loop of hack and slash combat, looting enemies and exploring and platforming for hidden areas, all to collect resources for crafting more gear. Plenty of side-quests, a lovely hand drawn world backed by a beautiful soundtrack, a really nice story that while remaining kid friendly has its fair share of powerful moments. The combat is extremely satisfying and platforming is fairly fun, controls are good can't really find any faults. Surprised by how enjoyable it was as a whole. There are some nice nods to other indie games as well if you're into that kinda stuff.\n\nOn the negative side the sidekick might be an annoying character to some players but thankfully the game is generous with letting you button mash to skip through lines or just skip dialog sections entirely, though personally (surprisingly) I actually found it quite endearing. Some tiny annoyances like parrying an enemy sometimes throws you back into environmental hazards but those are nitpicks really. The difficulty can also be weird, on tough difficulty it's quite hard at the start of each chapter, but after gaining a few levels and finding or crafting some updated gear the rest of the chapter quickly becomes a cakewalk only for it to become hard again at the start of the next chapter. You will easily start to one shot enemies in previous areas and always have a surplus of resources. Which can either make you feel powerful like you play really well or bored like it lacks a challenge, you know what kind of player you are. An option for scalable enemies might have been nice I guess, but it didn't take away from my experience. Negatives are few and far between really.\n\nSurprisingly polished and captivating game and can only imagine the amount of work the developer put into this. Will have fond memories of this. That world map music is blissful \\m/\n\n[b]Verdict: A must play for fans of Indie games, Metroidvanias & RPGs.

You travel the landscape in a 2D side scrolling platforming RPG taking on side quests to help the folks of Aurora, Mudtop, and other villages as you aim to complete your overarching quest...to find and defeat General Gaius.\n\nThe storyline is interesting as you learn more about who you are, the voice acting is generally well done, and the graphics are cute, not extremely detailed, but fit the genre and the storyline just fine.  The music and the sound effects are good, but nothing to write home about.  The action is fairly free flowing.  You have your usual combos that give you different attacks and finishing moves as well as increased access to abilities for both you and your sidekick to help you deal with an ever increasing difficult enemy to defeat.  Different levels take you to different style of scenery from the great outdoors to dark caves and snow filled mountaintops.\n\nI found this game to be engaging and rather fun.  The abilities really add to the game not only for the metroidvania style of gaming, but for the attacks on your enemies as well.  I still can't believe this was made entirely, save the music and voice overs, by one person.  What an achievement for sure!  If you like metroidvania type game, this has it all: storyline, action, quests, things to collect, and it all comes together rather well.  I would definitely recommend this for those that enjoy a good game, just know that in my play through I played on normal and while I did die a few times, I didn't find it too difficult.

tiene una hermosa ambientaci\u00f3n, mientras juegas de vez en cuando hay cambio de clima que le da un poco mas de vida al juego (Aunque a veces puede ser un poco molesto para los ojos los rayos de la tormenta), una hermosa banda sonora, muchos enemigos interesantes, su historia es muy interesante (tal vez no sea una gran historia o la mejor que hayas le\u00eddo pero una vez que lo empiezas te dan ganas de seguir hasta saber que esta pasando realmente, al menos a mi me atrapo), y si eres una persona algo sensible en ocasiones te llevar\u00e1s un Crash en el kokoro.\n\nDust es un misterioso \"chico\" que a perdido la memoria, se encuentra una espada parlante y a su guardiana Fidget una criaturita adorable con aspecto dulce (pero no te dejes enga\u00f1ar por su apariencia en verdad es un poco bocazas y atrevida pero le da un toque divertidisimo a la trama)\n\nUna recomendaci\u00f3n a todo aquel que compre el juego, como muchos juegos este no es perfecto y a veces se puede volver un poco loco XD, as\u00ed que recomiendo guardar lo mas seguido posible y en varios apartados (a mi me crasheo varias veces pero mi PC es un poco especialito as\u00ed que quiz\u00e1s a los que lo compren no les pase nada, pero por las dudas mejor avisar), tambi\u00e9n advertir que en ocasiones el juego no detecta los \"c\u00edrculos de guardado\" y ni guarda autimatico ni puedes guardar manualmente, as\u00ed pues cuidadito, para solucionarlo normalmente basta con cambiar de una zona a otra, pero aseg\u00farate de guardar siempre que puedas por estos 2 bugs (no se si son bugs que pasa normalmente o solo con algunos PC\u00b4S pero por si acaso os prevengo)\n\nEn definitiva es un buen juego para pasar unas horas bien entretenido, adem\u00e1s en rebajas sale baratito, as\u00ed que dale una

While Sony wasn\u2019t too keen on pursuing indie titles, Microsoft was more than willing to invest money into indie games like this one.\nDust: An Elysian Tail was one of the best indie games back on Xbox 360 but, a few years after it was released, it was like \u201cPOOF\u201d and everyone stopped talking about it. People still talked about Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/\n and other Indies but it seems that the Dust (HAR HAR) has settled.\n\nActually, the last time, before playing this, I heard someone mention Dust was when Mighty No. 9\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/314710/Mighty_No_9/\n came out because people kept comparing Mighty No. 9 to Dust saying how dust had a 1-man-team, less money and was made much better than Mighty No. 9.\n\nI had never played Dust: An Elysian Tail before despite owning an Xbox 360 and loads of indie games, so I was excited. While the game was a bit bumpy, I can safely say that Dust: An Elysian Tail is still a good game, even years later. Good but not great.\n\n[h1] Deadly samurai in action complete with a talking sword and a cute flying companion [/h1]\n\nOn the surface, Dust: An Elysian Tail is a beautiful, hand-drawn, 2D,  metroidvania/hack-and-slash game made by a single person. Love and care ooze through this game but it doesn\u2019t hit all it\u2019s marks.\n\nThe game opens up with our mysterious protagonist, an anthropomorphic cat(?) (maybe fox?) with the skills of a ninja/samurai. Dust is awoken by a cute, yet slightly irritating flying critter named Fidget and a talking sword. Dust can\u2019t remember who he is or what he has done but the sword explains that he has a role to play and Fidget decides to follow him. What transpires is a rather good story with a few surprise twists along the way. The story itself is what kept me playing until the end.\n\n[h1] Fighting over exploration and platforming [/h1]\n\nLet\u2019s start with the things I didn\u2019t like first: \n\nDust is a metroidvania game but it often forgets that. You will gain some abilities that will change how you navigate through the world slightly and will have to backtrack just like in most metroidvania games. Despite this, I often forgot that I was even playing  a metroidvania since the main focus of this game is the combat. While you will have to navigate loads of grid-like map screens, you will usually be fighting on each map screen.\n\nFighting in this game is very fast, fluid, satisfying, fun and looks incredible\u2026 at first. After a few hours with the game, you realize that you had seen everything when it comes to fighting. The game never does much to improve the combat beyond what you initially start with. Sure, you will learn a few new abilities and a few spells, but it largely remains the same from your first battle to your last one. It looks cool, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it\u2019s just like watching the same action film sequence for the 20th time. Each time it looks a little less cool.\n\n[h1] Enemies don't stand a chance against Dust [/h1]\n\nCombat difficulty is also an issue. Enemies don\u2019t hurt you when you walk into them, however, they do loads of damage when they hit you. That is\u2026 if they can land a hit. You see, Dust: An Elysian Tail wants you to feel like an indestructible ninja God that mows down enemies and it does this really well. You only have a light and a heavy attack and handful of combos plus a few spells and you really don\u2019t need anything else to absolutely destroy everything on the screen. Not even a 100 enemies can stand in your way. The game tries to balance this out by having Dust be very vulnerable (it takes only a few hits to bring him down) but that\u2019s really hard when you consider how fast and powerful Dust\u2019s attacks are. Like I said, it gets old really fast and I found myself just mashing buttons or running past enemies during my last few hours with the game. So, in other words, Dust: An Elysian Tail plays very much like a 2D Dynasty Warriors \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/278080/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_8_Xtreme_Legends_Complete_Edition/  \ngame... which isn't necessarily bad.\n\n[h1] The nice story and beautiful presentation save the game [/h1]\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the things I really liked:\n\n The graphics are beautiful. Dust, the environment and all other characters look like Anime-styled characters. Even the pause menu screen is breathtaking (seriously, pause the game if you get it and tell me if you have ever seen a more beautiful pause menu).  The characters are voice acted beautifully, every single character.\n\n Dust and Fidget are really likeable characters and I genuinely wanted to see them succeed in their quest.  The game is short but offers loads of replayablity with its metroidvania styled gameplay.\n\nThe game has lots of interesting side-quests and challenges.\n\nThe game, while monotonous, is still fun to play.\n\n[h1] More good than bad [/h1]\n\nOverall, when it comes to good vs. bad, honestly, the scale shifts back and forth. On one hand, you have a beautiful looking game, with a great story and, at first, fun combat.\n\nOn the other hand, the combat gets stale rather fast and you end up hating the game to a point where you just want to either finish or get bored enough to quit playing it. \n\nI\u2019m happy I was able to make it to the end of the game as the ending was very satisfying. \n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is a good game. If you are in the mood for a beautiful metroidvania-lite game with cool, but kind-of boring combat, you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\nNext game: Dustforce\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075061111/recommended/65300/\n\n[h3]If you liked my review, feel free to follow my curator group.

The game certainly has a linear feel to it, even if some previous areas can be revisited and poked at with any new abilities to find things of worth. Mostly those items are equipable weapons or armor, which... you know. The mileage you get out of those items are up to your play style.\n\nThe story follows a chapter-based progression, and after the introductory chapter you have access to a world map where you can access \"levels\" to start. So it's not a single, unbroken map like, say, Hollow Knight or Super Metroid or Castlevania SotN. Some of those chapters put you in situations where you cannot easily return to the main map until you progress further in, which might limit some options or force you to grind for gold and Exp.\nThe combat can be simplistic, and sometimes can even get to the point of being button-mashing-y. Single encounters with foes can help with learning their timing and knowing when's the right moment to set up a parry and then strike back while the foe is stunned. With encounters against multiple foes at once, you'll want to trust in a combination of your alternate and primary attacks. The timing is key otherwise you can find yourself in deep trouble really quickly.\n\nAs for the enemies... There's a basic variety of them, with some requiring more tact in order to overcome them. On higher difficulties, expect their attacks to go from \"death by a thousand cuts\" to \"death by a hundred spiked clubs\". Really recommend starting at a lower level, playing through the game at least once, and then restarting with a higher difficulty.\n\nHighly recommend for casual gamers and game design students.

A group of five enemies appears and you spam two or three combos. Repeat this forever. Sometimes I wish there were less enemies and more platform action. Most of these enemies won't die by the first hit. There is this particular movement that makes you fly and it is overpowered. It is a boss killer and can make you fly 30 meters in the air (why?).\n\nItem shopping and creation is redundant. They should have chosen one the systems. Sometimes you can a super armor which renders useless all items in shop. Why so many items. I didn't get to use most of them.\n\nMaps are way too big. It's partly a walking simulator, but overflowed with enemies. Even the towns are big. Walk hundreds of screens, again and again. This is particularly the worst error, since it delays the game and makes it artificially longer, and boring.\n\nSometimes the map has traps so it can throw you back to the ground. This resembles very old videogames which made you repeat long sections of platforms. Maybe the developer had some influence on old unfair videogames.\n\nSome puzzles are very arbitrary. There is one where you need an explosive pineaaple, but you cannot take the one that it's near, since it has a countdown of 3. You have to use it to open a passage and get a second pineapple with a countdown of 10. This is ridiculous, because it forces the player to make a detour. Why not make the first pineapple to have a countdown of 10? To annoy the player and make him do EXACTLY as the developer planned. Why not plan something more logic?\n\nPoison and fire burns are some other mechanics that would have been better left out. At least with poison there is plenty of heal from drops. But you need to buy icecream for the fireburns and you only have one slot for a quick item, which should always be a healing one with a lot of stock. Instead, you have twenty different healing items. This abundance is actually annoying.\n\nI lost interest on the sidequests and centered on the main story. But it has a slow development and a revelation that stands as very trivial.  It's as if you were being used. \n\nCutscenes are kind of modest. It would have been better to use the game engine.\n\nThere is a tremendous amount of filler dialogs. You can even skip most of the dialog windows and you will still understand what is going on. This is the trademark of filler.\n\nStory is like: [spoiler]help village, kill boss, help underground village, kill boss, help grandma (WHY), kill boss, get to village, lead LONG charge, kill final boss[/spoiler].\n\nBosses are cheese with the flying attack.\n\nFinal enemy is a nuissance: four phases on four different maps.", "timestamp_created": 1583954817, "timestamp_updated": 1583955946, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461103469133377075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64727781": {"recommendationid": "64727781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355246036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2269, "last_played": 1641242201}, "language": "english", "review": "it has an amazing story to tell while also being very dungeon crawly. over all loved it!", "timestamp_created": 1583698046, "timestamp_updated": 1583698046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64720737": {"recommendationid": "64720737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328942170", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1583687333}, "language": "english", "review": "i'm into metroidvania but this is very boring to me.\nI don't know maybe it's me but i really don't get all this enthusiastic review.\nIt looks like a mobile game and also it feels like it, the combat is boring and messy, most of the time it's enough to push buttons as fast as you can.\nReally boring, got tired after half an hour.", "timestamp_created": 1583688527, "timestamp_updated": 1583688527, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478995531797409058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64687026": {"recommendationid": "64687026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416528906", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 961, "last_played": 1583642176}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy buen juego un historia simple  y emotiva al final, buen el sistema de combos que con la magia de tu acompa\u00f1ante  y un sistema de parada contrataque que si lo manejas bien revientas el juego, lo que si para alguien con experiencia puede resultar un poco facil, pero mas  alla de eso un juego estupendo.", "timestamp_created": 1583642647, "timestamp_updated": 1583642647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64649415": {"recommendationid": "64649415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020050223", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3446, "last_played": 1589674539}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun li'l platformer set in a world full of furries.

Its a high quality game all around.\n\nDefinitely worth a buy.", "timestamp_created": 1582925234, "timestamp_updated": 1582925234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64200668": {"recommendationid": "64200668", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999597603", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 401, "last_played": 1401636618}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful story, interesting game play and beautiful scenery.", "timestamp_created": 1582819052, "timestamp_updated": 1582819052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64074187": {"recommendationid": "64074187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023666926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1752, "playtime_forever": 799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1642008289}, "language": "english", "review": "It's amazing that this game was made by one person, is so good and have great port.\u00a0", "timestamp_created": 1582594787, "timestamp_updated": 1582594787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64068808": {"recommendationid": "64068808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044821157", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 946, "last_played": 1582586727}, "language": "english", "review": "A truly enjoyable +15h game!\n9/10 gameplay with a great learning curve\n11/10 DeviantArt fur on point kinda stuff, if you like that, if not you can just ignore it.\n\nPlayed on 2020 for reference", "timestamp_created": 1582583854, "timestamp_updated": 1582584057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64016581": {"recommendationid": "64016581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025674597", "num_games_owned": 2020, "num_reviews": 587, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1148, "last_played": 1582486817}, "language": "english", "review": "Dust: An Elysian Tail is a fantastic metroidvania set in a world of antropomorphic animals, with a great story that manages to have a few emotional moments, as well as great action.\n\nThe game begins with your character, Dust, waking up in the middle of a forest, with no memory of his past, and having summoned a magical sword, the sword of Ahrah. He's also joined by the guardian of the sword, a nimbat (a small flying creature) named Fidget. Hoping to find answers about his past, he embarks on a quest to help the people of this world.\n\nThe game plays like a traditional 2D metroidvania. While you start with limited abilities, as you progress you unlock more and more abilities that help you not only in combat, but also to traverse the environment, even allowing you to return to previous areas and find secret paths and such. The combat is pretty challenging; playing on the second hardest difficulty was tough at the start, as I could go down with only a few hits, and although you get stronger as you progress, even the late game enemies can provice a fair challenge.\n\nThe setting, like I mentioned in the opening paragraph, is a fantastic world of antropomorphic animals. While most of the villages you find seem to draw inspiration from ancient Japanese towns, there's still technology to be found, alongside magic. All of this combined makes for an interesting setting, not to mention that there's many different regions you'll be visiting. The soundtrack does a good job at setting the mood as well, and the hand-painted art style is phenomenal.\n\nI had a great time with this game, and I can easily recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1582495332, "timestamp_updated": 1582495332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695939064025878906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63952675": {"recommendationid": "63952675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096880491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1804, "last_played": 1648400914}, "language": "english", "review": "The art is fantastic and the story is well plotted out, it keeps you guessing and entertained throughout.

They also mention that you need to have a working WMP and not have a certain security patch pushed by a Windows 10 update. I don't use Windows 10 so I couldn't tell you which one it is, but there's posts on the thread specifying what it is. Either way, it's fucking ridiculous that the community has to fix their game.

However, the developers refused to comment when asked, and instead expect the community to come up with a half baked patch with instructions that aren't very clear. \n\nGiven the game developers attitude towards trying to make a simple patch work, a patch that can be trusted, I would instead just recommend pirating the game.

Solidly done across the board, even difficulty curve, gorgeous music and very decent visuals; above all a very well thought out storyline.\n\nEDIT - Yknow, i should give this a proper review. Especially now that i finally beat it on max difficulty.\n\nGameplay - 9.5/10 - Excellent 2D sidescrolling adventure story, one that i would maybe add a few combat moves. Only thing I could penalise it on, and this is petty, is Id love to see a few more levels at the top end to make up for the amount of grinding you do. Its my one sorta petty beef with any game that has grinding - you never get to spend ENOUGH time at your top end once youve maxed out to kick ass and take names. TOS does this too.\n\nAudio - 10/10 Oh. Dear. Gods. Absolute audio bliss, from start to finish. Easily one of the best audio experiences you will have, better than even Unknown Worlds or Sonic CD, both in music and SFX. Absolutely PERFECT.\n\nGraphics - Again, for what it is? 10/10. Exceedingly well done, graphics that hold up VERY Easily even today. Eye Candy, with a camera that knows when to be close and when not to be.\n\nStory - 10/10. The only thing you wish, is for the next part. Amazing story that sucks you in and holds you throughout. If yer not a furry fan, this game will likely convert you.

Todos ellos sin excepci\u00f3n conservan su vigencia intacta y, aunque con reservas, no es diferente el caso para \"Dust: an Elysian Tail\".\n\nSi atendemos a su argumento, el videojuego que nos ocupa parte de la ya tan manida trama basada en la p\u00e9rdida de memoria de un personaje que est\u00e1 llamado a ser h\u00e9roe tanto en la lucha frente a un adversario mayor como en la lucha con su pasado. No obstante, y dejando de lado cualquier consideraci\u00f3n subjetiva, es justo reconocerle que cuenta con una trama con giros y m\u00e1s desarrollada de lo que suele ser usual en el g\u00e9nero \"metroidvania\", contando adem\u00e1s con multitud de l\u00edneas de di\u00e1logo e incluso con animaciones casi en el sentido m\u00e1s tradicional de la palabra. As\u00ed, enlazando con este aspecto, de su apartado art\u00edstico tan alabado en su momento cabe destacar tanto unos escenarios dibujados a mano como unos personajes y efectos tridimensionales (2.5D, podr\u00eda decirse) que imitan a la perfecci\u00f3n el aspecto de dibujo animado; y en esto, al igual que sucede con el argumento, los gustos de cada uno dar\u00e1n mayor o menor valor al resultado final porque, personalmente y apreciando el notorio esfuerzo puesto en \u00e9l, me hace recordar demasiado a cierto tipo de dibujos de animales antropom\u00f3rficos tan de moda en los a\u00f1os noventa y que, si bien funcionaban como entretenimiento infantil, se apoyaban en un apartado art\u00edstico bastante pobre.\n\nRespecto a su banda sonora y efectos de sonido podr\u00eda decirse m\u00e1s o menos lo mismo que con los anteriores apartados: acompa\u00f1a m\u00e1s o menos bien pero no resulta memorable en ning\u00fan caso y s\u00f3lo destaca la poco com\u00fan en estos juegos inclusi\u00f3n de voces (en ingl\u00e9s) en todas y cada una de sus l\u00edneas de di\u00e1logo.  \n\nPor \u00faltimo, el \"gameplay\" que suele ser el apartado a destacar en cualquier \"metroidvania\" que se precie, en este caso resulta un poco complicado de encasillar en tal subg\u00e9nero ya que se enfoca tal vez en demas\u00eda en la acci\u00f3n; teniendo, por supuesto, bastante de \"backtracking\", exploraci\u00f3n, misiones secundarias y \"plataformeo\", pero menos del que debiera en comparaci\u00f3n con tantos momentos de combate. Esto en ning\u00fan caso es malo si su vocaci\u00f3n es la de ser un juego de acci\u00f3n, pero, como fan de los metroidvania, deja un sabor un tanto amargo al ver que con un mayor equilibrio se podr\u00eda haber aspirado a un videojuego mucho m\u00e1s completo. Reflejo de esto son los escasos poderes (\"upgrades\") a los que tendremos acceso y que dan como resultado una menor atenci\u00f3n en cuanto a la exploraci\u00f3n de los escenarios, dejando todo el peso de las mejoras a las estad\u00edsticas de nuestro equipamiento y a un sistema de niveles claramente enfocado al combate. Adem\u00e1s, \u00e9ste \u00faltimo y ya sea contra enemigos regulares como contra jefes, resulta bastante sencillo en niveles de dificultad bajos cuando nuestro personaje posee unas estad\u00edsticas con las que ser capaz de arrasar con todo sin prestar apenas atenci\u00f3n a lo que sucede en pantalla, lo cual, por cierto, muchas veces resultar\u00e1 bastante ca\u00f3tico, pero ciertamente disfrutable. \n\nEn resumidas cuentas, \"Dust: an Elysian Tail\" resulta ser un juego con un apartado art\u00edstico, como poco, singular y una jugabilidad muy entretenida pero que, como \"metroidvania\", aqueja un enfoque demasiado orientado hacia la acci\u00f3n, la cual, aunque satisfactoria, podr\u00eda haber ajustado algo mejor su dificultad. Si buscas m\u00e1s acci\u00f3n que exploraci\u00f3n, ju\u00e9galo en modo duro o extremo; y si lo que buscas est\u00e1 m\u00e1s relacionado con la exploraci\u00f3n de escenarios y la b\u00fasqueda de secretos, puede que el modo normal te sea m\u00e1s que suficiente.", "timestamp_created": 1575823693, "timestamp_updated": 1575855781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634204268455505371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59483545": {"recommendationid": "59483545", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961343577", "num_games_owned": 792, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1061, "last_played": 1579301656}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gran juego", "timestamp_created": 1575798349, "timestamp_updated": 1575798349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59465046": {"recommendationid": "59465046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198421342533", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1318, "last_played": 1547416079}, "language": "english", "review": "For players who aren't very good at the game or wish to just experience the story, there is an Easy mode that allows you to play through the game.

As they go to save the world.\n\nAll right the likes, Well to start the story is really, really amazing, from its themes and its twists and turns to it\u2019s funny and light hearted moments. It\u2019s so amazing and really well made. The cutscenes in the game were all so really well made.\n\nThen there is the art style and it\u2019s really, really beautiful from forests to underground caves to even a haunted graveyard and beyond it\u2019s all really gorgeous and it\u2019s hand-painted which makes it even more incredible, especially you all the little touches.\n\nThen we have the characters, they were really good, my two fav\u2019s are Fidget, because she is so adorable and funny and Dust, he is badass and has a sharp wit and he can be funny too.\n\nThe voice acting is really well done from are main characters to even the NPC\u2019S its really well acted. The game play and combat was really good, fast paced and fun, the music was really good too. \n\nAnd the best was all the little touches from the notes you could pick up, the side quests you can do. The mini game you can play and the sound effects like the rain falling and even the snow crunching as you walk on it.\n\nOkay as you know from my other reviews this is the part where I talk about what is bad or what to dislike about the game.

The fact that Gaius focused so much time trying to figure out what his closest friend and best assassin was doing, basically opposing him, instead of just going and exterminating the moonbloods with his supposedly overpowered army THEN going after his supposed old friend means that he has nothing better to do. This is a problem since it means that your ultimate goal, stop the wiping out of the moonbloods, is basically impossible if not for Gaius' sheer incompetence or unwillingness to order his army to advance, unwillingness to do it without his closest friend to be there to witness their victory that they promised each-other they'd have. \nThis is only solved if Gaius literally arrived at the moonblood camp at roughly same time as Dust did, which would make sense in a scenario such as this one. The scouts in the mountains could have had additional spies hiding to keep tabs on the scouts, they could have switched the object of their focus to Dust when he killed the mountain scouts and followed him to the moonblood camp. They report back to Gaius that they have found the moonblood camp and Gaius moves his army to the final area of the game, final boss, etc.\nBut this is just my opinion of the story of the game, the gameplay is easy enough except for some instances of \"I PARRIED! WHY DID IT NOT REGISTER!\" or \"COME ON I JUMPED! I DID IT RIGHT THIS TIME WHY AM I STILL HITTING THE SPIKES!\" the game is a fun, relativly easy, slice and dice game with a nice touch of parcore that had great voice actors for all of its characters and amazing art and animation to go with it.

The gameplay is fun thanks to an excellent combat system and the story is entertaining to experience thanks to its memorable main characters. Unfortunately, the game is limited by certain facets that are not necessarily bad, but that are not necessarily good either.\n\nLet's start with the main positive: the combat. While there's not a lot of combos to speak of, what is there is so damn fun. The saying \"Easy to learn, hard to master\" doesn't really apply to this game. It's more like\u2026.. \"easy to learn, satisfying to execute\" since combos are never too difficult to carry out, but they still look really cool. For example, your bread and butter air combo is \n\nLight attack --? heavy attack (rising upper) --> 3x light attack --> heavy attack --> 3x light attack --> heavy attack --> repeat.\n\nThe above is not that hard to carry out, but the reason it's so satisfying is that the heavy attack in mid-air will cause you to do an air grab on the enemy, causing you to slam them into the ground, \"bouncing\" you and the enemy into the air so that you can do the whole thing over again. That air grab is just so damn satisfying to watch. For a long time it made me go like \"GET DOWN THERE BITCH\" :D . \n\nThe above works for any enemies that you can grab. What about enemies that you can't grab (i.e. enemies that are bigger than you)? Well, that's what the heavy attack is for. In this game, the heavy attack is a very satisfying \"spinning\" move. When you use it on the ground, you spin your sword in a circle, rapidly damaging any enemies caught in it. When you do it in the air, you become a spinning tornado of death :D :D :D. So for big enemies, you simply have to jump, hold the heavy attack button, and move left and right (i.e. if the enemy attacks right, go to their left side, and vice versa) until the enemy is dead. While this move is super powerful, it's balanced by the fact that you can't do it forever. If you use this move for too long, you will take damage and will be forced to stop using it. Kind of like overheating. \n\nWhile I listed 2 optimal ways to deal with enemies, the game has the flexibility to create your own combos so you can create your own fun. It helps that the heavy attack acts like a sort of \"skill cancel\". Having said all this, that doesn't mean that the game's enemies are pushovers\u2026\u2026 Ok some of them are BUT some enemies require specific ways to beat them:\n\n\t\u2022 There's an enemy that you have to parry (hold attack the moment they attack) in order to damage them\n\t\u2022 There's an enemy that you have to stun with magic first before attacking\n\t\u2022 There's an enemy that can only be damaged with magic attacks\n\t\u2022 Etc.\n\nYou will have noticed that I said \"magic\". Yea, there's magic in this game. It costs energy, and you also use energy to dodge. Because it does so little damage in the beginning, you mostly don't use it and it's a better idea to save the energy to dodge. However, in the late game magic becomes absolutely broken. This is because you can get loot that MULTIPLIES your magic stat by 3. You can equip 2 of these items for a total boost of 9 times. This is end game equipment, but once you get it\u2026.. Holy shit. Magic pretty much becomes the default best way to kill any enemy. This is because when you combine it with your heavy attack, it becomes a massive damage AOE. All of you have to do is hold heavy attack and press the magic button, and watch the screen fill with pretty colors. There's 3 different magic to choose from, so you can choose 3 different colors depending on your mood :P.\n\nWhile the combat is great, there's certain weaknesses in the game that limit its potential:\n\t\u2022 Bosses are too easy: All bosses are about your size, meaning they can be grabbed. They also get stunned on any weapon it. Therefore, it's very easy to constantly air grab them until they. When they take a certain amount of damage, they briefly become invulnerable, allowing them to use an attack. Still, that invulnerability only lasts for 1 attack, so you can just go back to juggling them. Most bosses are over in like\u2026.. 1-2 minutes tops. \n\t\u2022 Loot is just stat boosts: All loot are just stat boosts. The problem with this is that you'll always know that the end game loot will be better than any loot you find in the early to mid-game, so why bother exploring? Just keep going through the main storyline and only explore once you have all the movement abilities. Unfortunately, at this point most of the loot you'll find will be worthless, so the exploring aspect of the Metroidvania genre is severely crippled in this game.\n\t\u2022 Levelling up is streamlined: You level up in this game, but you're not free to choose how you spend your stat points. All stats have to be within 4 points with each other. This means that you can't really create a \"build\" and a character that you create will likely be exactly the same as anyone else's' character.\n\nIn regards to story, there's a main story that's broken up into smaller side stories. The main story is about your character Dust and figuring out who you are. Along the way, you're accompanied by a talking sword, Ahrah, and a flying sidekick named Fidget. These characters are absolutely fantastic, especially Fidget. She's so god damn funny xD. For example, in the very beginning you face your first enemy, and Ahrah is all calm and says \"Dust, focus. Remember what you've learned thus far\" and Fidget is like \"NO NO. MASH THE BUTTONS! DO SOMETHING!!!!\" I laughed so hard. This game has plenty of fourth wall breaking humour, and I just love it. I also love these characters personalities. Dust is the sarcastic but generally well-mannered protagonist. Ahrah is the calm old Sensei. Fidget is a hyper-active child (she constantly refers to bad guys as \"meanie\"). These 3 make for a wonderful trio :D :D :D.\n\nUnfortunately, while the main characters are very entertaining to watch, the same cannot be said for any of the side characters, and the story suffers for it. The story is about you ending the campaign of General Gaius, whose goal is to eradicate all Moonbloods from the world. In trying to achieve this goal, you'll defeat a guy whose trying to kill all Warmbloods as revenge for General Gaius killing all Moonbloods, bring back water to the world from an entity that stopped it in an attempt to kill Gaius's soldiers, and learn who are you and what your connection to Gaius is. These stories are focused around OTHER characters, and so whenever something happens to them, you end up not really caring. That's because there's just no character building done for any of the other characters. For example, there's a side character that dies near the middle of the game, and I suspect that the developer wanted me to care that he died\u2026. But I just didn't. While the script is great and the developer is trying to get some good lessons across such as \"sometimes your best isn't enough\", none of it really sticks. Even General Gaius, the main villain of the story, does not get any character development. All you know is that he's trying to kill all Moonbloods, but you don't know why and you don't know anything about HIM. Therefore, the final boss battle ended up being way less epic than it should've been. You're fighting someone who was your friend in the past, but there's no weight to any of it because the game didn't show me any of that history or who this final boss was a person. The voice acting is great though and there's some great lines such as \"I remember everything\u2026. AND IT CHANGES NOTHING!!!\" and \"THIS IS WHERE IT ENDS GAIUS\". Top quality stuff.\n\nOverall, this is a great game with great characters. It was entertaining to play throughout the experience and entertaining to watch the main characters interact with each other.

It turns out that if you focus on attack stat like I do (and you probably should if you want the fights to not take forever), simply flying back and forth in a swirl of blades trivializes almost all fights, especially aerial ones. Most of the time, if I'm doing something different, I'm spamming melee swings or am facing something that requires me to parry. Environmental hazards have killed me way more than monsters.\n\nSo yeah. This isn't a hard game, and cranking up the difficulty seems to just make it a little more important to grind some extra levels, which I haven't stopped to do. (I haven't done any grinding yet.)\n\nAnd can we talk about the story and dialogue for  a moment? I got vicarious mood whiplash from all the about-faces of attitude almost every time I talked through a conversation with someone, even on the game-spanning main quest. Especially on the main quest. The overarching plot is kind of meh. The protagonist is kind of lacking in personality, and that's a shame because having a strong personality despite lack of memory would be a fascinating way to play with the story and probably do better things with the currently-bland amnesia plot.\n\nI've had fun, though, probably because I'm a huge sucker for pseudo-RPG \"character advancement\" and the action is tailored less for elite action junkies and more for, you know, anyone else.

You play as a samurai who proceeds to get more and more mobile and powerful via story events and a pseudo-metroidvania styled action RPG system. The combat in this game is like playing as a tornado, at least on Normal difficulty. You'll literally be flying around the map flinging near screen wiping spells and proceeding to slash and slam peons and fling them into the air. Sure, you might encounter a few brick walls which may challenge you as a metaphorical tornado, but in the end, you're still a fucking tornado, and you'll win the 1 vs 1000 fight 50% of the time, every time. The story is surprisingly well written with a slight tinge of Eastern influence that brings it up, and a peculiar amount of world building that comes from the characters as well. Speaking of the characters though, a lot of people critique about two things:\n[olist]\n    [*] The uncomfortable nature of anthropomorphic animals\n    [*] Amateur but unprofessional voice acting\n[/olist]\n\nI don't have a problem with either of the two things listed, however I respect that other people may be put off by this. I would say however that those two points are really the only \"obvious flaws\" that the game has. The game is rock solid in everything else.

I remember thinking it was a bit too easy on my first playthrough years ago. However, more recently, I decided to revisit and bump up the difficulty to see if my impression changes; and it did, but maybe not for the best. I am having to consciously manage my actions and inventory a good deal more than the previous playthrough. However, I had to reset the game for my Tough playthrough because I was building my character a certain way and the game just became ruined when after like 5-6 hours, enemies that really can only take projectile damage show up. It absolutely crushed the pace of the game to the point where it made more sense to restart than just tweak my build. Even after changing the way I leveled up, I kind of felt that it almost would have made sense to use the 'auto-level' option instead of risking mistakes that can ruin a playthrough. That gripe aside, the story is pretty entertaining and the writing strikes a really solid balance between lighthearted and serious. The voice acting talent is high quality, also, for being an indie game.\n\nA couple of other cons after completing my Tough playthrough: exploration for the full map and treasure can really only realistically be done when you are about 95% done with the game, which kind of sucks for a Metroidvania. The lack of convenient, faster travel across the map is also a disappointment and makes the game pace really slog the further along you get.\n\nOverall, this game is worth at least a playthrough on normal for the art and story, especially if you like metroidvanias.

Boss fights are very easy and most of your deaths would be fighting trash mobs that one shot you throughout the course of the entire game regardless of how many points you put into life and/or defense. \n\nI honestly would not recommend high difficulty to even hard-core platformers such as myself just to save you the agony and it does not introduce any real difficulty to the game.\n\nI was so bored with this game, I was basically at the end of the game and I haven't bothered to launch the game to finish it, and honestly, probably won't. The combat at first seemed interesting, but then every single encounter in the game was basically: Launch enemy in the air using same weak weak strong attack w/e combo use magic and spin in the air. The counter mechanic is very generous. Often times I miss it because I tried to get a frame perfect timing. Game looked promising in the beginning where you were forced to counter the big mini boss golem thing and the game had potential but the difficulty did not increase at all throughout the game in terms of mechanical difficulty. Of course, enemies leveled up and did more damage. That was it. It was pretty mind numbingly frustrating to die 20 minutes past a checkpoint from some one shot ability. \n\nAlso, if you play on high difficulty I'd highly recommend you put stats into the magic damage ability because at one point of the game you are forced to use it to kill a necromancer enemy. I did not have it and it literally took 10-15 minutes of constant fighting and dodging to kill it and there were multiple occasions I had to do it. Bad game design to do that but it was my fault for trying to not get one shot and have most points in life/defense.\n\nVagrant is somewhat similar to this game since there are similar combo mechanics in that game except Vagrant is just better. Not a great game by any means way better than this game. I came for the metroidvania aspect so I'm fine with the game being easy, but the combat was seriously dull, repetitive, and grindy. The metroidvania aspect was not great and mostly involved just getting useless chests that contained mostly food. The game is not too non-linear either. Mostly linear.\n\nVoice acting was nice but I don't rate games based on things such as music, story, graphics, etc so take that into account. I still would rate the uglier version of La Mulana as one of the best metroidvanias and platformers in general ever made. Rabi-ribi is the best platformer - also a metroidvania.

It's short, but a worthwhile experience, in my opinion. All things considered, it's not actually that great a game, but I found it very enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is a short, hand-crafted work that you can tell its creators put their hearts into. These kinds of games have much more \"soul\" than most AAA releases out there, but usually come with their own issues.\n\nI'll start with the negative. I think the worst thing about the game is the size of the holes left in its story. The pace and execution of the story itself is not bad. In fact, it's engaging and, most importantly, it was fairly unpredictable. However, the game is very short, and therefore the story is too. Unfortunately, while the writer(s) came up with a very interesting and engaging story, the length seemingly disallowed them from expanding on critical parts of it. Though I suspect it might also have been some negligence, too. While the main protagonist's course is clear, the main antagonist has no background. We are presented with a situation on a grand scale, but the foundation for it, as well as the ramifications, are not covered. The story solely focuses on the main protagonist's personal journey, without regard for developing the rest of the story.\n\nBesides the story issues, I would say the combat, while fun, is not actually all that complex once you figure out how to abuse certain combos. It has a very fast-paced combat system that feels really awesome to play with. It's also very easy to pick up, with minimal control inputs. The depth that there is largely comes from movement interactions with the signature Dust Storm technique. However, by the end of the game, I was basically doing nothing but using Dust Storm... which kind of makes the rest of the kit redundant. This leads me to the final negative: the difficulty. I decided to play on \"Tough\" mode (the modes are Casual, Normal, Tough, Hardcore). In retrospect, I should have picked Hardcore. Most dangerous enemies, including bosses and even the last boss), have limited move sets that are very easy to deal with for experienced gamers. Factoring in how incredibly overpowered Dust Storm is, bosses are not much of a challenge. If you're keeping up on gear via crafting, you will also passively end up over-leveled. It is very easy to level up, and the bonuses provided from it are based on an steep curve, meaning that being even one or two levels over the area's average grants a massive advantage.\n\nAs for the positives, I already mentioned the positive aspects of the story and combat. I would also mention just how unique I thought the main characters' story really was, though. I have played a lot of games, watched a lot of movies/anime, and read a lot of books/manga, and the concept used at the core of the story is not one I have run into very often The story's original parts of the concept are most definitely unique. The greatest positives for me include the audio and visuals. The environments are drawn in a sort of hand-drawn or painted style that is really nice to look at (it's not Ori level, though). The music is a little bit hit and miss for me, but in general, the music is really nice and echoes the environment/atmosphere that it is played in. I think the greatest part of the game is actually the voice-acting. Kudos to the voice actors for doing a phenomenal job. Unfortunately, the dialogue wasn't the greatest at times, and the aforementioned background plot holes blunted the dialogue's impact, but even so the voice actors made the characters feel real and believable. It's remarkable how much of a difference good voice acting can make. Every character is voiced, and even the side quest characters speak with a realistic, believable character of voice that actually manages to draw your interest to random tasks, such as finding some lunatic's enigmatic lost box (which then has some interesting results which I will not utter here).\n\nOverall, Dust: An Elysian Tail is a game I can recommend. It has some issues, but despite them, it's well worth playing for people who appreciate games that have soul. I guarantee you'll have a blast with the combat system, even if the more experienced among you don't feel challenged by it. And as a final note, you'll probably enjoy the little easter eggs too.

The reviews were great, the combat looked slick and it's a metroidvania - a genre I really love! But the art style... didn't instantly click with me, because of some furry vibes I got from it. I started looking through reviews and opinions on the game, and I've stumbled upon one which said something along the lines: \"If the art style is the only reservation you have about the game, just give it a chance\". I decided to follow this advice and today I'm extremely happy that I did. While it's true that all of the game's characters are anthropomorphic animals, I'd say that its esthetics are a rather unique blend of \"slightly anime\" and old cartoons from the 80s and 90s. Even the game's subtitle (An Elysian Tail) refers to such cartoon (\"An American Tail\" from 1986). So, what I want to say by all of this is - even if you're not particularly fond of the game's art style, you should absolutely still give it a go. At some point in the game, you might even find yourself surprised that you ended up really liking this aspect of it, just like me.\n\nWith that out of the way, I need to say that the fact that this game was pretty much a one-man project is absolutely mind-blowing to me. I could accept that \"Braid\" or \"Papers, Please\" were done mostly by a single person. But when I heard that one guy (by the name of Dean Dodrill) made this awesome game with around 20 hours of content and only got help on the soundtrack, the voice-acting and half of the script, it wasn't something I could easily believe. When he started thinking about making this game, he was merely an illustrator and animator whose only contact with game development was some animation contributions for Jazz Jackrabbit 2. He only started learning programming and making his first simple micro-games about 4 years prior to Dust's actual release... What an absolute madman.\n\nLet's talk a bit more about the game's design - shall we?\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is a metroidvania with light RPG elements, slasher-like combat and rather simple, but humorous, charming and touching story. The game is divided into a prologue and 5 separate chapters. Each of the chapters introduces a new main location. Aside from that, there are also a few mini-locations you can visit as a part of some of the game's sidequests. In total, there are 12 unlockable locations you can choose on the world map upon exiting each of them. The metroidvania nature of the game obviously means that you'll need to revisit each of them if you want to unravel all of their secrets, but I didn't really feel an urge to do that before nearing the end of the game when I acquired the last of the character abilities, which would allow me to make the second run through the game, this time without skipping anything. This meant that a lot of the chests I now could reach were accessible to me sooner than at the end of the game, and they contained wearable items that were already far worse than my endgame stuff. I could still sell them and buy something more useful for me, but it's definitely an area of the game that could use some more balancing.\n\nThe combat is a thing you'll spend at least half of your playtime on. Thankfully, this is also one the game's biggest merits. It consists of several types of attacks you can easily chain into simple but striking combos. Once you get used to it, it becomes more of a dance than a fight - you fly all over the screen, cast really flashy spells and obliterate troops of creatures stubbornly trying to block your way. Even though I really enjoy the mesmerizing nature of the combat, it's also tied closely to my biggest issue with the game - the difficulty. There are 4 difficulty settings you can choose from (and apparently change in the middle of the game, but I only found out about that after finishing it...): Easy, Normal, Tough and Hardcore. But the thing is... according to both my own taste and many other opinions I've read, these are actually easier than their names suggest. I think they should be called (respectively): Beginner, Easy, Normal and Hard. I've played through the whole thing on what the game calls \"Tough\". I died a few times in Chapter 1, but once I got past the beginning and leveled up a bit, the difficulty curve dropped. The second half of the game was a breeze for me, including the final boss whom I defeated on my first try, despite dying a couple of times on the first boss. It's definitely not how it should be, but it's also nothing game-breaking (at least for me). I'd just recommend you to use my renamed difficulty levels to pick one for yourself and remember that you can always tinker with this setting in the options menu.\n\nAnother part of the game which really deserves some praise is the soundtrack. It's mostly composed by HyperDuck SoundWorks, who are not really well known besides their work on Dust and Kingdom Rush Frontiers. It's so surprisingly good that it instantly joined my collection of favorite game OSTs, and I still listen to it quite regularly, even though I finished the game over 4 years ago.\n\nOverall, despite some small issues, I consider this game to be a must-play.\n\nOh and by the way, if you decide to give this game a go and you happen to be a person who likes reading about game development, there are a bunch of very nice articles talking about the hardships of Dust's development processes. I really recommend checking them out, once you finish your playthrough ;)\n\n[h1]Achievement review[/h1]\nMy time to 100%: 23h\nEstimated time to 100%: 10-30h (depends on your playstyle, skipping the dialogue or not and whether you'll keep playing after getting all of the achievements to do everything else there is to do in-game)\n\n[b]Warning:[/b] there's 1 missable achievement (play on Tough or Hardcore difficulty) and a pair of limited ones (you need to save before choosing between 2 dialogue options to be able to choose them both in one playthrough).\n\nIn my opinion, the achievement design of this game is close to perfection. The achievements encourage you to explore all of the things the game has to offer and to try out some of the extra challenges. The ones that are missable or limited make sense to be there and avoiding skipping them is not a hassle. Once you finish the game, you can still load up the last save and continue on with the rest of the missing sidequests and collectibles. There are some tiny things I'd possibly change in some of them, but honestly, the developer did an absolutely amazing job with this aspect of the game.\n\n[h1]Suggested completion roadmap[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]Start the game on either Tough or Hardcore difficulty.\n[*]Play through the whole game working on the achievements whenever you feel you have a good opportunity to do them. The only thing you really need to keep your eye on is the fact that to collect both of the limited achievements in one playthrough you need to save in a separate slot once you receive \"a laundry sidequest\". During this sidequest, you'll need to make a certain choice. Once you get the first out of the two achievements, reload your save and pick a different choice to earn the second one of them.\n[*]Once you reach the last location in the game (Everdawn Basin aka \"the volcano location\") and acquire the last skill (Boost Jump which allows you to do very high jumps above air currents), you can go back to all of the previous locations and clear them out. Depending on your playstyle, you can either just get all of the missing achievements OR collect absolutely everything there is to collect to achieve the maximum 117% of total completion.\n[/olist]\n[quote]If you like what you read and want to see more reviews like this one, please consider following my Steam curator :)[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1562760782, "timestamp_updated": 1562877502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.775503754615783691", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54007243": {"recommendationid": "54007243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178316049", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1214, "last_played": 1690817977}, "language": "english", "review": "this is such an amazing game.
