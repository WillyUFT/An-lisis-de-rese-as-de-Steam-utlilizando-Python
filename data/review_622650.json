The game is broken down into multiple Acts/Chapters.\n\nIt features a manual save system, where you have to interact with an object to do so. There are also certain points in the game where is auto saves for you, but that is not as common.\n\nIt uses a Old Timey Animation Cell Shading art style and darker lighting to set a theme.\n\n[h3][b]My Thoughts[/b][/h3]\nThe art style in this game is amazing and the game looks beautiful.\nThe story is compelling enough but it's made all the better by the likable characters they introduce.\nBendy as an Icon is certainly very marketable since it just looks really cool.\n\nPersonally, I ran into some very nasty bugs in Chapter 3 where it apparently auto saved in a spot that caused me to be stuck in a wall on reload...the only way to salvage it was to completely play the game over from the start (that was awful). There was also a bug where loading the menu to look at the objectives caused the menu to be forever up until I reloaded the game. Looking online, Chapter 3 is apparently very problematic for many other people. There are reports (I didn't hit this particular bug myself) where the save system itself becomes scuffed and essentially stops being able to save at all, causing people to lose a ton of progress.\n\nThe game features an extremely simplistic combat system, it's basically just whacking things with a pipe or axe until it dies. No abilities or dodging to speak of. The puzzles in the game are also pretty simple, nothing too taxing. There is also a fair amount of going back and forth between areas.\n\n[h3][b]Recommendation[/b][/h3]\nPersonally, I recommend the game. I had a lot of fun with the story and visuals and that alone is worth it to me. However, I can definitely see people finding this game a little boring. I would say set your expectations with this game basically being a pretty walking simulator, that way you aren't going into it expecting a ton of action. If that appeals to you, then I'd say pick it up.\n\nI mentioned it above, but the bugs in this game (specifically chapter 3) are not to be ignored as a non-issue as they are pretty punishing when they happen. The developer doesn't seem to be inclined to fix them, as they have been there for years now. Something to keep in mind when considering your purchase, and how much you want to spend on it.\n\n[h3][b]Gameplay Footage / Shameless Self Promotion[/b][/h3]\nIf you'd like to check out some game play, I have a YouTube video of my play through here:\nhttps://youtu.be/TGnVtJAp6sI?si=EUwbBDWwhWeVfAId\n\nIf you don't mind hitting that subscribe button (it's free), please do so.\nHope this all

It's gone from a horror game to a puzzle action game. The art direction is very original, as is the soundtrack, but sadly that's all that's positive about this game. The story is nice but nothing more, the lore could have been more developed and explained. Combats are pointless, hitboxes are poorly located, puzzles are boring and repetitive, and the game is all about going back and forth, and sometimes dying makes you go faster and is in no way punitive. The fear factor is also quickly lost as the game progresses. Not to mention the mind-numbing number of bugs, save corruption and soft-lock if you go too fast. In short, a forgettable buggy game with a nice look.", "timestamp_created": 1700114265, "timestamp_updated": 1700120791, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150198112": {"recommendationid": "150198112", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044023355", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 194, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1700095523}, "language": "spanish", "review": "pura basura, no es entretenido es demasiado aburrido y la historia no se entiende en ningun momento.

THE CRYSTAL MAZE - INK EDITION\n\nThe iconic Crystal Maze setup, but with an inky twist. RICHARD O'BRIEN stands at the entrance, ready to welcome the contestants.\n\nRICHARD O'BRIEN\n(leaning on the door)\nGreetings, intrepid contestants! Welcome to the Ink Maze, a place where creativity meets chaos. Are you ready to dive into the inky abyss?\n\nCONTESTANT 1\n(nervously)\nUh, sure, Richard. But where are the crystals?\n\nRICHARD O'BRIEN\n(chuckles)\nAh, my dear friend, the crystals are hidden in the darkest corners of the ink-filled studio. Each one guarded by a mischievous ink demon. Good luck!\n\nThe contestants, decked out in ink-stained jumpsuits, venture into the first room.\n\nCONTESTANT 2\n(squinting)\nIs that... is that Boris the Wolf?\n\nRICHARD O'BRIEN\n(smiling)\nIndeed, it is! Boris will be your trusty sidekick. Just don't let him near the ink machine. We've had some incidents.\n\nContestant 3 discovers a puzzle involving ink splatters.\n\nCONTESTANT 3\n(confused)\nUh, Richard, what do these inkblots mean?\n\nRICHARD O'BRIEN\n(grinning)\nAh, the Rorschach Room. Interpret the inkblots, and you'll unlock the path to the next challenge. But beware, some of them might just stare back.\n\nContestants successfully decipher the inkblots and move to the next room.\n\nCONTESTANT 1\n(startled)\nWhy is Bendy just standing there?\n\nRICHARD O'BRIEN\n(smirking)\nAh, the Bendy Challenge. Convince Bendy to dance with you, and you'll earn a crystal. Just remember, he's got two left feet... literally.\n\nContestants awkwardly dance with Bendy, earning laughter from Richard.\n\nCONTESTANT 2\n(freaking out)\nInk monsters! Ink monsters everywhere!\n\nRICHARD O'BRIEN\n(laughing)\nAh, the Ink Swarm. Navigate through the ink monsters and retrieve the crystal. It's like a ballet, but with more splatters.\n\nContestants skillfully navigate through the Ink Swarm, earning applause from Richard.\n\nCONTESTANT 3\n(exhausted)\nRichard, can we go back to the original Crystal Maze?\n\nRICHARD O'BRIEN\n(chuckling)\nAh, my friend, once you've been inked, there's no turning back. But fear not, for you've proven your mettle in the world of Bendy and the Ink Machine!\n\nContestants exit, covered in ink, but with crystals in hand.\n\nRICHARD O'BRIEN\n(smiling)\nWell done, my ink-stained adventurers! You've conquered the Ink Maze and survived the whimsical horrors within. Until next time, keep the ink flowing!\n\nThe contestants leave, a mix of exhaustion and laughter on their faces.\n\nCONTESTANT 1\n(laughing)\nThat was wild, but I've never had so much fun in ink!\n\nCONTESTANT 2\n(exhales)\nI need a shower, but it was worth it. Richard's a mad genius.\n\nCONTESTANT 3\n(grinning)\nLet's do it again. Maybe with extra ink next time.\n\nThe Ink Maze adventure becomes a legendary tale in Crystal Maze history.\n\nFADE OUT.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699989283, "timestamp_updated": 1699989283,

This mostly comes from how the game just isn't well coded. And I believe this on all platforms, as even on everything but PC, the games extra routes actually are not possible. Some of this isn't completely in the developers hands as they don't exactly have access to the source code. There are a few major glitches which can just ruin the first playthrough as well as subsequent playthroughs.\nBroken path-finding on AI, broken sequencing, a glitch that prevents you saving as well as a large amount of softlocks.\n\nIf you are choosing to get this game, seeing that sale price it often goes down to I would at least consider some of these bugs before. I have (plug) created a mod, if anyone did want to play it which cleans the game up around the edges and removes some of the bigger bugs and it can be downloaded on game banana https://gamebanana.com/mods/471415 (plug over)\n\nDark revival the sequel does some things better, and generally is a lot better coded so if you were to start with a bendy game it isn't the worst to play though I have my issues with it i definitely haven't played as much as I have batim.

I think it would've made it more understandable.\n\nIf you run into any bugs, do your own research for whichever game save files you may need, but I'll link the guide I used that helped me with getting achievements and understanding how to remedy the biggest bug which is the save error.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1896583376", "timestamp_created": 1699505154, "timestamp_updated": 1699506210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149793164": {"recommendationid": "149793164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047993509", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 312, "last_played": 1699501861}, "language": "english", "review": "Save files are buggy so you lose all your progress\nIf you enjoy collecting soup cans and pulling levers while running at a snails pace I guess it's alright", "timestamp_created": 1699502016, "timestamp_updated": 1699502016, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149786636": {"recommendationid": "149786636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016405450", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2732, "last_played": 1699501740}, "language": "english", "review": "l", "timestamp_created": 1699490493, "timestamp_updated": 1699490493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149781795": {"recommendationid": "149781795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030283664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 197, "playtime_at_review": 3389, "last_played": 1700692639}, "language": "spanish", "review": "BATIM es uno de los mejores juegos que probado 5/5 10/10 cinco estrellas", "timestamp_created": 1699482558, "timestamp_updated": 1699482558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149775352": {"recommendationid": "149775352", "author": {"steamid": "76561199168012431", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1700009121}, "language": "spanish", "review": "god juego para revivir los momentos de terror xd ta bien 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1699473719, "timestamp_updated": 1699473719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149764153": {"recommendationid": "149764153", "author": {"steamid": "76561199333866314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 426, "last_played": 1699458599}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es muy bueno mas que es uan nostalgia", "timestamp_created": 1699459116, "timestamp_updated": 1699459116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149755982": {"recommendationid": "149755982", "author": {"steamid": "76561199482528100", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 396, "last_played": 1699874557}, "language": "english", "review": "Bendy and the ink machine has been really important for me throught all these years: it`s a community driven series with interesting ideas and atmosphere. Thought, i`ll do my best to keep away my bias while writing this review.\n[olist]\n[*]Gameplay:\nIt may feel really slow and repetitive at times. Ch 3 (even with being my favourite) suffers from this the most: you`ll go through a lot of fetch quests that aren`t rewarding or satisfying to do.\n[*]Combat:\nCombat sometimes makes this game /hard/ for reasons that weren`t intended. Hit, step, repeat...It could`ve been improved with making the combat system *a bit* more complicated.\nAlso hitboxes of some enemies have weird placement which means that there`s huge chance that you`ll miss while hitting them.\n[*]Characters:\nThe ink demon, the titular character and main anti-hero, lacks screentime in his own game. \nHe either doesn`t appears where it could have been possible to implement him (most of ch4 and ch5) OR he gets overshined by other characters.\nIn general, BATIM introduces a lot of characters that it can`t always use to their full potential. It could be fixed with either planning story before making games or by making games with smaller character cast.\n[*]Lack of some basic features:\n- You`ll be forced to do small stealth sections without being able to crouch/peek around the corners\n- You can`t skip custscenes on your replays\n- Sometimes game lacks any directions and it`s not clear what are you supposed to do (but it`s mostly linear so it`s fine)\n- Saving system is buggy and the way it works could be improved\n[*]Bugs:\n- You`ll loose your progress a lot,especially in ch3. Limited amount of save stations doesn`t help at all.\n- Boris can fall throught the floor/elevator can stop working/hearts quest can bug (all in ch3) which may softlock you from continying the game.\n- Vizual bugs/ character AI bugs can happen too.\n[/olist]\nTalking about good things, i recommend checking the game for story, characters or artstyle.

You're no Doom marine, you're a former cartoonist so don't expect crazy combat.\nVoice acting and music/ambiance are top notch creepy.  \nThe scares are mostly jump scares and some tension when you think you're about to be chased.\nMy only gripe about this was that I played this on my Steam Deck for about 2 hours or so, noticed that I wasn't getting achievements, then got stuck in Chapter 4.

You can't manually manage saves & reload a previous one, so the \"solution\" online was to restart the game from the beginning. Not the first person this has happened to either, and not the only spot in the game this can happen.\n\nOn top of crashes & save bugs, there are just a lot of missing QoL features. Support for >60 FPS & keymap rebinds are the two that immediately come to mind.\n\nThe game itself is alright. It's immediately presents a unique story with compelling and promising aesthetics, but it then fails to follow through in any front. The gameplay is bland and wonky, the \"puzzles\" are often just collect-athons and time wasters, and you'll do more walking than anything.\n\nHorror games tend to interrupt the walking and puzzles often with, y'know, horror elements. But this game is anything but scary. There are little to no stealth mechanics. Instead, when faced with most enemies, you're just given a big axe to swing. What is scary about one-shotting crawling ink balls? The only time I was \"scared\" were cheap jump scares.\n\nOverall, don't waste your time, even without the save bugs. 2/10.", "timestamp_created": 1698030774, "timestamp_updated": 1698030791, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519704461097717285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148703550": {"recommendationid": "148703550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350482714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1291, "last_played": 1688007587}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1698016606, "timestamp_updated": 1698016606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148690256": {"recommendationid": "148690256", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998478765", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1545543947}, "language": "english", "review": "The game sets up a cool world, though I feel it falls apart in the final chapter, trying to force combat into a game that's not properly designed for it.", "timestamp_created": 1698000443, "timestamp_updated": 1698000443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148678293": {"recommendationid": "148678293", "author": {"steamid": "76561199417529605", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1698010631}, "language": "english", "review": "W game would recommend :)", "timestamp_created": 1697988179, "timestamp_updated": 1697988179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148675957": {"recommendationid": "148675957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987180209", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 211, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1699997608}, "language": "english", "review": "very gut.", "timestamp_created": 1697986086, "timestamp_updated": 1697986086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148645854": {"recommendationid": "148645854", "author": {"steamid": "76561199484316543", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1698888488}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely Amazing!

Easy 8/10.\n\nIt is a pretty simple horror game in terms of gameplay. Most of it is exploring environments, listening to audio logs, and finding collectibles while completing simple objectives the game gives you. The game is 5 Chapters long and my first playthrough only took me about 3 hours.\n\nCharacters and story are very interesting. Exploration and combat are simple and satisfying with some interesting world puzzles. None of the puzzles were too hard unlike other survival horror games. The art style is very 1920's cartoons with black, white, and parchment-yellow colors. Loved it!\n\nHOWEVER I did run into a few issues with the game. During my first attempt of a playthrough, I got the seemingly infamous \"autosave bug\". Everytime the game autosaves, a little Bendy head appears in the lower right corner of the screen. It only appears for maybe a second if the game autosaves successfully. But when this bug occurs, the autosave head will not go away and the game will never properly save. I sadly got this bug on my first attempt at a playthrough and upon finishing Chapter 1 and quitting for my first play session, I came back to the game the next day and my save was nonexistent.\n\nNext problem I ran into was on my next attempt at a playthrough. It was something that is actually in the game as a feature but the game doesn't even tell you about. So when you start a new game, if you choose \"Chapter Select\" instead of \"New Game\", the game will begin on the chapter you choose but DISABLES SAVES! So if you are a dingus like me and choose \"Chapter Select\" instead of \"New Game\", you lose any progress during that play session. Sadly, I had made it to Chapter 3 in my first session of my 2nd playthrough attempt. I quit the game, then the next day booted up to see that the game to see that, once again, I had no save.\n\nTLDR: Game is great, in every aspect, however I had a lot of trouble with the lack of information with starting a new game and the infamous \"autosave bug\" deleting my first ever save.\n\nOn to Bendy and the Dark Revival next and I am hoping that game has less oddness when it comes to the save system.", "timestamp_created": 1697315489, "timestamp_updated": 1697315489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148221076": {"recommendationid": "148221076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023612410", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1689957008}, "language": "english", "review": "Did not enjoy a single second of playing it.

Even recorded the first two chapters for the internet. Then I get to chapter 3... and find a bug that breaks the entire game. Two, actually. One was fixed by a friend remoting in and fixing it, and that was the options menu Black Screen of Death. My friend and I are not game devs, we shouldn't have to fix bugs on a game that's been out as long as this one as. I was willing to overlook that, until I got to the game breaking bug.\n\nI'm in chapter 3, trying to finish one last fetch quest, and the last of the items I need to collect is nowhere to be found. I do my circles, anxiety building, thinking maybe I just overlooked it. Nope, still can't find it. So I turn to google to see if there's a bug or if I'm still missing something. As it turns out, it's a bug that prevents you from being able to progress, one that's been a major issue since 2018.\n\nSo here I sit, with a game I was so eager to play despite not being a horror gamer, with one of the most popular indie horror games being totally unplayable.

This game is good... in the beginning. Once you get to chapter 3 it falls apart fast. This game is okay and I recommend playing it only once. I am as of typing this almost 100% in the game and some achivements are obscure. This game is long, too long. It feels like some of the things put into the game was put there to make the game long and they get to keep their money. An achivement is for collecting every bacon soup can in the game. This sounds easy at first until you realize there are some in places where you cant get them again. And also that Chapter 3 is the biggest in the entire game, so GOOD LUCK. The ONLY achivement I don't have is valued employe where you have to get through an area without being spotted, sounds simple with a challange on paper RIGHT? Well this is sooooo stupidly hard with the fact that this game has NO STEALTH MECHANICS, and that also is if you can get over there without being softlocked with how many glitches are in chapter 5. This game also has a glitched where if you see the little bendy save icon, CLOSE THE GAME. That is the only answer to stop this glitch or you could just continue until you decide to stop playing and have to play the last two or more chapter you already did.

It has a great atmosphere and really gives you that \"creepy Mickey Mouse\" vibe. The puzzles aren't too difficult and the overall game play is smooth.  That's the positives about the game and if there weren't any negatives I would easily give this a positive recommendation.  However, the first time I played this game I was doing a series for my YouTube channel and ran into two bugs I'd consider game breaking. First, don't ever pause the game.  If you forget your objective it is listed on the pause menu but it's a bit of a coin flip regarding getting rid of the pause menu.  The game might unpause while leaving the pause overlay on the screen.  The only way to remove it it to close the game... hope you saved recently.  Speaking of saving, the second bug I ran into is the game stopped saving.  I lucked out and made it passed Chapter 3 (one of the longest chapters) but saving stopped working in Chapter 4. Looking at other recommendations, it appears that this seems to be a bug that plagues a lot of players so it's not uncommon.  When going back to try and get all the achievements I had to replay Chapter 4 just to get to Chapter 5 resulting in a colossal waste of time.  If the developers would fix these VERY basic game breaking bugs the game would be a real treat and it's a shame that they don't appear to have any interest in doing so... it's been out for 6 years by now.

The characters are all great and the voice acting is also great.  There is a bit of slight repetitiveness on one of the chapters, but that was most likely because of the way i played the game, having done a lot of exploring before proceeding with the story.  Overall definitely a recommend, however....  There is a lot of bugs in the game that i noticed in my first playthrough, and many more in later ones.  None were really game breaking for me during the first run, but they were for others, and I had a great deal of trouble with them on later runs myself.\n\nAs for bugs, here's what I encountered:\n-The menu would sometimes be stuck on screen and you'd have to close the game to fix it.\n-Sometimes the save system would mess up and you'd have to close and restart to fix it.  It will just stop saving and the save icon will either not work at all or stay on screen, when you notice this you have to restart.  First time i didn't notice it was a problem i lost 2 chapters of progress, another time, it completely deleted my save file entirely for the 2nd profile (first one was fine still).\n-One time i was trapped in a room with doors that should have been opened and weren't after reloading the checkpoint, soft-locking me from continuing, and replaying chapters doesn't allow you save either, so I would have to restart the entire game to fix that.\n-One time one of the scripted events didn't happen, [spoiler]After the Sammy fight and you have to fall through the floor in the narrow hallway afterwards with the boards[/spoiler] and so I forced it to happen on my own by [spoiler]breaking the board with my axe and falling down, which caused Alice to follow my in to the next room, but none of the doors worked in that next room[/spoiler].\n\nThese bugs however, were only really apparent on future playthroughs, they were not enough to give a bad review cause I did really enjoy my first run through the game.\n\n------------------------------\nControl Scheme I Used:  Keyboard and Mouse with default bindings.  Mostly OK, but the mouse sensitivity would go very weird (usually turn up a crazy amount) if the the framerate drops too low in certain areas.  I would often have to close other things I was doing and set the quality down in the game to fix this, even though I have a fairly competent computer I think.  Probably some bug with the Unity engine.\n\n------------------------------\nWorth the current price (CDN$ 24.99)?  Yeah, that's a fair price I'd say, little short but definitely good, wish it wasn't as buggy but that doesn't really take much away from the first playthrough you do.\nWhat I actually paid: $7.37\n\n------------------------------\nCompletionist Review:\nDLC Achievements: No DLC.\nRating:  Not too bad, missing a single item require a full 2nd playthrough of the chapters though, but not the whole game.\nCan be completed in one run:  Two chapters I believe would have to be redone\nChapter Select: There is, although no real indication of which need to be done other than the achievements themselves.\nDid I need/use a guide?  Oh yes, for sure, on lots of them.\n\nThe bugs I encountered really made some of the achievements very painful to get, specifically the save bug, or being soft-locked, etc.  Not being able to save in chapters is super annoying too.  Past this it's not really super bad, there's collectibles, a couple skill based things... not horrible if you dont take into account the bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1695753416, "timestamp_updated": 1695753416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574235796928405762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147074814": {"recommendationid": "147074814", "author": {"steamid": "76561199387339901", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1695500406}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is bad, The jump scares are bad and the atmosphere is not scary. the chapters are boring with you just find stuff, place the stuff, chase scene, then next chapter and repeat. other scary games are much better, let me give you an example of games to play instede of this game:\n\n-Resident Evil 2 and 3\n-five nights at freddys\n-dead by daylight\n-escape the backrooms", "timestamp_created": 1695753155, "timestamp_updated": 1695753155, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436507940292358398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147049314": {"recommendationid": "147049314", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121282704", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 672, "last_played": 1695718746}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is very good", "timestamp_created": 1695717612, "timestamp_updated": 1695717612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485781997442245483", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147044199": {"recommendationid": "147044199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202046408", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 329, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1593202232}, "language": "spanish", "review": " es un juego que ha atra\u00eddo la atenci\u00f3n de muchos jugadores por su estilo de horror y su estilo de animaci\u00f3n retro.

recommendation because as a whole, I did enjoy my experience with it. And then I remembered I ran into a bug where the game does not save at all. That tipped my recommendation immediately, because this game has been out for over six years now, hundreds--maybe thousands of people reported this bug, and the developers [i]still have not fixed it by 2023[/i], despite having enough time to make an entire sequel. Anyway, onto the actual game now.\n\nChapter 1: Great. \n\nGreat atmosphere, great setting, mysterious ambiance, short and to the point. Does a fantastic job of getting you immersed into the world and plot. Plus the visuals in the factory are outstanding.\n\nChapter 2: Good.\n\nOnce again, outstanding visuals. I loved the introduction of Sammy Lawrence (for how brief he was in the game), and the voice acting from him and the recordings were all well-done. I even liked some of the puzzles since they were randomly generated and not the same every time. They were kinda fetch quests, but at least they put a little flavor to them instead of \"Get the key to open the door to get another key to open another door.\" This chapter also introduced combat. To be blunt, the combat is ass. Some goomba ink-blobs crawl towards you. You whack them a couple times with an axe. That's it. It's not fun; the monsters aren't scary; no skill is required. The chapter does end with a nice chase sequence though. Sadly, the game does go downhill from here...\n\nChapter 3: [b]TRASH.[/b]\n\nThis is the worst chapter in the series--and yes, I'm including the second game (which I also played). You run into Boris, a friendly side character who, after a brief introduction, doesn't really do anything else. The remainder of this chapter is a bunch of annoying fetch quests. You gotta break cardboard cutouts; you gotta get \"special\" ink, blah, blah, blah. Why? Padding. That's it. And every time you do it, your weapon changes. Why? Because the game said so. Once again, the combat is boring and not fun. The fetch quests are tedious and only exist to waste time. They're not even puzzles or anything fun; you go up some stairs, get the thing, then you have to [i]go all the way back downstairs[/i], and then [b]go all the way back up the damn stairs again![/b] If you cut out these fetch quests, this chapter would be twenty minutes long, probably less.\n\nThe only positives I can say about this chapter (besides the visuals), is that the voice acting, once again, is well-done, and this chapter introduces the Ink Demon. Sometimes the Ink Demon will appear at random. And when he does, he will instantly kill you if he catches you. There is no jump scare; there is no big alert; nothing. The game subtly gets darker, you hear him breathing, and you see him slowly stalking around in a room until he disappears. [i]This[/i] was done excellently, and this is a proper way of introducing an unbeatable antagonist in a horror game without resorting to annoying jump scares or over-the-top sequences.\n\nChapter 4: Great\n\nMaybe it was because I was so pissed off over Chapter 3, but I actually really liked Chapter 4. It's largely due to some of the story \"twists\" that occur this chapter, along with introducing two surprisingly fun boss fights, which I'm not gonna spoil. Again, great visuals and voice acting, etc. There's a section where you need to stealth past some enemies by distracting them, as opposed to simply whacking them with a weapon. There are two mini-games involving ball-throwing and shooting that I did not like, but apparently if you lose enough times the game makes you win anyway. So that was good. I don't have a lot to say here, mainly because it's heavily story-based and has spoilers.\n\nChapter 5: Disappointing\n\nEhhhhhh, yeah. Not a good finale. We team up with two new characters (kind of) and there's one cool sequence where we all fight together against the ink blobs. That was fun. What was not fun is when you get separated from them, lose your weapon, and then have to go on [i]another[/i] boring fetch quest that is done to pad the game's length. Sure, you have to avoid the Butcher Gang here, but when you find the item that you need, all you gotta do is sprint back and forth to that area. This section would've been so much better if the item in question randomly spawned in this maze, thereby forcing you to be stealthy. Because when you know where the item is, there's no need to bother being sneaky. There's a boss fight that amounts to whacking a guy, running away, whacking him again, rinse and repeat. And the final boss fight amounts to finding four switches, flipping them, and avoiding a big monster charging through a maze. There's another section to this fight, but that also isn't difficult. Or fun. And then there's some cutscenes, and the game ends.\n\n\nOverall, in spite of my issues with this game, I was intrigued with the artstyle, the worldbuilding, the lore, and even some of the characters (the ones who actually did anything). Not a big fan of the combat, but I did like a couple of the boss fights. And the ending was disappointing.\n\nMan, I really wish Steam had a middle recommendation. Because I don't [i]hate[/i] this game in spite of my frustrations, but I can't recommend this game either. And it's because of that bug I talked about earlier. I know, I know; there's a workaround to make it so that you can unlock all the chapters. But I should not have to hunt down a workaround online just to make the game [i]tolerable[/i]. It doesn't fix the save bug either; it just unlocks all the chapters. If the game or your computer crashes in the middle of Chapter 3, you gotta start all that shit over. Sorry! I would be more lenient on this game if I played it when it came out and I found this bug, but several years have passed. The developers found enough time to make both a sequel and a spin-off game. Why the fuck haven't they fixed this bug?\n\nSo yeah, I can't recommend this game. And judging by the recent reviews, I'm not the only person who ran into this bug. And even then, the game still has other issues with it. It's weird, because I would recommend you play the sequel, but the sequel ties heavily into the story of the first game....which I would not recommend.\n\nAin't that a bitch?", "timestamp_created": 1695479943, "timestamp_updated": 1695696410, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146824662": {"recommendationid": "146824662", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085862873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1642450809}, "language": "english", "review": "game too scary for me give me a refund fat man! uhhhhh jayden jerkoff harcut", "timestamp_created": 1695434316, "timestamp_updated": 1695434316, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146824193": {"recommendationid": "146824193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834034240", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1642211898}, "language": "spanish", "review": "MIckey Mouse? :b", "timestamp_created": 1695433713, "timestamp_updated": 1695433713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146821428": {"recommendationid": "146821428", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208032404", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1695495271}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Cum negro", "timestamp_created": 1695430048, "timestamp_updated": 1695430048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146821092": {"recommendationid": "146821092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364647726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1530111487}, "language": "english", "review": "It's broken", "timestamp_created": 1695429560, "timestamp_updated": 1695429560, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146815446": {"recommendationid": "146815446", "author": {"steamid": "76561199470623320", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 116, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1700399807}, "language": "english", "review": "100000000000/10 would recommend.

My point is, everything about the gameplay is tedious and feels like a way to prolong its time to complete.\nHorror would be a stretch to describe this game. Not even a single time has it manage to scare me. It involves cheap jumpscares and a big monster chasing you and that's the whole gist. \nWhile the story might be worthwhile, i would need to dive deeper to decide fairly. Not to say that the story makes it a must play.\nBendy and the Ink Machine caters to streamers, youtubers and children through and through.

balanza de la recomendaci\u00f3n o no est\u00e1 muy pareja y resulta dif\u00edcil tomar una decisi\u00f3n objetiva, es mejor probarlo por uno mismo y extraer un veredicto.\n\nLa historia de este juego se muestra a trompicones, en principio encarnamos a Henry Stein, e invitado por nuestro socio Joey Drew nos encontramos en un estudio de dibujos animados de los a\u00f1os 20 que tuvo mejor gloria pero que poco a poco ha ido sucumbiendo al \u00e9xito y a las extra\u00f1as pr\u00e1cticas de este \u00faltimo, se nos narra en cinco cap\u00edtulos donde aparecen otros personajes relacionados con \"la tinta\" que no desvelar\u00e9 y c\u00f3mo la estrella del estudio Bendy, ha degenerado en un monstruo y a partir de los rituales han aparecido numerosos engendros creados a partir de tinta. Punto de vista atractivo el de la historia, pero la forma de darla a conocer es a veces anodina, siendo los dos primeros cap\u00edtulos bastante vulgares, mejorando el tercero y sacando lo mejor del juego en los dos \u00faltimos.\n\nEn algunos momentos dar\u00e1 la sensaci\u00f3n de estar jugando a algo parecido a \"Bioshock\", pero solo por la ambientaci\u00f3n y la forma de dar detalles de la historia con las grabadoras, pero nada m\u00e1s lejos de la realidad, este juego est\u00e1 a a\u00f1os luz.\n\nUn aspecto negativo dentro del juego es su duraci\u00f3n, es bastante escasa, aparecen m\u00e1s horas por sacar alguno de los logros, y lo que es peor, buena parte de esas horas las pasaremos dando vueltas de un lado para otro buscando objetos que nos pidan, o huyendo de alg\u00fan enemigo, lo que acrecienta la sensaci\u00f3n de aburrimiento.\n \nGr\u00e1ficamente el juego es muy original, la sensaci\u00f3n de encontrarnos en una pel\u00edcula de animaci\u00f3n de los a\u00f1os 20 est\u00e1 conseguida, el entorno gr\u00e1fico est\u00e1 cuidado aunque pasado un tiempo de juego se vuelve mon\u00f3tono, el tono sepia llega a ser cargante y todo se ve sin variedad, los escenarios son muy similares unos a otros y cuando se recorren a la larga aburren, puesto que en muchas ocasiones son pasillos interminables, adem\u00e1s de la poca interacci\u00f3n con elementos del entorno, que a veces no est\u00e1 clara.\n\nLa jugabilidad es en primera persona, movimiento bastante tosco, al personaje le cuesta arrancar a moverse, y es algo frustrante puesto que aparte de la exploraci\u00f3n, habr\u00e1 muchos momentos \"survival horror\" estilo \"Amnesia\" en los que deberemos correr para escapar de monstruos, deberemos resolver puzzles sobretodo de encontrar piezas que necesitemos para progresar u objetos que nos pidan; a veces nos tendr\u00e1n de recadero dando vueltas de un lado para otro chocando con objetos y teniendo que combatir con enemigos, como digo excepto los dos \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos que mejoran, el resto son m\u00e1s bien ins\u00edpidos en este sentido. Adem\u00e1s, hay lucha en primera persona y \u00e9sta resulta decepcionante, dar golpes a los enemigos es una odisea, porque no se puede esquivar, te dan sin poderlo evitar y el movimiento es tosco a m\u00e1s no poder, dicho sea de paso, la variedad de enemigos es muy escasa, cuatro engendros hechos de tinta y un par de los que hay que huir y esconderse con relativa facilidad. Y un par de jefes finales. Si nos matan reaparecemos muy cerca de donde se produzca la muerte, en unas estatuas de Bendy,\n\nEl aspecto sonoro es decente, con unas voces en ingl\u00e9s logradas y efectos sonoros adecuados, la banda sonora es escasa pero algunas piezas son buenas, est\u00e1 traducido pero existen algunas faltas de ortograf\u00eda y en la fuente principal los acentos aparecen con otra tipolog\u00eda al no disponer de ellos, algo que se ve bastante cutre.\n\nEn definitiva lo que m\u00e1s llamar\u00e1 la atenci\u00f3n de este t\u00edtulo es su ambientaci\u00f3n, el tono sepia tan original y una historia pasable, que comienza francamente mal para ir mejorando poco a poco, el ejemplo a seguir es el de los dos \u00faltimos episodios, m\u00e1s variados y redondos, con una jugabilidad m\u00e1s \u00e1gil, mayor variedad en entornos y enemigos, premiar la exploraci\u00f3n y mayor desaf\u00edo ser\u00eda un juego bastante interesante, este primer Bendy parece m\u00e1s bien una prueba. A duras penas lo puedo recomendar.\n\nNOTA 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1694882726, "timestamp_updated": 1694884063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56106412410736084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146397347": {"recommendationid": "146397347", "author": {"steamid": "76561199200383210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 744, "last_played": 1668183368}, "language": "english", "review": "OH MY GOD!

You play as a former employee returning to the abandoned studio at the behest of your former employer. It takes place over the course of five chapters, totaling roughly four hours of gameplay, more if you decide to replay chapters.\n\n[h2]Presentation[/h2]\nThe most striking element of [i]Bendy and the Ink Machine[/i] is the visuals. Every environment is depicted with thick black edges and imprecise lines, making the world appear like a cartoon from the 1930s. It\u2019s such a unique art style that is executed almost perfectly. One of the best effects the visuals have is highlighting what doesn\u2019t fit into the cartoon world. Globs of ink drip from the ceiling, ink creatures roam the floors, contrasting with the studio itself. They don\u2019t have the same art style, instead being shown with relatively standard 3D graphics. It\u2019s an interesting stylistic decision that works in tandem with the art design to give weight to the horror elements. The world of [i]Bendy[/i] feels familiar, but with something sinister beneath the surface.\n\nOn the other hand, I felt that the animations could\u2019ve used some work, especially the player\u2019s animations which looked stiff and uncomfortable. They weren\u2019t horrible, but they didn\u2019t complement the cartoon aesthetic as well as the lighting or art direction did. Similarly, I found the voice acting passable, but it never stood out as one of the game\u2019s strengths.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWithin the first thirty minutes, you quickly get a feel for what the whole game will be like. It\u2019s horror blended with a walking simulator, puzzles, and light combat mechanics. Depending on the chapter, there will be a different focus, but for the most part, you\u2019ll be getting one of these three concepts. I found the walking simulator portions to be the strongest; they build tension very well, don\u2019t overstay their welcome, and when they include a jumpscare it feels earned rather than lazy or cheap. You have time to walk around and take in the environment, playing to the game\u2019s visual strengths.\n\nUnfortunately, the puzzle and combat portions were tedious, uninteresting, and killed any atmosphere and tension the game had previously. I generally enjoy puzzles, but most of the ones in [i]Bendy[/i] consist of a checklist of items you need to collect, rather than something you need to think about and actually solve. There are a couple of genuine puzzles, but they are few and far between, and certainly not strong enough to be worth the wait.\n\nAs for the combat, I felt that it could have been removed from the game without missing much. You only fight the lesser ink creatures and they are quite easy to defeat. They would feel scarier if you actually had to run from them or sneak past them, but forcing you to kill dozens of them waters down their fear factor. They also exclusively spawn from ink piles, so it\u2019s not much of a surprise when they pop up, you can see it coming from a mile away. To make matters worse, the combat mechanics are rudimentary, boiling down to simply clicking on an enemy once to defeat them. It\u2019s clunky because of an odd invincibility window when enemies spawn, coupled with the fact that combat clearly wasn\u2019t fleshed out or polished in any significant way.\n\n[h2]Performance[/h2]\nWhile graphically it looks great, you can easily tell that it\u2019s not a AA or AAA game when it comes to polish. There are numerous bugs I encountered during my playtime, although only one was significant; when I got stuck between the game and the pause menu, preventing me from moving or exiting and forcing me to alt-f4. For the rest, they were minor issues like getting stuck on part of the level, an NPC failing to trigger the next part of a level, etc. I also encountered odd frame drops a few times, without a clear explanation as to why. I would assume it was during some effects-heavy portion of the game, but it was hard to say exactly what it was, so your mileage may vary.\n\n[h2]Verdict[/h2]\n[i]Bendy[/i] was a mixed bag, but I would ultimately recommend it. If you enjoy walking simulator horror with a little bit more interactivity, this could be right up your alley. The art is fantastic, and the horror is usually solid, but it gets let down by some of its more half-baked mechanics. I don\u2019t know if I would pick it up at full price, but it\u2019s unique enough to be worth checking out the next time it goes on sale.\n\n[h2]6/10[/h2]\n\n[quote]\nMild performance issues running on: [b]AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, 16 GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 3070[/b]\n[/quote]\n[quote]\nFollow our Curator page, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41449676/]Summit Reviews[/url], to see more high quality reviews regularly.\n[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1693835670, "timestamp_updated": 1694024648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657810688018798828", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145649569": {"recommendationid": "145649569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043693378", "num_games_owned": 1407, "num_reviews": 1397, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1693827555}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty decent cartoon-style walking sim.

The lack of a save feature turns what could have been a somewhat interesting experience into an exercise in frustration and anger management.\n\nStory line is really fun and interesting, second game was great. Disappointing you can only play this game if you are willing to do it all in one sitting...\n\nSave yourself the headache and avoid this like the plague.

It was SOOOO SLOW it felt weirdly unnatural, even when your character is supposedly \"running\" it feels like he is limping, all the time... And for the same reason, some bosses seems to be purposely made moving VERY slow to compensate for the slow protagonist, thus those boss fight made me feel hilarious (instead of supposedly scary / daunting). The whole pacing and slowness keep making me felt as if the dev purposely did it to extend the player's playtime (since the game is short).\n\nOther than that, the game is also kinda bad news if you care about achievements. Some of the achievements / collectibles require you to immediately turn back to area you've already explored and SPAM interaction keys on stuffs / doors you've probably interacted previously (example: a previously closed door or un-interactable box is now miraculously open-able BUT only right after you successfully cleared the obstacle to the next area, AND you need to backtrack IMMEDIATELY because moving forward would close you off from the collectibles / achievement), and this is without any hint mind you... How is that even fun...? Definitely not a clever design to me.\n\nLastly, I've also met game-breaking bugs, TWICE! I got stuck in 2 different part of the last chapter, and what's worse, you cannot even restart the chapter, using chapter select would forbid you to save mid-game for gods know why (so you can't re-attempt some achievements at save point), the frustration is REAL, especially when the game is SO SLOW... Everything added-up made me wasted hours for that last achievement... Fortunately at last, I found someone shared a chapter 5 save file online, allowed me to 100% it without needing to restart from the beginning.\n\n5/10 at best due to these astounding experiences,

"review": "[h1] (Not all) Dreams come true [/h1]\n\nPese a las horas que he invertido en este juego, tras meditarlo, no puedo recomendarlo, pues a\u00fan en su estado actual, se siente como un juego a medio desarrollar, con m\u00faltiples problemas que pueden llegar a afectar a la jugabilidad.\n\nLa premisa era buena, y el planteamiento de lo m\u00e1s original, pero se nota much\u00edsimo que es un proyecto hecho sobre la marcha, y las diferencias entre los distintos cap\u00edtulos son abismales, adem\u00e1s de que la coherencia y la cohesi\u00f3n entre los mismos es bastante pobre. \n\nAsimismo los primeros dos cap\u00edtulos se sienten cortos y superficiales, si bien son los que mejor logran \"rescatar\" la tensi\u00f3n y el terror del juego. Quiz\u00e1 en un juego con 20 cap\u00edtulos se notar\u00eda menos la poca profundidad, pero al ser uno de 5, se nota much\u00edsimo que estos dos primeros est\u00e1n pr\u00e1cticamente vac\u00edos.\n\nEn otro tercio, el cap\u00edtulo tercero de [i]Bendy and the Ink Machine[/i], se hace de lo m\u00e1s pesado ya que en este se nos obliga a hacer tareas absurdamente repetitivas e insustanciales, que no dejan de ser pobres excusas para alargar la experiencia de juego de manera ag\u00f3nica.\n\nFinalmente, los cap\u00edtulos cuarto y quinto, son en mi opini\u00f3n los m\u00e1s interesantes del juego, y es que, en mi opini\u00f3n, si este estuviese compuesto por seis o siete cap\u00edtulos como estos dos \u00faltimos, quiz\u00e1 mereciese m\u00e1s la pena, pues al contrario que sus antecesores son m\u00e1s profundos, y se nota en ellos que se aspira a una mayor seriedad narrativa.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, en lo relativo al terror, como comentaba un poco m\u00e1s arriba, a mi no me ha parecido muy all\u00e1, y tensi\u00f3n lo que se dice tensi\u00f3n la genera en los primeros dos cap\u00edtulos, luego se convierte en un cutre pilla-pilla con alg\u00fan [i]screamer[/i] ocasional. Id\u00f3neo para quienes les guste el terror en dosis micro, un poco meh para m\u00ed.\n\nEn resumen, el apartado art\u00edstico es soberbio, y las premisas sobre las que el juego pretend\u00eda erigirse de lo m\u00e1s creativas, ahora bien, el resultado a m\u00ed me parece bastante mediocre, por no decir decepcionante. Esperaba algo m\u00e1s.\n", "timestamp_created": 1692754906, "timestamp_updated": 1692754906, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586206912994384766", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144816390": {"recommendationid": "144816390", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092455563", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1693588790}, "language": "english", "review": "Please fix the save glitch TheMeatly I need to save my progress for my videos", "timestamp_created": 1692739095, "timestamp_updated": 1692739095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144804287": {"recommendationid": "144804287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797884099", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1514825225}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ni me deja jugar el juego xdxdxdxd", "timestamp_created": 1692725193, "timestamp_updated": 1692725193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144749050": {"recommendationid": "144749050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198988061949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 386, "last_played": 1696069777}, "language": "english", "review": "Had the Urge to drink Ink after this game idk why\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1692652655, "timestamp_updated": 1692652655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144723964": {"recommendationid": "144723964", "author": {"steamid": "76561199071111187", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1692632801}, "language": "english", "review": "This game tickles my bootyhole in all the right ways", "timestamp_created": 1692633010, "timestamp_updated": 1692633010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144713752": {"recommendationid": "144713752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198952901866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 362, "last_played": 1692622623}, "language": "english", "review": "MY MASTERPIECE!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1692622781, "timestamp_updated": 1692622781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144693673": {"recommendationid": "144693673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198448523098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 18392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18391, "last_played": 1694896457}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely a good game.

Overall stylization and the sepia effect have some special charm. Gameplay wise it is mostly good, I think the most disappointment for me was the 5th chapter, because it made it much more obvious that fighting mechanic was bad (the delays, the lack of impact), and AI was... Strange? There is a stealth-like part in the 5th chapter and I was noticed once, ran away (even without hiding) and then I have not seen any of the 3 monsters. I heard them somewhere, but they did not appear. The final fight with Bendy had a similar problem, since it did not look like Bendy was targeting me at all, even during tubes stage. All in all, I think it would have been better if this was just a puzzle game with \"horror\" elements.\nWhat also was good was the story, or rather the lore. I definitely want to learn more about this ink-world and how it is connected to real world. Too bad the ending of this game did not answer any questions, but there are 2 more games in the series, so maybe they will clarify things.\nAnyway, if you do like exploratory kind of games and like the art style of this one in particular, I can recommend it.

Con una muy efectiva est\u00e9tica de dibujos animados de a\u00f1os 30 en tonos ocres y negros, y una original historia, el juego es una mezcla de exploraci\u00f3n, sigilo y combate cuerpo a cuerpo (en este \u00faltimo aspecto es muy mejorable). Controlaremos al socio co-fundador de un estudio de dibujos animados explorando las viejas instalaciones del estudio y descubriendo que est\u00e1 poblado por monstruos de tinta, as\u00ed como que varios de sus personajes (no necesariamente amistosos) han cobrado vida. El combate lo realizaremos con tuber\u00edas, hachas, llaves mec\u00e1nicas, etc. Adem\u00e1s de mediocre y repetitivo (todo el rato golpear y retroceder) es muy tosco. Por ello los momentos boss-fight no son precisamente memorables. Los golpes restan bastante salud, as\u00ed que la mejor opci\u00f3n tras recibir uno es alejarse los segundos que tarda en reestablecerse totalmente. La exploraci\u00f3n y el sigilo est\u00e1n bastante mejor, ayudados por la poderosa est\u00e9tica del entorno. Tendremos armarios donde escondernos de los enemigos. Aunque a los m\u00e1s comunes los podremos eliminar, hay zonas en los que deberemos usarlos por ir desarmados o porque el enemigo es inmortal. \n\n\nEl juego tiene un problema inaceptable, y m\u00e1s teniendo en cuenta que el juego es de 2017 y deber\u00eda ya estar corregido: A partir del cap\u00edtulo 4 el sistema de salvado est\u00e1 buggeado. Me ha pasado (y por lo que leo a muchos otros), que salgo del juego tras el \u00faltimo boss del cap\u00edtulo 4 o incluso tras la horda del 5 y cuando lo retomo me encuentro que el juego me manda al inicio del cap\u00edtulo 4, a pesar de todos los puntos de control que he pasado desde ah\u00ed hasta el punto en el que sal\u00ed. As\u00ed que deb\u00e9is saber que los dos \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos (4 y 5) deb\u00e9is jugarlos de un tir\u00f3n u os arriesg\u00e1is a perder todo el progreso. Y para rematar la faena, hay un momento en el cap\u00edtulo 5 (tras acabar con la horda) en que estoy atascado sin saber qu\u00e9 hay que hacer para avanzar, dando vueltas como pollo sin cabeza en busca de alg\u00fan \u00edtem o alguna salida. Hasta que miro v\u00eddeos en Youtube y en absolutamente todos un NPC se va hacia una puerta y la abre (???). Entiendo que es un bug que se ha producido durante la pelea con la horda, porque salgo de la partida (otra vez a empezar desde el cap\u00edtulo 4\u2026) repito todo y esta vez el NPC s\u00ed abre la puerta (???).  En la pr\u00e1ctica he tardado bastante m\u00e1s tiempo en terminar el juego por todos estos errores. Me parecen lo suficientemente graves como para poner una rese\u00f1a negativa, pero bueno, estoy de buen humor y la voy a dejar positiva por los muchos aspectos destacables que tiene el juego (que a\u00fan as\u00ed me parece que est\u00e1 m\u00e1s hypeado de lo que merece). \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691333605, "timestamp_updated": 1691333605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143498775": {"recommendationid": "143498775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871857916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1691296240}, "language": "english", "review": "Very scary & cool.

And even if the sequel does end up being more polished, I REFUSE to take a chance with their track record. I doubt the developers will ever look back to read my comments or that of other countless players, but rest assured I won't be buying another one of their buggy products. There is no excuse.

I first got the game on my ps4, back in 2020, after talking to my family about it for months non-stop, My uncle was the one who bought me this game at first, and i greatly thank him for it. And the game itself was beutiful, the puzzle element is super fun, It has the right amount of twists and turns, so you never know what happens next, and the boss battle with bendy was super fun! I completed the game only just yesterday on my computer, the before I posted this. Like i said before, My uncle was the one who got me the game originally, But unfourtunetly, he left us just last year...Playing this game reminds me of him a lot, and i know i made him proud when i completed it for the first time. I wanted to say thank you to TheMeatly, Mike Mood, and the whole develpment team that worked on this game, Yall did absolutly amazing, and i also wanted to say thank you for making this game a reality, so i have somthing to remember my uncle by, and to just absolutly go crazy over. If i hadnt found this game, i never would have been writing this review. And now, im happily playing Bendy and the Dark Revival, the most amzing sequel too a game i have ever seen.

The only challenge in the game comes from completing the achievements, but the achievements are broken in a way that you must replay the game several times to actually get them since simply using the chapter select, for some bizarre reason, does not save your progress. The sepia-toned visuals make the game very interesting in terms of atmosphere, but the story is so nonsensical that it doesn't really feel like you're progressing in any meaningful way. I'm not really sure how to relate the idea of this story since it seems improvised ad hoc as the developers were designing the nonsensical levels. I think you play as animator, I'm not sure, and you start out in an animation studio before descending into some insane mess of wooden tunnels that don't exist with any rhyme or reason. I suppose that alone would make the game interesting, but problems arise when you start to see multiple versions of the same three characters showing up in the game without really getting any explanation as to why. I think the ink machine in the title is what's creating the characters, but there's no explanation as to what's going on so it doesn't really matter. It's basically just your \"demon is chasing after you\" trope tied up with a bunch of stream of consciousness level designs. \n\nEssentially, you move around, manipulate switches, pick up items, and collect cans of bacon soup that serve no purpose and are way to ubiquitous throughout the levels since they serve no purpose other than to provide an achievement. And honestly if the achievements were a fair challenge I would give this game a positive rating, since they are the only thing that provides a challenge in the game, but they are broken and glitched. For one, some unlock seemingly at random, like one that said I listened to all the audio logs in a level when I only listened to one. \n\nThe problem is that without the achievements this is essentially just a walking simulator with no real puzzles or challenges other than figuring out where to go. It's essentially Bioshock, which is a clone of System Shock, which is a game that came out 30 years ago and only justified its infinite respawns by making the combat complex and difficult. In this game you almost always have a melee weapon, and survival just means whacking the enemy and retreating before you die. The combat is atrocious, but there isn't much of it, so it almost doesn't matter. Beyond that, quite often the game encourages you to get annoyed wandering aimlessly because you needed to open the crate after you triggered some random scripted event, even though you walked past it and tried to open it five minutes ago. I get that it's essentially an indie game, but since it's so easy and random it comes across as being amateurish and irritating rather than creative and quirky. I really do like the Bendy character though, and the various other animations. The voicework on Alice Angel is also very good. There are only three boss fights and they are barely boss fights since in two of them it's impossible to fail. There's a carnival ride boss that looks really creepy and intimidating but since he doesn't actually do anything but spin around there is no actual challenge since you can simply stand outside of his spin radius and avoid all damage. I can't really buy that this is intended as a children's game since it involves cultists, murder and has a bunch of adult themes running through it. However, even if it was a children's game there still needs to be some pass or fail element to justify it actually being a game. As I said, some of the achievements are challenging, but you have to play through the game like five times to get them since the auto-save is broken and if you chapter select you don't get to save and thus cannot even unlock some of the achievements this way. This leaves me with a game where i feel like I've accomplished nothing because there was no real challenge, and in trying to find a challenge end up more disappointed because the structure of it doesn't justify investing 40 hours to be a completionist for what is otherwise a mediocre and meaningless experience.", "timestamp_created": 1690092555, "timestamp_updated": 1690092555, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142611064": {"recommendationid": "142611064", "author": {"steamid": "76561199246315130", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 521, "last_played": 1690068558}, "language": "spanish", "review": "la verdad la est\u00e9tica de este juego te envuelve mucho", "timestamp_created": 1690066878, "timestamp_updated": 1690066878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142607825": {"recommendationid": "142607825", "author": {"steamid": "76561199452671703", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 800, "last_played": 1697835119}, "language": "english", "review": "You get harassed by a 2 foot cardboard cutout.", "timestamp_created": 1690062133, "timestamp_updated": 1690062330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142600354": {"recommendationid": "142600354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145549514", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3784, "last_played": 1699114462}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a trash game and fuck bendy  and who ever made this game", "timestamp_created": 1690052754, "timestamp_updated": 1690052754, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142600352": {"recommendationid": "142600352", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085699604", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "playtime_at_review": 611, "last_played": 1700557806}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best games ive ever played, i love the whole style and theme, and definetly dont simp for sammy *wink wink*", "timestamp_created": 1690052750, "timestamp_updated": 1690052750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142599463": {"recommendationid": "142599463", "author": {"steamid": "76561199068539325", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1696785259}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is paced not so great but the art style and characters really drive the game to be great.

Let me get to the positives first.\n\nPOSITIVES!\nI like the visual style, sure it's all this boring yellow and brown but I must say that it is very visually unique. I like the fan made songs that they included, nice variety of them, sadly Chapter 5 got an original song but either way I like the decision to include them. I also like the concept of just going like 300,000ft underground since Chapter 1, like how do you get back up. The horror is also something I enjoy, it's not scary for most of it, but stuff with the Projectionist  and especially Ink Bendy feel pretty cool and I wish there was more of it. Also going off the visuals, it looks absolutely gorgeous, at the start it was just simple shading but when they released this could make a full game, they made it beautiful. I like the subtle replay value with the seeing glass, it's a neat way to make me wanna play again, and I fell for it, it was actually fun playing looking for these hidden messages. \n\nNEGATIVES!\nEverything after Chapter Two is bad, especially Chapter Three which is (I shit you not) a one hour fetch quest, that sucks ass. And Chapter Five is such a anti climatic end to the game, I don't care about the loop thing, I don't mind the actual ending, what I do mind though is how boring the last Chapter is. I feel like doing another fetch quest is dumb, and they even make fun of that in that Chapter. Characters are terribly voice acted at times. I like the tapes with the employees giving inside prospective on the studio, but the voice acting is bad. The only voices I actually like are Bertrum Piedmont and Joey Drew and maybe some others I'm forgetting. Henry is also not voiced well, it feels like he's trying to be this epic action hero and this wimpy guy half the time. Getting back to the Chapter Five stuff, the Beast Bendy fight is cool but I feel beating him up would be cooler besides just running around. Combat is also not fun, you run so slowly and healing takes unironically like 10 years. This game is also very buggy, especially Chapter Three where both on Consoles and Steam it can just refuse to do the part it's supposed to.

Never thought I'd use that word in a review but its true\nThe puzzles are tedious. \nThe combat is terrible and the game uses it A LOT. You move at a snails pace with a tiny hitbox and the over use of combat really takes away from the tension. Seriously the Wolf fight was pure anus.\nThe story is flimsy. They don't build up the horror or exposition. They just start right off the bat with the jumpscares and a no point does the game get frightening. Then at the very end they dump exposition. \nThe voice actors are over doing \"old timey\" accents. Though credit where credit is do the character of Wally was a fun one.\nThis game made me feel like John Rolf's AVGN tbh.\nIf you really want to try it, go for steam summer sale like I did.

I restarted today (so that I could play through this game before tackling the sequel) and bumped into a yet another, different game breaking bug in chapter 3.  The funny thing is, I KNEW of this bug before I even encountered it since there are dozens of posts discussing it in the community forum.  Despite that knowledge, I wasn't able to avoid it.  You basically have to avoid a a mini-boss while hunting for five items in a small, poorly lit maze.  If the boss manages to kill you (which he did to me), one or more of those items may despawn, making progress literally impossible.  Reloading the game does not fix the issue.  In fact, the game mistakenly assumes you collected all five items while still blocking your progress.  \n\nI really wish I could recommend this game, but after hitting two separate game breaking bugs I just can't.   This game came out 6 years ago so I'm not optimistic about a patch.  Sadily, my recommendation would be to avoid this game because game breaking bugs that ruin your play-through just aren't acceptable.", "timestamp_created": 1688347678, "timestamp_updated": 1688347678, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141177443": {"recommendationid": "141177443", "author": {"steamid": "76561199474046485", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1700598398}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game", "timestamp_created": 1688343757, "timestamp_updated": 1688343757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141175127": {"recommendationid": "141175127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312068741", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 582, "last_played": 1689436143}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta weno", "timestamp_created": 1688340885, "timestamp_updated": 1688340885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141174456": {"recommendationid": "141174456", "author": {"steamid": "76561199244169029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1698940612}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego es bueno, pero tiene algunas cosas que mejorar.", "timestamp_created": 1688340139, "timestamp_updated": 1688340139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141166883": {"recommendationid": "141166883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052583268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1688148612}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10 Very good game.\nBeautiful artwork and a very engaging rich story.\nProbably the best game in the series.\nDefinitely recommended.\n", "timestamp_created": 1688332038, "timestamp_updated": 1688332038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141162341": {"recommendationid": "141162341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203710157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1623004623}, "language": "english", "review": "mid gameplay. just watch markiplier play it on youtube", "timestamp_created": 1688328202, "timestamp_updated": 1688328202, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141153298": {"recommendationid": "141153298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401002262", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 829, "last_played": 1688408782}, "language": "english", "review": "bedyn", "timestamp_created": 1688321198, "timestamp_updated": 1688321198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141152805": {"recommendationid": "141152805", "author": {"steamid": "76561199217173147", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1690687486}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor juego de mi infancia.

It truly captures what made Bioshock & System shock great and turned into it's own IP. Cool semi-cartoon visuals look familiar like it was used by the same engine that TellTale used for their The Walking dead franchise. Eerie soundtrack works perfect with every situation be it walking thru a hallway or defending yourself from ink demons. Voice actors that were used for tape recorders were great with that Boston Italian accent or those strong accents from the Southern states of U.S.A.. The story was also a pleasant surprise especially in chapter 5.\n\nCONS: This game has probably the worst \"sprint\" in all of games I ever played. To be honest it's slower then a fast walk. Also this game has MAJOR BUG PROBLEMS!!! In chapter 3 I encountered a save file bug which was saving my file for more then an hour. I finished chapter 3 and started to play chapter 4 then left the game. But when I returned to play the game I was taken back to chapter 3 when the save file bug encountered and there I lost my time to play over chapter 3 again. The second bug I encountered was in chapter 5 when I punched my ticket to save the game, I left the game with 2 doors opened for progression. I came back to play the game and I was spawned at the save checkpoint with both of those doors closed and LOCKED! I had to start over chapter 5 for this reason and again losing over an hour of my damn time.\n\nCONCLUSION: Despite in dire need of patches for fixing the bugs I mentioned under cons, I still truly recommend this game because I really had a good time with it and instead of waiting for a brand new entry of Bioshock & System shock, just play this franchise instead because it's interesting,

The most important thing a game needs to get right is the save function. This utterly fails on that score: There is a single save file for multiple saves slots, which is prone to corruption; There is no hard save, only autosaves at checkpoints and using a punch card machine interactive object; You can't save your current game into a new slot, only new games, making the slots effectively useless; There is a well documented save bug that has always been there and is still a problem 5 years after release.\n\nI recommend making frequent backup copies of the game file, called batim.game, in order to have a fallback in case of very likely corruption. Corruption can come in many forms. Chapter 5 is particularly bad for this. There are numerous places in which you can find yourself soft locked on restarting a saved game. Perhaps the worst offender is a punch card machine in a hallway where the doors start out locked. I've punched that machine and then quit and restarted, only to find that I'm then locked in the hallway with no means of progressing. That's very poor.\n\nIt has a good concept and feel, and it is a useful starting point to get the backstory of the world before playing the sequel, Bendy and the Dark Revival, which is a great game and superior in just about every respect. If you can stand the issue with game save backups and you can get it on sale, I say go for it. That said, a lot of the game play can be quite tedious, with annoying fetch quests to get done.

TheMeatly did it right. THIS is how you make a horror puzzle game.

You can feel the effort they put into it. \n\nThe game started off in chapters, and they slowly built upon one another. Then there were updates, cut, paste, move this here, upgrade this, do that; the team was not afraid to throw out a product and let the fans decide \"Hey, maybe you guys should do this.\" They freaking listened to us and we got this masterpiece. BATDR is another one as well. \n\nI love this fandom and I love this game. Seriously. Get the game.\n\nIf you dream of playing a great game with fun graphics, a 1930's inspired animation that does credit to the time period, good voice acting, lots of machine ASMR, a great storyline, and a ton of fan theories and potential for a great series with devs that care, then trust me: Dreams Do Come True.", "timestamp_created": 1687413434, "timestamp_updated": 1687413434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140473784": {"recommendationid": "140473784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452824766", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1689879042}, "language": "english", "review": "Only thing scary is that the entire game is fetch quests.

So I thought why not? I can even vent my hatred for the sequel even more! So why do I like this one so much more as to leave a positive review than the sequel? Because the game just felt overall much more flushed out than the sequel. The weapons you use get changed pretty frequently as you go along with each one feeling different than the last and helps to keep things somewhat fresh. There is even a secret tommy gun you can get! It doesn't stay with you forever but it is fun. There is also a secret scythe weapon but I never got my hands on it. Meanwhile in the sequel you got to use a pipe for the entire game with lackluster upgrades. Enemy variety is also a lot better and the bosses vary greatly. The only thing I give the sequel over this game (besides graphics and sound) is the final boss being a lot better than the Ink Machines final boss.\n\nThis game just felt so much more fleshed out compared to the sequel. The sequel felt like it was trying to do a lot more but just didn't flesh out each feature enough or polished them enough. This game even though its lacking those added features resulted in a better focus on everything else and therefore a better overall experience.\n\nAnyways! Besides all that I do have one more final good note to say about this game: The achievements are not an absolute drag to acquire. I didn't find myself slogging along banging my head against the wall trying to get them all which is always nice!

All very unique in terms of visuals and lore. I wish there was more variety in the poster art scattered everywhere, but that\u2019s a minor complaint. The voice acting is good and it all comes together to provide a great experience.\n\nAs a survival horror, Bendy & the Ink Machine is pretty light. For the most part, it\u2019s all atmosphere building up the tension. The big bad, the Ink Demon, shows up infrequently and there\u2019s often a box to hide from him in near by. The conventional enemies are far more likely to be the cause of your death. If you\u2019re looking to dip your toe into survival horror, this game is a great starter.\n\nAll that said, for me, the absolute worst part of the game was the save system. It broke, severely, within the first 3 chapters. You can tell your save has become corrupted because the Bendy icon, which appears in the bottom right corner of the screen momentarily when your story progress automatically saves or you use a punch machine to manually save, that icon does not go away and just remains on screen. There is no way around it expect to exit the game totally and then restart from wherever it left you off. I had to replay sections of Chapter 2 several times, and parts of Chapter 3 even more. Absolutely ruinous to the immersion and enjoyment of the story. Probably lost a good hour or more of game progress because of that. It seems that if you\u2019re still [i]within[/i] the game, you can reload those saves, but as soon as you exit all that progress is toast. That a game from 2018 should have that buggy a save system is inexcusable. Worst part is that the console version apparently does not have that issue, nor really any other bugs.\n\nThe only other truly infuriating bug I had was the fight with Sammy in Chapter 5 bugging out while replaying that chapter after beating the game to try and get one of the achievements.\n\nAside from that, the game ran fine. No stutters, no noticeable frame drops (on 2560x1440). Achievements popped when they were supposed to.\n\nIn the end, Bendy & the Ink Machine is a great introduction to survival horror for anyone new to the genera, or a bit of a light romp with cool story and setting for veterans of that type of game. But due to the appalling levels of jank that it still has (and will never be patched out by this point), if you\u2019re thinking of picking it up, I cannot endorse getting it at full price.

The main story lasts about 4h to 5h.\nNow let's have a quick review:\n\nThe good:\nThe art and graphics are great and original. The color scheme gives you this old reel vibe, that I believe the creators were after. The enemy design is interesting. The puzzles were fun and not too challenging, which I think is good for a horror game. Most of the voice acting is also great, and the sound design is fitting as well.\n\nThe Neutral:\nThe story didn't really do it for me. I'm not sure if I fully understood what was going on, and why the world/map was the way it is.\nThe game isn't all that scary. There is always an abundance of light, and when you're being chased, you run at the same speed as your chaser. And due to the linear design of the levels, you'll find a hiding spot eventually. And no matter how far your chaser is behind you, entering a hiding spot ends the chase and keeps you safe. This means that you never really feel threatened.\nThere are dark bits (with flashlight) in the game and a ventilation shaft part in the game, but the creators didn't really do anything with them.\n\nThe not-so-good:\n1st of all, this games doesn't let you customize your controls, which is a big no-no for me. The game assumes you've got a QWERTY keyboard, and if you don't, that's on you to fix this.\nThe combat is clunky. You hit slow and depending on your weapon and enemy, need to hit the enemy multiple times. This ends up becoming you standing in front of the enemy, hitting him a couple of times while he's hitting you, and then running in circles while you're recovering health. This is not interesting gameplay. \nThe playable character's voice acting is bad, which is unfortunate as all other characters have great voice acting. The playable character's voice sounds monotonous and emotionless.

Easy to manage, given their slowness or poor deduction\n-Little terror effect, lots of vintage effect and mystery\n\nAgainst:\n-Frequent bugs, sometimes trick lights or effects but shouldn't cause too much trouble for anyone\n-Gameplay too small, few possibilities; which was fixed with the sequel \"Bendy And The Dark Revival\"\n- Good plot, but short. Easily manageable in a few hours, frankly not totally worth the price\n- Mediocre, slow and weak AI. There are almost never moments of struggle or anxiety\n\nConclusions:\nIt manages to do its job, which is to give the player an adventure in a mysterious world submerged in mysterious monsters, with a dark past and an uncertain future.

From Bendy's mischievous chuckles to Alice Angel's seductive allure, the voice work enhances the overall immersion and adds depth to the already engrossing narrative.\n\n\u200f\n\n[h1]Replay Value and Extra Content: Unlocking the Mysteries[/h1]\nBendy and the Ink Machine offers significant replay value through its hidden collectibles and multiple endings.

Steam has me logged at 11.4 hours so that's over 4 hours of lost time due to faulty saves.\n\nIt's a neat game that feels like a dumbed-down ripoff of BioShock placed in an art studio.

gameplay es aburridisimo y los puzzles son mas densos que desafiantes, la mayoria (hasta donde jugue) son buscar una tuerca y tenes que recorrerte 10 pasillos con piezas hasta que la encontras, el siguiente es abrir una valvula que esta del otro lado de los pasillos y los siguientes son encontrar 2 valvulas o 2 tuercas o 5 valvulas y 5 tuercas, la verdad se hace mas tedioso, especialmente con la idea de que tiene un combate super basico donde aparecen unos enemigos que te spamean golpes y vos tenes que spamear primero para no morir ya que no hay otra mecanica que pegarles con el click, y si caminas hacia atras como intentando esquivar te pegan igual o sea que no tiene ningun sentido hacer otra cosa que solamente golpear, y bueno es basicamente eso, caminar una velocidad de un metro por d\u00eda, haciendo puzzles de la tuerca o la valvula y spameando a los enemigos que spammean en tu cara o en tu espalda.\n Entiendo el atractivo del pseudo mickey mouse diabolico endemoniado en la empresa maldita de dibujos animados, por otro lado el estilo narrativo me recuerda bastante a Bioshock, y supongo que para algunos eso puede ser suficiente para pasarse el juego y disfrutarlo pero el gameplay me parece muy malo incluso para este tipo de juegos que por cierto apenas tienen gameplay, sino son de ir a punto \"A\" a punto \"B\", pero no es excusa para que sea tan engorroso, lento y malo, tampoco ayuda tener unos \"puzzles\" tan aburridos .\n Por el Lado grafico ni siquiera quiero opinar, tengo un 5800x3d 32gb de ram y una 6700xt y en juego en ssd y tira bajones de fps y aunque tengas 165 fps clavados a veces se siente que patea o hace stuttering. Y por \u00faltimo otro tema que es insoportable es que en algunos objetos o puertas (no todas) tenes una especie de \"auto apuntado\" que te absorve la mira hacia ellas y de pasada genera una especie de aceleracion del mouse, lo que hace que el 50% del tiempo que quieras mover la camara de repente termines apuntando a cualquier lado o tengas que corregir dos o tres veces movimientos excesivamente basicos, el desarrollador que program\u00f3 eso no se como fue capaz de conseguir trabajo ya que hasta para jugar con joystick es insoportable que haga eso la c\u00e1mara.\n En fin creo que esta muy sobrevalorado, tampoco es tan genial la historia como para pasar por alto que todo el resto sea impresentable, por esta razon no lo puedo recomendar.", "timestamp_created": 1682639790,

In general terms, the game is a good proposal in horrr games, not the most scary game, but when you're into the history, you can't stop playing.\n\n2. One of the things that I love the most is the graphics of the game, that cartoon style in the 3d format is a good point of the whole game, just beautiful.\n\n3. When it comes to gameplay, the game doesn't feel repetitive, all the chapters are different, making the game more enjoyable. The game is not made to make you bored of it, you'll feel the need to stay playing until you finish the game.\n\n4. The characters have a good history behind, are not boring or have common personalities.\n\n5. For the last point, the music, the settings for all the atmosphere and all that kind of stuff makes you more into the history.\n\n[b]The bad side:[/b]\n\n1. The bug IS FULL OF BUGS. In my adventure for collect all the achievement, I had several headaches after two of my games were deleted for no apparent reason.\n\n2. Not only did I encounter issues with autosave, but also with other bugs such as the infinite pause screen and the non-functional \"esc\" button. Specifically, in chapter five, I found myself locked in a room with no possible way to open the doors after loading the game.\n\n3. A lot of other minor bugs, not such a terrible thing but they can be annoying.\n\n[b]FINAL SCORE: 3.5/5 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2730\u2730 (If we take apart the bugs, I can honestly say It's a 4.5/5)[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1680706407, "timestamp_updated": 1680706958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136152094": {"recommendationid": "136152094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363776146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1673152021}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game!!

I dunno what to say so I'm just making a list of pros and cons.\n\nFirst, with the Cons:\n- Bugs, the game is kinda bugged, especially with save files, but nothing that bad, if it bugs or something, reinstalling the game or just restarting the game will fix the issue.\n- Combat system, yeah this is kinda bullcrap, it's just hitting the enemy, wait some 0.5 seconds, hitting the enemy again, and wait, and hitting the enemy, repeated til' it is dead.\n- Duration: 100% the game may take 30 hours or more, but the game itself, the 5 chapters, only will last like, 5-9 hours, so yeah, it is not very long, it is actually very short, but it is very enjoyable.\n- It is not that scary.. I mean, the game is fun and everything, but at least, only the first time is kinda scary, but only the first time, and even if we count the first time we play, it is not that scary tbh.\n\nNow the pros:\n- OST: The ost its not like \"I love hearing this\" type of ost, but it is more like \"this ost is so fitting with the ambient\" type of ost, its pretty well done.\n- Graphics and Art Style: The art style of this game is pretty unique, and the graphics, are well-looking, not the most beautiful game you will see, but it is far from being ugly.\n- Story: The story is well-written, many people seem to hate the bendy's story, but I think it is pretty much well-written, since the game's creator had the story written, since he created the chapter 1 of the game in Feb 10 of 2017.\n- Price: As I mentioned before, the game is kinda short, but the price at least on steam is pretty much fine, 20 dollars isn't as bad as you may think, and in some countrys (like mine) the game is like 10 dollars, so yeah, the price is pretty much fine.\n- 100% the game: Making all the achievements of this game is pretty fun, the only achievement I hated while 100% the game, was the soup achievement of the 3rd chapter, aside that, all the achievements were fun to get!\n\nConclusion.\nThe game is pretty fun, I don't think its scary for many people, but I think it is scary enough, and that the game is pretty much enjoyable, if you like horror games but short games, then Bendy And The Ink Machine might be a game for you buddy!", "timestamp_created": 1680496073, "timestamp_updated": 1680496149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135987861": {"recommendationid": "135987861", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228865116", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1686409546}, "language": "english", "review": "better than poppy playtime", "timestamp_created": 1680470011, "timestamp_updated": 1680470011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135987502": {"recommendationid": "135987502", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101201428", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 756, "last_played": 1684683034}, "language": "english", "review": "The game in and of itself is stunning.

The game is a twisted mix of whimsy and horror, with enough jump scares to make even the bravest player squeal like a cartoon mouse.\n\nThe graphics are spot-on, capturing the look and feel of vintage cartoons with a dark twist. The sound design is equally impressive, with creaking floors, screeching violins, and the constant drip-drip-drip of ink serving as the perfect backdrop to the game's spooky atmosphere.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix of puzzle-solving and stealth, with plenty of scares thrown in for good measure. You'll spend most of your time sneaking around the abandoned animation studio, trying to avoid the twisted ink creatures that lurk around every corner. And when you do get caught - well, let's just say you'll know it when you see it.\n\nBut the real star of the show here is Bendy himself. This ink-based monstrosity is equal parts adorable and terrifying, with his wide grin and soulless eyes. He's like Mickey Mouse's evil twin - if Mickey Mouse was into satanic rituals and had a taste for human flesh, that is.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a game that will make you jump, scream, and maybe even laugh a little, Bendy and the Ink Machine is definitely worth checking out.

This isn't a bad thing, and it excels at what it sets out to do.\n\nThe atmosphere is broody and the art design is captivating. Enemy designs aren't scary, but I still really liked them, my favourite being The Projectionist. The game has some decently intense moments with some really good sound design, but the best moments are spent listening to the audio logs, unravelling the lore and just getting lost in the massive expanse of the old studio's puzzles and secrets.\n\nCharacters in this game are surprisingly good. BATIM is well written, delivering a solid plot about the \"new age\" of film and how it changed the industry and affected animation studios. I can't wait to play The Dark Revival and see how it ties into this game's story.\n\nBendy and the Ink Machine is good. Some consider this to be \"baby's first horror game\" and I can see that, (imo that's Little Nightmares, but to each their own), however, I came for the stellar art direction and narrative and BATIM sure as hell delivered.\n\n8/10\n\nBoris deserved better and i miss him.", "timestamp_created": 1680206935, "timestamp_updated": 1680206935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593881845474243164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135725241": {"recommendationid": "135725241", "author": {"steamid": "76561199343744991", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 852, "last_played": 1698524903}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good.

Each chapter has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, which I'll go into detail in later. First off I wanna go over some of the game's universal pros and cons.\nFor starters; the entire game has a wonderful aesthetic, bringing one of the most unique art styles to horror gaming. The enemies walk a fine line between charming and creepy, somehow finding a great balance between the two. The worldbuilding is simply incredible as well. This game is so full of secrets that it offers a ton of replayability to find everything.\nMy two biggest issues with the overall gameplay were the slow movement speed and overall weak weapons.\nWith the overalls out of the way; now it's time to go in depth with each chapter.\n\nChapter 1. Despite being monotonous at times; serves as a decent introduction to the world and the stakes at hand. The main quest of this level is pretty simple, and aside from one chase sequence is completely devoid of enemies; though the chapter still manages to provide an unsettling atmosphere. More or less a prelude to the hell you've wandered into. A hell that gets expanded upon in...\n\nChapter 2. The stakes get higher as we venture deeper into Joey Drew Studios. This chapter definitely ups the ante with several waves of enemies that must be defeated; along with a final chase sequence akin to the first chapter. However, it does feel that Sammy Lawrence was a little underused as an antagonist. This chapter manages to balance its tense and scary moments with a few well-placed humorous ones in a way that doesn't feel like tonal whiplash. It's easy enough to figure out the chapter's various puzzles; though the first time I played, the final chase took some trial and error. All in all, a very solid chapter that builds on the first one, as well as sets up...\n\nChapter 3. I played the game twice before penning this review; and the biggest differences in my two playthroughs were in this chapter. I will say this is one of the more hit-or-miss chapters of the game; as the whole chapter is built around doing a series of fetch quests for Alice Angel, while attempting to evade the Butcher Gang; both of these parties making their first appearance in this chapter. Bendy himself MAY also show up. During my first playthrough I didn't encounter Bendy at all in this chapter; but during my second run he showed up a fair amount of times. It is during this chapter especially where the weak weapons really begin to pose a problem. This goes ESPECIALLY for the syringe; which is honestly one of the weakest weapons I think I've ever seen in a game. The pipe doesn't fare much better. The axe is okay; though even with that, enemies like the Projectionist and the Butcher Gang themselves are still massive damage sponges. The actual fetch quests themselves felt quite boring without Bendy's interference the first time around. When he finally did decide to show up during my second playthrough he did give me more of a challenge; forcing me to find a hiding spot since he can't be killed. This chapter also does provide some of the most striking imagery of the whole game.\n\nChapter 4. This chapter really ratchets up the creep factor in the early stages with some truly scary scripted events early on. The setting of an amusement park warehouse is cool; though having the carnival minigames as mandatory to progress ranged from creative to rage-inducing. Specifically; the milk toss was probably the most infuriating thing in this entire game. I really enjoyed Bertrum's boss fight; though the Projectionist didn't add anything from his first appearance. The final boss fight with Brute Boris was fairly difficult the first time around; but once you figure out what to do for each stage it's actually rather easy.\n\nChapter 5. The final chapter of the game has some of its best and worst segments. The spyglass was a neat touch; with its [spoiler] ability to see previously hidden messages [/spoiler] adding instant replay value since [spoiler] it can be used in all previous chapters too [/spoiler]. The boat section frankly sucks; between having to hold down the throttle and constantly destroy debris in the paddlewheel it was one of the most monotonous sections of gameplay overall. What follows it is a constant barrage of enemies; one that just keeps spawning in an endless and overwhelming slogfest until the game arbitrarily decides to cease. After it is a maze section, followed by the final confrontation with Bendy's twisted form. The final boss fight is easy enough to figure out; and once it's done you're greeted with quite a potent ending. I won't spoil it.\n\nTl;dr BATIM has its share of highs and lows, but overall was a very enjoyable game that I'd highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1679231913, "timestamp_updated": 1679231913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656856417655944824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134963452": {"recommendationid": "134963452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197290903", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1679299826}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is great, love the theme and all that.

But the rest is just agressively mediocre, sometimes terribly basic. I don't think i'm asking too much to a \"little\" indie horror game here. Boring and insipid experience. Unlike what it seems, this is mostly Amnesia x Bioshock x early Disney gone wrong. It's more than just classic stealth+horror, and not for the better.\n\n-Moving is painful: walk/sprint are much too slow, animations make it even worse.\n\n-Incredibly archaic stealth and combat. You'll spent more time hitting monsters than actually running away from them. And when that happens, you just have to hide in one of the cabinets scattered around the levels. You can do it right under your foe's nose. He won't care and will leave you alone. There's no real challenge, no real threat. Definitely not scary.\n\n-\"\"Puzzles\"\" are hardly puzzles. The gameplay usually involves going into a room, picking stuff, using stuff on obvious designated machine. Everything feels artificial. Bendy failed to keep immersed, it was constantly reminding me that it's a video game and that i had to do errands for it. One protagonist even go as far as calling you [i]\"little errand boy\"[/i]. It's almost like they're self aware... \n\nI could probably recommend it solely on the basis of the artistic direction if it wasn't for a save bug i just had. I found out the game didn't properly save my progress, and that i had to go through another god awful chapter and fight some god awful boss AGAIN.  No way i'm doing this again. Other people had the same issue and i don't think the devs intend to fix it after 6 years. Never had that kind of severe problem before, even with 25yo games.

rly clicked in the third chapter, which is a showcase for some of the games biggest weaknesses (not being able to interact with a thing that seems intractable until the game Says So never stops being irritating, the combat doesnt have any real Options, the repetitive fetch quest structure [tho it is at least a bit compellingly Ritualistic]) but also just goes super hard on its environment and fleeting glimpses of moderately colorful characters. its Cool To Exist In, and the procedural presence of the ink demon/showdown with the projectionist are absolutely the most compelling horror in the whole thing that shit kinda fucked me up! none of the other chapters were that vivid to exist in for me, tho each of them has at least something that captured my imagination (again usually environmental) and some clearly lovingly crafted flourishes\n\nmost of what it has to offer is inoffensive first person adventure game stuff that just happen to be the way u interact with these rickety sticky cold nighty spaces (the ink itself somehow stays vivid as an environmental touch the entire time, i was Always subconsciously avoiding the places it spills from the ceiling), but the

For the first 2 chapters, it at least felt like it knew what it wanted to be, and although it was clear the game wasn't high budget and wore its influences on its sleeve, it had something to offer and I was immersed. Then the next 3 chapters happen.\n\nThrough every chapter we are introduced to multiple new mechanics, that are either very poorly designed and integrated into the story, serving very little purpose, or are pretty much immediately forgotten about and underutilised. The game feels very much like the devs said \"Wouldn't this be cool?\" and just added it into the game with not all that much forethought. Originally, it seems to play like a survival horror game...and then it sort of turns into a boss-rush with awfully designed bosses and combat mechanics. \n\nThe story also takes a very quick nose dive, it pulls you in pretty well in the first couple chapters but as the story unfolds it becomes incredibly apparent how shallow and underdeveloped these characters are. You learn very little about Henry the main character. You really have no reason to care about him, why he's there, or what his relationship was with Joey Drew. And as a villain, Joey Drew is incredibly underwritten and his motivations are boring. I would not be so nitpicky with the story, had the gameplay been interesting or enjoyable in any facet but I found myself often STRUGGLING to push myself through the last 2 chapters because the combat and 'stealth' were excruciating to get through. And so with the story being the only prop, its incredibly disappointing to see characters like Alice be thrown to the wayside or used as a deus ex machina.\n\nThis game is living proof that a concept or art direction do not make a good game, and its a shame that it came out the way it did considering the concept. If it had just stuck to one genre and really honed in on a FEW game mechanics rather than just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks every chapter, it could've been something special. I think the stealth should've been developed further particularly. \n\nI hope the second game is planned out better in some capacity, and figures out what it wants to be. I think Bendy and the Ink Machine blowing up during its first one or two chapters being released was to its detriment, and I hope the devs took the time between games to fully realise their vision.\n\n3/10", "timestamp_created": 1678234150, "timestamp_updated": 1678234150, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

However, as a Bioshock lover, this wasn't exactly a bad thing for me, but the story itself seemed a little underdeveloped to the point where it felt like the whole BioShock aspect was all it had going for it apart from some very nice character models. I often found myself wondering what was going on, with the 'current objective' being dumbed down to the point where it also didn't help whatsoever. I did enjoy many of the game's smaller aspects such as the mini carnival in chapter 3 or 4? idk, as well as just small things like the squeaking bendy dolls and cut outs. However much larger aspects were very annoying such as the game feeling very unbalanced with the whole constantly losing your weapon, to the boris fight being harder than the final fight with bendy, somehow getting a tommy gun ? as well as the random achievement to get more kills than alice and tom in chapter 4 or 5 idk anymore, which was incredibly hard granted if you died there was no chance you'd get it so you'd have to restart, which as a achievement hunter is very annoying.", "timestamp_created": 1677871880, "timestamp_updated": 1677871880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133962293": {"recommendationid": "133962293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062865304", "num_games_owned": 889, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1615988026}, "language": "english", "review": "What a waste of time, such a boring story", "timestamp_created": 1677831267, "timestamp_updated": 1677831267, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540455162525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133960169": {"recommendationid": "133960169", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091136865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 452, "last_played": 1677826965}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game the tommy gun is fun cant wait to make 30 dollars for 2nd epic bendy game\n", "timestamp_created": 1677827132, "timestamp_updated": 1677827132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133956353": {"recommendationid": "133956353", "author": {"steamid": "76561199465688826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1689553897}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1677820016, "timestamp_updated": 1677820016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133949538": {"recommendationid": "133949538", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004662979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1699231017}, "language": "english", "review": "i luv dis game <3", "timestamp_created": 1677808597, "timestamp_updated": 1677808597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133896944": {"recommendationid": "133896944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314525078", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1902, "last_played": 1686993812}, "language": "english", "review": "incredible game ruined my life 0/10", "timestamp_created": 1677729787, "timestamp_updated": 1677729787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133879265": {"recommendationid": "133879265", "author": {"steamid": "76561199444431112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 382, "last_played": 1686267554}, "language": "english", "review": "UJ", "timestamp_created": 1677702683, "timestamp_updated": 1677702683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133872171": {"recommendationid": "133872171", "author": {"steamid": "76561199187477666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1668863793}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello, just wanted to put my helpful advice if you ever think about downloading this game.

However, Chapter 3 was when my problems started: First, the game will randomly decide to stop actually saving your progress even when you manually save, meaning the only way to guarantee that a real save has triggered is to exit out of the game after saving and starting it up again at that specific save. Annoying but not unbearable, happened to me in Chapter 2 so my progress to Chapter 3 had to be redone. I get to Chapter 3 making sure my save files are working, but woops turns out if you save after taking the elevator in Chapter 3 and close the game it soft locks you so you cannot progress when you start again. OK, no big deal I'll just redo Chapter 3 and save after the required event takes place instead. So I get that done, and woops turns out if you save and close the game after the required event it soft locks you again. I cannot continue playing a game that soft locks like this and also doesn't reliably save your progress; takes the fun out of a game when you don't know when you're going to have to replay huge sections of it.

Like, the main character's motivations don't look very deep, and the antagonists are just edgy demon cartoons. There might be something more explicited later in the game, but for what I had the patience to play it all seems very plain and basic.\n\n\u274c The gameplay is a huge drag. Most of the time you're following unclear indications that lead you to crawl through big levels again and again to find unnoticeable objects, without any indication that you're following the right lead before you find the thing you're looking for. Again and again I found myself looking for walkthroughs online to help me find the stuff I am looking for, or even make sure I understood the hints right, and honestly spending so much time on wikis is kinda ruining the ambience.\n\u274c It was bearable, barely, but bearable until I hit a part where you have to look for items through a sprawling level, way larger than anything I had to face until now, with a constant menace chasing me into hiding places repeatedly, to avoid which you have no other choice than to wait. That's what made me give up the game - it was annoying until then, but from that point it became simply unplayable for me.\n\u274c The controls cannot be changed at all.

I really do. It does so much right. It's great, even. But there are some fundamental flaws that make it absolutely infuriating and I can't believe haven't been fixed since it's been released.\n\nI write this while I wait through the chapter 5 cut scene for the 5th time. This was after playing chapter 3 5 times and chapter 4 3 times because the save system is absolutely broken. I was going for 100% achievements, yes, so I expected to play a couple chapters a few times, but the reason why I had to was not what I was expecting. The game literally bugs and doesn't save your progress a LOT. If you notice Bendy in the bottom right, you better quit the whole game and reload, otherwise if you quit and reload the game later all your progress is just gone. I lost two and a half chapters to this, and I almost gave up on the game then. I persevered and replayed since the achievements stuck and I knew exactly what to do, but the fact that a game that has been out this long still has these glitches is unforgivable. \n\n                     \nOverall I really want to like this game, but after spending 10 hours and almost half of that was replaying parts I had already played, not because I was  100%ing it, but because the game is broken, I have a hard time recommending it.

There is also a fascinating storyline which is not certain during the game so u can make theories. There is a lot of collectibles to collect and achievements to get which is fun.

VR REVIEW![/h1]\n\nYou can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/-0LOclQHGec\n\nYes, you can now play Bendy and the Ink Machine in full, glorious VR thanks to Team Beef. All you need to play it is download the free VR mod from the github of Team Beef, unzip the file, and run the executable. This is one of the easiest VR mods to install. Even a complete noob can do it. Just make sure you have Bendy and the Ink Machine installed (you do need to have a purchased copy) and have your VR headset ready.\n\nBendy and the Ink Machine VR is absolutely the best way to experience Bendy and the Ink Machine. The visuals & sounds are excellent. You are totally immersed in this ink world. The VR interactions are not the best, but considering this is a port of a non-VR game, that's to be expected. Most of the VR interactions are of the point and click variety. There are some other basic VR interactions like swinging your melee weapon or carrying your flashlight, but again, these are very basic.\n\nGame is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting mostly 90 fps, although I did have some frame rate drops at times (down to 45 fps). You do have full locomotion, smooth or snap turning (you can set degree or speed of turn). You can play this game comfortably seated. \n\nAnyways, I hope more non-VR games get VR mods. I think it is a win-win for everyone involved. A big thank you to Team Beef for their hard work in making this mod and for making it free to the PCVR community. \n\n[b]VR Rating 8/10.[/b]\n\n[quote]If you enjoyed my review, please consider joining my Steam Curator Group.

The point of saving is so you can come back later, but you have to be prepared to play this game all in 1 sitting.", "timestamp_created": 1673675593, "timestamp_updated": 1673675593, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130798408": {"recommendationid": "130798408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802259137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 449, "last_played": 1696563385}, "language": "english", "review": "mmm bacon soup", "timestamp_created": 1673662241, "timestamp_updated": 1673756010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130794573": {"recommendationid": "130794573", "author": {"steamid": "76561199176524863", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1131, "last_played": 1690162723}, "language": "english", "review": "They made Sammy too Hot.", "timestamp_created": 1673656822, "timestamp_updated": 1673656822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130790717": {"recommendationid": "130790717", "author": {"steamid": "76561199226868215", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1675534125}, "language": "english", "review": "game", "timestamp_created": 1673651342, "timestamp_updated": 1673651342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130780620": {"recommendationid": "130780620", "author": {"steamid": "76561199260774598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 820, "last_played": 1694869825}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a fun horror and puzzle game.

Even though it started off fairly weakly in Chapter 1, it soon picked up, and you can really see the effect that the extra funding had on the following chapters in terms of graphics and quality, story, characters and overall story development. The style itself is very unique, and the lore behind it is fascinating, very well developed and very complimentary of the scenery. However, no game is perfect, and there were a few issues that I encountered in terms of bugs and glitches. The game clearly is not finished, and the developers pretty much abandoned it after combining all the chapters into one whole game. The bugs were frustrating at times, especially when I reached Chapter 4 and the last item I collected didn't trigger a voice line, which would've allowed me to progress further into the game, so I was stuck, with no way of moving forward. The only way to solve this was to start all over again... Surprisingly, it didn't take me long to get back to where I was. Other glitches included the game save not working, therefore progress not being saved, and also when you come back after being killed, the game puts you past the part you were at when you died, which defeats the point in you actually having to fight enemies. With all this in mind, I would still recommend this game to people who have a lot of patience. It's not a bad game by any means, it is incredible, it's just a shame that the bugs will never be fixed, because it takes away from the overall enjoyment of the game.

fiddle with an elevator, ride back to the floor i had just come from, and the game re-triggered dialogue and updated the objective-- then the escort NPC got trapped in the elevator, preventing the objecive door from opening until I went back and \"released them\".\n\nI've also had hostile enemies get stuck running into walls, defeating a stealth/horror sequence.\n\nThe worst was completing a series of boss fights in Chapter 4, then having the game freeze in a Chapter 5 cutscene and revert my save back before the (tedious) boss fight.\n\nAt this point I'll probably just watch it on

I now officially hate Bacon Soup!\n\n I also want to point out the unlockable \"Black and White Filter\" quest in this game is also neigh impossible without hacking the game because of all the issues I mentioned previously plus not being allowed to die since the game saves after deaths to keep track of every time you die and you have to do it in one go on one save file without reloading the game.. it's just so cruel and ultimately not worth it, better off switching your PC to black and white mode for that filter instead..\n\n This game is such a love hate relationship, it's a literal cartoon purgatory, a hellscape, not just intentionally but also to try and play through! I cannot recommend this game to anyone, even when it's on sale.. hoping it's official sequel Dark Revival is more playable at least as I do love this franchise and the new game almost didn't come out at all, glad the company is still around but hope that they've learned from their mistakes on their future projects, this game has been abandoned and the studio behind it almost went away for good..", "timestamp_created": 1673405532, "timestamp_updated": 1673405532, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539212584495544434", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130608860": {"recommendationid": "130608860", "author": {"steamid": "76561199001592811", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1696647719}, "language": "english", "review": "nvm i was jst stupid", "timestamp_created": 1673404261, "timestamp_updated": 1696648667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130608142": {"recommendationid": "130608142", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970484624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1673400929}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this with VR mod.

And there is a lot to like, however there are some game breaking bugs that just colossally ruined the experience for me.\n\nThe good:\n* The story: interesting and arguably quite different. It will grip a lot of people wanting to find out what is happening at the animation studio and with plenty Bends and turns this game will keep you in it for its run time (which arguably is not that long but we will get to that).\n* The graphics: whilst not astounding by any means in terms of realism, the graphics fit the game so perfectly and is a large part of the world building.\n* Replayability: Whilst this game seems like something you realistically wouldnt want to replay, there is a very interesting twist at one point of the game, that may make you interested in replaying it. I see this as a great thing especially when this is quite uncharacteristic for a horror game.\n\nThe meh/ok:\n*The atmosphere: This game had so much potential! The 1st chapter of the game did so well in terms of atmosphere. Shortly, the first chapter was something along the lines of if bioshock and amnesia the dark descent had a baby, but it was in black and white. You are left eerily uneasy as you traverse the level. The subtle jumpscares so tastefully placed in key locations... It was all so great. Why did I include it in the meh/ok section? Well... after the 1st half of the 2nd chapter all of that mystery and atmosphere starts fading away... and just keeps fading away to the point where the game becomes not scary at all. It feels like this game could have been so much better if the approach to the 1st chapter was carried over. Sadly that is not the case.\n*The gameplay: Whilst the gameplay is not inherently bad, it does leave much to be desired. It follows some similar approaches to other puzzle games, but it doesn't really innovate on them. Whether its a fetch quest, sneaking around hostile (and this point completely not scary) monsters or just looking for things around the map. This gets old quite quickly and borders on becoming boring. The only thing saving this point from landing in the \"bad\" section is the fact that the game is not that long thus it doesn't really have enough time to get too tedious. Regardless though, the gameplay apart from a few key locations is (which were quite interesting) meh at best.\n*Game length: This game is probably no more than a 4 hour game. I've said this on my other reviews but Ill say it again - I prefer shorter but more \"concentrated\" games rather than a diluted mess. However, I know there are plenty of people that disagree with me on this and this game is really short. The game doesn't cost \u00a360, however at \u00a315 you may want to consider whether or not you can spend your money better if you want a longer game.\n\nThe bad:\n* Realistically, BATIM wouldn't really have any points that would make it into this section if not for.... the bugs.\nI wouldn't even normally penalise a game this much for having a bug here or there, but it really heavilly relies on the severity of the bugs and sadly, BATIM gets a fat F in this department.\nThe short of it is - I lost my save file twice between game sessions and I also got softlocked in areas twice (thus forcing me to replay the whole chapter). This is absolutely unacceptable for a game thats being sold as a finished product.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. And I mostly did. Whilst I wouldnt place it as high as some of the content creators I watched did, it was enjoyable. But having completely game breaking bugs like this killed the game for me and along with it this review.\nI refuse to mark this game positive until these bugs are fixed (and knowing that this is a 6 year old game at this point I doubt it will happen).\n\nTLDR:\nInteresting story, great visuals, amazing atmosphere (at least initially) but with the risk of encountering the above game breaking bugs that may force you to replay a significant portion of the game...\nI cannot in good conscience recommend this game, but if you're willing to risk losing your save file then give it a try.\nBeware the blinking save icon.", "timestamp_created": 1673398378, "timestamp_updated": 1673398719, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130604166": {"recommendationid": "130604166", "author": {"steamid": "76561199065456271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3124, "last_played": 1696980030}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!

Combat in this one is fairly easy but can get annoying at some points, Puzzles are also pretty easy\n\nChapter 3: 4/10, Didn't like it as much, First half started out ok, then delved into annoying and tedious fetch quests. Projectionist areas were kinda fun, Except for when you were looking for that one missing thing you can't find and you hear screaming & music coming from the other hall\n\nChapter 4: 5/10, Slightly better then Chapter 3, but painfully short. The ink things that create Items are a cool mechanic, especially when you have to use them for the final boss... Speaking of boss fights in this chapter.. The first one (Bertrum) is slightly a thorn to the side... Can be annoying until you beat him\n\nChapter 5: 6/10, It is a improvement from both Chapter 3 and 4, but it is not as good as Chapters 1 and 2. The NPC mechanic with Tom and Allison feels very poorly used, and seemingly only serves to aid you for the Lost Ones boss fight during the beginning of the chapter. The butcher gang segment down in the department area is extremely infuriating, because if you die.. You're forced to restart all over again (unless you already made a pipe already) to go all the way to that one hall, Get the ink blob, and somehow avoid them while worrying about how they could screw you over in the blink of an eye.. Onto the ending. It left me rather dissapointed then satisfied (Yes.. I know it was setting up Bendy and the Dark Revival.. But the ending felt off and last minute for some reason.) Overall, decent chapter. Lackluster ending.\n\nVISUALS 'N STUFF\n--------------------------------------------------------\nVisuals: 8/10, It is rather pretty being for a stylized indie game.. so pretty infact it might set your computer on fire\n\nMusic: 7/10, Decent. some are pretty good. (Like Drawn to Darkness and Reel Fear)\n\nGameplay: 5/10, Not really much to do then to wield weapons, pick up items.. Pull levers.. You get the idea.\n\nStory: 5/10, I really wanted to like the story, but quite frankly I'm divided on it. Chapters 1-2 had a intresting direction for the story to go to, Only for Chapter 5's ending to blow it last minute and offer a last minute rewrite that felt rather rushed and unnesserary.\n\nVoice Acting: 7/10, Henry's voice for some reason makes me wanna fall asleep\n\nAnd that's about it. 6/10 game.

I had seen it was highly rated so I just wanted to try something outside of my comfort zone and I toughed it out for about 4 hours, getting to the end of Chapter 4 at the boss battle - this boss battle was poorly designed, but I still got a good chunk through it but kept dying at certain parts as a result of the absolutely abysmal control system and couldn't dodge some of the boss's attacks and finally just said eff it. Time to uninstall. Hopefully this will be more enjoyable for some other folks, it's just not my cup of tea.

Uninstalled and redownloaded the game and the bug disappeared, so I'm now able to form a full opinion after completing the game. \n\nAs well, I played Poppy Playtime before Bendy, and I think that left me slightly disappointed here- In all fairness, Poppy Playtime probably pulled a lot of inspiration from this game since this came out first, but the similarities were too familiar for them to fully excite me. Moving along-\n\nThe story line is incredibly interesting. The jump scares are well-timed, the characters are made to look genuinely unnerving, the suspense is layered on incredibly thick, and the puzzles/bosses are a nice mixture of extremely frustrating/challenging and doable. It's immersive, keeps you suspended in disbelief, and leaves you wanting more. Already downloaded Bendy and the Dark Revival (: However, I almost feel like I can't remember it very well because of how fast paced and complex it is- which could be seen as positive or negative.\n\nDue to bug issues being entirely random (as I've heard/read), I would suggest buying this on sale. At the time I thought I was doomed to never progress in the game due to the bug, I was comforted knowing I only paid about five dollars for it. The bug doesn't effect everyone, but everyone who does get it experiences it on chapter 3, which is probably too far in the game for Steam to accept a refund.

I saved multiple times and closed the game about 20-30 minutes from the end and lost all progress, ended up just watching the finale of the game\n\nAdditionally while the art direction was great, the plot never quite panned out in a way that felt satisfying. It had cool lore dumps throughout, but the ending was extremely cliche tbh. the mid section of \"Do 5 fetch quests for me while I taunt you about it\" almost had me quit, but I kept on hoping for a plot that never really went anywhere.

The first hour had me extremely interested but this game really just goes nowhere, failing to hit either creatively or emotionally\n\nTLDR\nPros: exceptional art and sound design, really good bioshock

Whilst this game does revolve quite a lot around puzzles, it doesn't take it too far and every puzzle can be solved within a few minutes so you're always having fun instead of angrily searching for the walkthrough. \n\nThe only issues with this game are the occasional scripting problem, and the save system. Every now and then you'll encounter a script problem when the game hasn't triggered the next event, but since the game is 5 years old at this point if you search you'll find the solution.  The save system is also a bit flaky, as in sometimes it just doesn't save and the Bendy icon gets stuck in the corner. \n\nOverall, very excited to get the 100% in this and pick up the sequel.

My family has owned it on the Xbox for many years and I never get bored with it. It has only one ending that I am aware of, but this does not disuade my urge to play the game over and over.\n\nIt has excellent graphics (this may hinder laptop gaming, as I discovered, but oftentimes altering the resolution and quality will solve this issue) and a fascinating story. The thoughtful character designs and intricate scenery add to its spooky mystique. I also adore the soundtrack. There are lots of puzzles; they are not too difficult so I recommend playing without a guide unless you wish to attain the Tommy gun.\n\nThe game\u2019s jumpscares still startle me when I play it, but some elements are silly. How close you have to get to the Bendy cutout in the first chapter (to hear the \u201cWho put this here?\u201d dialogue) is always funny, as are Sammy\u2019s monologues. Despite its fantastic quality, it\u2019s rather short and has only one ending (I believe it would work well with at least two; such as the Angel and Demon ending).

The visual style is really cool and I loved that.\n\nI was on Chapter 2 though and it got tedious.  What I could tell were supposed to be jump scares really were not scary and did not make me jump.  I was kind of getting bored.  I like the idea of this ink machine and what not, but I just wasn't creep'd out by the story or visuals.\n\nYou move slow, like in most games like this.  And that would be OK.  The environments are small enough where its not too tedious to go back and forth BUT then you have the \"combat\".  I hate when a good game (in my opinion of course) has to cram in some kind of \"survival horror\" aspect thinking it is scary.  The Ax you get for a weapon is slow, clunky and I swear has a negative range.  The Ink Monsters had to be on top of me for me to hit them.  for me personally I get more annoyed at this kind of mechanic, it breaks my immersion and makes me focus on a clunky combat system.  Its not scary, its frustrating I am not given the means to take care of these ink creatures (which to me aren't that scary either).  I get that to some people, that is how they enjoy games, struggling at every encounter.  But I wanted to immerse myself in the world and hear its story, not struggle to ax a few monsters.\n\nI gave up when I was on a certain \"puzzle\" where I had to get an ink monster to stand somewhere.  I kept trying, even reading guides.  Most people had no problem, three times they said and the monster stood where it needed to.  It never did, it switched between four spots in the room and that was it.  I was at it for probably 20 minutes or so.  I tried to reload the game and it never stood where it needed to.  One of the spots it stood was close but the trap didn't work.  So I am only left to assume its glitched and the one spot near the trap is supposed to be under the trap.\n\nI returned it, I feared it would try to shoe horn the \"survival\" element in instead of being atmospheric.  I personally just don't like that element in horror games, I don't find it scary myself, I find it annoying.  And left to assume I cant advance due to a glitch (no solutions online, none in game either) I just could not play it anymore.", "timestamp_created": 1672068885, "timestamp_updated": 1672068885, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129344223": {"recommendationid": "129344223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007126072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1672335455}, "language": "english", "review": "Two big problems: 1) Broken save system. 2) You are little more than an errand boy.

From the very beginning, it becomes evident that the game fails to deliver on its promise of delivering scares. While there are a few jump scares sprinkled throughout, they lack impact and quickly fade into oblivion. Moreover, the story itself is devoid of purpose and lacks a satisfying conclusion. No matter how many theories you entertain, they cannot salvage the haphazard narrative structure that leaves players seeking closure.\n\nRegrettably, this game falls into the realm of sheer absurdity. It had the potential to be something extraordinary, but it falters on multiple fronts. Bendy, the proclaimed threat, is frequently neglected for extended periods, as the game's focus shifts to the unimpressive Evil Alice. Her chapter is marred by tedious fetch quests that could have been reimagined to highlight Bendy's presence and feature the Projectionist as the sole character to elicit fear. The inclusion of Good Alice and Boris feels forced and inconsequential. They briefly aid the player in an unfairly challenging battle, only to vanish and reappear for the sake of comedic relief. Ultimately, their presence adds little value to the overall experience.\n\nThe final battle serves no purpose and diminishes the sole redeeming factor of the game\u2014the unique design of Bendy. Disappointingly, this design is discarded in favor of a more brutish form, leaving players to suspect that it was abandoned for a superior iteration in the sequel.\n\nThe game is riddled with numerous glitches that severely hinder the enjoyment. Personally, I encountered difficulties accessing the archives and had to resort to manipulating files to unlock them and obtain an achievement. Chapter 5 presented an insurmountable obstacle as I found myself trapped between two unyielding doors, rendering progress impossible. Despite the game saving my location, it failed to register my actions, leaving me in an inescapable predicament.\n\nRegarding the story, it is an incomprehensible mess. While it hints at a purgatorial setting, there is no coherent connection established between the player character and Bendy, apart from vague allusions to the player being Bendy's creator. The motivations driving Bendy's desire to kill the player character remain shrouded in ambiguity. The game attempts to delve into Evil Alice's backstory, but it is overshadowed by her theft of Boris, undermining any potential for depth. Intriguing concepts are merely brushed upon and left unexplored. The game relies excessively on audio tapes to convey emotions, neglecting the need for substantial storytelling. Surprisingly, the most development is dedicated to Joey Drew, an unremarkable character whose fa\u00e7ade is revealed through a single tape. Boris, on the other hand, is a forgettable presence who merely serves to rescue the player. One of the incarnations of Boris unexplainably harbors animosity towards the player character. Sammy, a character who seemingly perished in Chapter 2, inexplicably resurfaces in later chapters. The lack of compelling character development and narrative depth leaves players bewildered as they traverse the studio, questioning the game's direction.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there are brief sections of sneaking that are best hurried through rather than meticulously navigated. The absence of consequences for failure indicates that the developers themselves recognized the flaws in these sections but opted to include them regardless.

dead didnt die and i think thats one of the issues theres no reason to have that in the game they made one of the chapters easier in an update making you have no reason to use one of the major mechanics and in one of the updates they bugged the game and to this day its never been fixed and with the sequel out were left with a mess of a game that has no reason to be played and thats why i think this game is bad theres so much wrong with it id like to talk about a ton of nitpicks i have with this game. chapter 3 has a bug where the game stops saving and it can continue into other chapters where it doesnt save and you can lose hours of progress. in the switch port which i owned at one point chapter 5 would just crash and youd have to do a whole boss again over and over cause i

So you stumble upon the Ink Machine, this giant machine intended in bringing cartoon characters to life. So you find the main power switch and you find out you need to put items on the pedestals to \"appease the gods\" as Joey says according to Wally Franks, but once all are collected you place them on the pedestals and you need to find a valve to restore the ink pressure, once this is done you head back and flip the switch and on turns the machine, you head over to the ink machine and find the room is boarded up. In curiosity you walk up to it to see what's inside and you get a jump-scare from the Ink Demon himself and so he chases you and you dash for the exit but before you can get to it, the wooden boards beneath you arent steady enough so you fall through them into this pool of ink of which you have to drain using the valves found around the area, once this is all done you find a workstation with an axe. You take it then start chopping down some boards and find yourself in this room with a big sacrificial pentagram. Upon stepping onto it you start having these flashbacks showing things like a wheelchair, the Ink Demon, the Ink Machine and others.\n\n| Conclusion to chapter 1 |\n\nIn conclusion chapter 1 is a very well done way to start an amazing horror game and story, would recommend getting the demo before paying for the full game because you still get the same experience no matter if you get chapter 1 for free or you get it with the full game, that is if it costs money at all for the first chapter.\n\n( I'll maybe do the other chapters soon )", "timestamp_created": 1671109733, "timestamp_updated": 1671109733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128583622": {"recommendationid": "128583622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839747751", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1692940098}, "language": "english", "review": "JOHNNYCHOU\n", "timestamp_created": 1671076575, "timestamp_updated": 1671076575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128577111": {"recommendationid": "128577111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198829365370", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 718, "last_played": 1671068710}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, I slept on this game for years.

On one hand, I would say that I had a fairly good time with it. But on the other hand, some of the things you have to do in order to get any of the cool stuff is the hugest fucking hassle and there are way better games you could get for less than the asking price of this one. A lot of your time with this game(If you want to go %100 which if you don't the game is like 6 hours) will be playing through areas over and over again trying to activate easter eggs that are no where near worth you're time. I recently tried to go for the secret weapon in chapter 5 and have played through nearly all of chapter 1-3 at least 3 times now trying to get it. I'm not against cool easter eggs that are hard to get. But with this game the easter eggs aren't even hard to get. They're just tedious. And when a game asks the world from you, I believe you should expect the world from the game, and BATIM certainly does not do that. The game is littered with tons of annoying bugs(Especially with how saves work). Despite all these hiccups though, I do believe that there is a base here for a very good game. And it's recently released sequel, BATDR proves that. There also some really cool moments every now and then. If I had to review every chapter individually it would go like this(this is where I get into vague spoilers so watch out):\n\nChapter 1: 6/10, pretty cool for what it's worth. A neat tutorial to the basics of the game.\n\nChapter 2: 8/10, probably would've been my favorite chapter if it had some cool boss battles like in the other chapters.\n\nChapter 3:  7/10, when it's good it's really good. When it's bad it's really bad. Has some of the coolest easter eggs in the whole game. However, you will need a precise guide, multiple playthroughs of the chapter, and a shit ton of luck that the game doesn't break to find them all. Has two very cool boss fights.\n\nChapter 4: 9/10, my favorite chapter. Only gripes I have with it is that I don't believe it used the amusement park themed it goes for as well as it could've. You don't get to explore the remains of an amusement park, you get to explore a warehouse with shit from an amusement park. Also not all that many cool easter eggs.\n\nChapter 5: 7/10, pretty good. No big easter eggs besides like 1 and the bosses are a little underwhelming(but they're still kinda fun). It also had a really weird ending that only works if you plays its sequel that released years later. I think it was an effect of them trying to bite off way more than they could chew. They had way to many conflicts still hanging around for them to resolve in just one chapter. Feel like it would've been better if they just made the game a couple chapters longer since the ending was clearly not planned from the start anyway.\n\nIn conclusion, BATIM is pretty good game with quite a few issues. I'd say the game is best experienced with a couple of buds with a Saturday afternoon to kill while trying to find as much of the cool stuff as possible in the process. The big question you have to ask yourself with that is if it is worth the money for that. This game is $20 which is a very hard pill to swallow when you realize that the entire game series that this game is clearly inspired by(Bioshock) is $20 too and is way longer with an averaging length(without going %100) of about 12 hours(thanks howlongtobeat.com for the info!).", "timestamp_created": 1670631631, "timestamp_updated": 1670631631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128254627": {"recommendationid": "128254627", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004667146", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1273, "last_played": 1677887409}, "language": "english", "review": "did me a spook", "timestamp_created": 1670628487, "timestamp_updated": 1670628487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746846258640289307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128253484": {"recommendationid": "128253484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198978887720", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1668901479}, "language": "english", "review": "kinda boring, worth playing tho, lots of effort put into it", "timestamp_created": 1670626951, "timestamp_updated": 1670626951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128253071": {"recommendationid": "128253071", "author": {"steamid": "76561199084084089", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 306, "last_played": 1678063864}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1670626361, "timestamp_updated": 1670626361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128251631": {"recommendationid": "128251631", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091467084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1297, "last_played": 1670455688}, "language": "english", "review": "its good.", "timestamp_created": 1670624497, "timestamp_updated": 1670624497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128232568": {"recommendationid": "128232568", "author": {"steamid": "76561199258129265", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 852, "last_played": 1680738848}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1670601755, "timestamp_updated": 1670601755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128229550": {"recommendationid": "128229550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024466736", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 824, "last_played": 1699194141}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy divertido", "timestamp_created": 1670598377, "timestamp_updated": 1670598377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128209323": {"recommendationid": "128209323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345513641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1084, "last_played": 1670569852}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah it's really fun but slow paced.

Usually when I see large youtuber's digging into a game en mass, I get pretty sceptical. Thankfully, Bendy is at least a unique and engaging experience, but one with plenty of flaws.\n\nIt has an incredibly unique style that works in the horror game space quite well. I can veritably say there's nothing out there which looks quite like this game in the horror genre.\n\nThe music is also quite good for the most part and fits the aesthetic well. My only problem with it would be that it can be often be incredibly overbearing and obnoxious during some of the more intense horror sequences. It can feel like the game doesn't have enough confidence in the scares themselves and is instead trying to drown them out with symphony.\n\nGameplay wise, its your typical indie horror dish with more of a focus on light puzzles and fetch quests. You can definitely see when playing that the devs didn't want Bendy to be a walking sim, so they tried hard to include a lot of variety from chapter to chapter. While they do succeed in providing this variety, the mechanics themselves aren't always fleshed out. There is actually combat in Bendy, but it involves nothing more than just spamming your left mouse button on repeat, there's no finer mechanics here, just hit the enemies until they die. The puzzles themselves aren't really puzzles at all, its just getting items from one location and moving them to another to open up the next door on repeat. The longest a single puzzle ever took me was probably 5 minutes give or take, and I absolutely suck at puzzle games.\n\nAs for the horror part, like I said when referring to the music, Bendy lacks confidence. Most of the enemy designs with the exception of Bendy himself aren't all that intimidating. The game also loves to use jumpscares without buildup to try and scare you, which is really lame. Not to mention it does the FEAR 2 tactic of blasting the visuals with ugly filters during key moments to create a feeling of intensity when it didn't need to. The final boss is also really disappointing, dying doesn't really have much of a consequence and there's nothing in the way of challenge.\n\nThe primary thing that'll keep you going in Bendy is the mystery of the plot itself. Without spoiling anything, its a lot like Bioshock 1 or Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs in the way it focuses on the risks of ambition and man being consumed by his own creation. It was a great concept in those games and it works very well here too. The characters are also well built and interesting on top of this.\n\nOverall, its a fair indie horror experience with an intriguing world, story and characters. The gameplay flaws do bring it down a tad, but they're very fixable and I'm interested in playing the sequel to see how it improves upon this game.\n\nWhen all's said and done, its only just over 4 hours long and doesn't require much out of you.
