Superfluously it seems like a VN where you just need to click to coast from dialogue option to dialogue option and just test each conversation choice until you get the right combo to get to the right ending.\n\nTurns out it's a little more complex than that; there are icons on some of the screens that can be clicked to look at new stuff that gives new information, offering a little flavor text - and, more importantly, unlocking new dialogue that leads to a more optimistic route. \n\nStill, this discovery- and getting any use out of it- was limited for me to the phone screen, where you can click the Twitter icon - and may we please just praise that these absolute madlads had the guts to actually show *Twitter*, in their for-profit game, no parody name or icon or anything!? Major points, Akaba! We need more stones like this in public media publishers - to see the leading lady's profile to see a bit of her personality and unlock a movie option that she'll actually get excited about (all the rest, she's apathetic to).\n\nOnce it got to what seems like the next scene where this is hinted to be possible - a split screen of the boy and the woman in their respective rooms - you can make some objects increase in size slightly by hovering over them, but clicking on them doesn't do anything; you just have to advance through the dialgoue the obvious way until they get to an anticlimactic \"I gotta go\", which leads you down the disfunctional ending.\n\nI did accidentally get them to start making content-specific speech bubbles about their things before that, once, but I haven't been able to replicate it - and the truth is, this sleepy little awkward \"love\" story doesn't really make me care enough to bother troubleshooting it, not when the option to refund and get some money back hovers overhead.\n\n___\n\nThis game is meant for people who really, *really* like awkward and disturbing romance sims, and for people who have the spare time -and interest - in a \"guess-and-check\" style for playing multiple-ending games. For such folk, maybe there's something here; that \"Overwhelmingly positive\" rating obviously comes from somewhere.\n\nBut for folks who prefer at least some clues to piece together to get to the right answer, make the right timing, and who frankly want an experience they can squeeze between sessions of working on their college essays, I definitely can't recommend this in good conscience. \n\n___\n\nStill, I for one am glad to see some Chinese developers actually getting a chance to spread their wings openly and to a warm welcome in a Western Market. I definitely encourage Akaba Studio to continue; I'm ready for some healing between Chinese and American cultures wherever it can happen, even if it has to be through something so niche and silly as indie games.", "timestamp_created": 1699731762, "timestamp_updated": 1699813827, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471064478158950806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149948075": {"recommendationid": "149948075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144316137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 96, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1699724395}, "language": "english", "review": "\u591a\u5e74\u4e86\u8fd8\u662f\u90a3\u4e48\u7684\u611f\u52a8  \n\u8c22\u8c22\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u7528\u5fc3", "timestamp_created": 1699724666, "timestamp_updated": 1699724666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149941581": {"recommendationid": "149941581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177286859", "num_games_owned": 864, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1699715080}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A Personal Journey with LoveChoice[/h1]\nLoveChoice, a game that might resonate differently with each player, holds a special place in my heart, especially for those who have had recent emotional experiences. While it may not have a universal appeal, I highly recommend giving it a chance.\n\n\n[h1]Why LoveChoice Impressed Me[/h1]\nThis game stands out with its clever use of game design elements, paired with straightforward storytelling that\u2019s both engaging and thought-provoking. The developers have skillfully balanced simplicity with depth, creating an experience that\u2019s subtly impactful. The second story, in particular, was a highlight for me. It weaves its narrative in a manner that\u2019s both intuitive and immersive, making every moment in the game feel significant and emotionally charged, and terribly realistic..\n\n\nI must also commend the developers for bringing their GameJam idea to life. Additionally, discovering that this game was released on my birthday added a personal layer of joy to my experience :)\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nLoveChoice transcends the boundaries of a mere game, evolving into an emotional journey that intertwines complexity and simplicity. Its masterful portrayal of the complexities of relationships strikes a chord. The game delves deep (enough) into the intricacies of human connections, exploring how choices and consequences weave the tapestry of our interactions. This exploration is both thought-provoking and poignant, challenging players to reflect on the nature of relationships and the delicate balance of effort and acceptance.\nThrough its interactive storytelling, LoveChoice highlights that not all fractures in relationships can be mended, and some truths are harder to face than others. This realization, though bittersweet, is a powerful takeaway from the game.

And yes, it does not cost much.\n+ The music and graphics are sweet and touching.\n+ Large language support.\n+ Short game focused on the core-experience.\n+ Mini-games discribe real-life situations surprisingly well.\n+ The game has nice lessons within the stories, that can be eye-opening. You need to think a bit, what could be the solution to a problem - BUT...\n\ncon:\n- ...the game does not tell you, that there is a problem anyway. It does not tell your options of acting. You have to lose every story, to know what is coming and to grind to success in the repeat of the game. That breaks the hole concept of a serious relationship-simulation for me and makes it feel like a soulslike - \"dying foreward\".\nIdea: A tutorial-story would be nice, that shows you, what the game expects as kind of game-controlls, for example: drawing your character from point a to b, very fast click-picking, searching pictures, concentration tests, NOT-clicking is same important as choosing correctly, profiling/stalking your mate, unexpected change of character, etc.\n\n- Not shown timer for actions. Often you have 5-10 seconds to act, without knowing.\n- Trying to find the solutions is tiring/exhausting.\n- Female rolemodel seem a bit very passive and quiet. Could be a character-trait, but is also a bit outdated. In an adult realtionship you learn to express your expectations on both sides - equally.

Depending on your choices and actions, the relation can either flop or continue on.\n\nLong Distance is similar to First Love except you are faced with trying to maintain a long-distance relationship. Once again, your choices and actions affect the outcome of this relationship.\n\nFinally, we have Detective which is about a wife trying to find out what her husband has been doing behind her back (it's not what you think). This mode is unique in that it's basically a mini point-and-click puzzle game.\n\nAnyway the game plays like a visual novel except for the fact that there are moments in the game where you really need to think outside of the box. For instance, you'd need to drag the boyfriend to the girlfriend in a moment. Another one is simply not pressing the dialogue button while the couple are trash-talking each other.

(ironic, isn't it?)\n\nThe name and the end credit song imply very well that, whenever you can, you must make a LoveChoice. And it is interesting that, mirroring life, the choices that are made through love are not the obvious one. This game plays with our gaming muscle memory in the sense that we are trained to interact the way that the game display prompts us very explicitly. And we've been playing games and pressing X when the HUD says so (even without reflection sometimes) for years. So it comes as a shock how hard we fail at building relationships while doing what we have been doing without effort or a second thought for years. But it would only make sense narratively that when we automatize our relationships, loving as one would push a button (without care, attention and reflection), they don't move forward. And that is precisely what the game invoked on me!\n\nThat's where this game's brilliance lies. The LoveChoice is not an obvious action, but it is attention to detail. Reading the room, understanding when to remain quiet, when to let go, when to not push the boundaries of trust. It invites us to stop engaging with the narrative as gamers and start engaging as caring people. And in that way, it's a puzzle game instead of a visual novel. Much like the way meeting new people is puzzling, and there is often a third choice not prompted in the dialogue options. \n\n It was really sweet, and i definitely recommend and will be keeping an eye on the Devs bc i loved their work (i suppose that's the LoveChoice I'm making now then).", "timestamp_created": 1682102449, "timestamp_updated": 1682102449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137053942": {"recommendationid": "137053942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185406174", "num_games_owned": 476, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1683209607}, "language": "english", "review": "why i always getting broke up ending :(", "timestamp_created": 1682084309, "timestamp_updated": 1682084309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137034190": {"recommendationid": "137034190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070503161", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1682044677}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe as someone who's been in an 8+ year relationship, dealing with the complexities of human emotion and nuanced communication, I found this game a little too... simplistic?

It is also a way to support the developer of this amazing game. There is no need for refund for this game. I might have completed the game, but I would love to play it again once more in the future.

So far, I've only completed the Love game (by repeating the same chapter for a better ending), and I must say, it hits you hard (not in a romantic way). I learned some valuable lessons from this game, and if you want to experience it for yourself, I highly recommend giving it a shot. The game features simple yet pleasant art and skillfully tugs at ones emotion to make the right choices. Additionally, it has a great soundtrack, challenging gameplay (which those who played the first chapter might relate to), and doesn't require high-end hardware.

For $1.50 you get 3 very sweet short stories, each with their own different lessons and takeaways (all of which are extremely relevant in real life). For me personally, the first story's takeaways are [spoiler] emotional awareness/empathy, listening, effort, reading the room, and not ever growing complacent. Also, the game reveals that the creator used that game to propose to her. Very emo moment, I was very teary. [/spoiler] The second story's takeaways are [spoiler] being considerate, that sometimes effort alone isn't enough, sometimes things are about timing, and sometimes having a relationship isn't necessarily the ultimate priority... and that's okay. [/spoiler] The third story's takeaways are [spoiler] trust, and once again, not ever growing complacent. [/spoiler] Of course, though, I think there are plenty of different things to take away for each individual. I recommend going in blind and trying to unlock all the achievements to get the different endings. The hints that are scattered within the text about what could have been different are enough as long as you actually think about them.\n\nThe best ending for the 3rd story hits really hard if you're in a relationship. Before the credits roll, [spoiler] it gives you the chance to enter your own names, and the game wishes you well in your own relationship. [/spoiler] It's very tastefully sweet and emotional.

After playing it over the course of 3 streams, this short game has proven itself as an innovative, insightful, and profound look into love an relationships. I'm going to put up front that if you like romance, are in a relationship, or are looking to be in a relationship, you will probably like this game, and should just buy / play it now to avoid any possible minor spoilers.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nLoveChoice is split into 3 subgames,\"Love.Game\", \"Love.Distance\", and \"Love.Detective\" each with their own self contained story. While, at first, LoveChoice seems to play like a typical visual novel, you come to find that having a successful relationship requires much more than trying to find the right reply from a list of canned responses. Each subgame is also unique in how it uses the gameplay to tell it's story. \"Love.Game\" plays more like a typical visual novel, \"Love.Distance\" plays like  a hidden object / spot the difference game, and \"Love.Detective\" plays like an escape room. But the thing that makes this game special is that if you coast along playing the game as you expect, you're not going to get the best endings. It's when you go above and beyond, breaking through the established norms of the genre, do you become a better lover, and get the good endings.\n\n[b]Art[/b]\n\nThe art is cute and nicely stylized, and the cgs make for wonderful desktop backgrounds which can be downloaded through the game itself. The music is nice but is never very remarkable outside of the song played during the credits\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nEach of the 3 stories feel extremely real, to the point where I legitimately thought some of them were retellings / expansions on events that happened in real life. Akaba Studio also manages to cover a wide range of emotions through it's storytelling, showing you the exciting beginnings of a relationship, the problems that arise, the complacency that can form. \"Love.Distance\" made me tear up by showcasing the bitter reality of sometimes needing to let go of the person you love the most. And \"Love.Detective\" made me tear up by showing one of the most romantic anniversary gifts I've seen.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\n\nIn it's 2 hr runtime LoveChoice made me smile, tear up, and reflect upon my own relationship. I found it's subversion of visual novel mechanics to be refreshing and also meaningful to the themes the game presents. I believe LoveChoice presents love in a way only that can only be experinced through the medium of video games.\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nLoveChoice is a beautiful look into relationships and can be enjoyed by couples, fans of romance, and just about anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1676189345, "timestamp_updated": 1676189345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509878456592559814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132687513": {"recommendationid": "132687513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111775525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1676188154}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute game, great art style and simplistic music.

PLEASE GIVE BLACKY A HEADPAT AND SAY HI TO HIM/HER FOR ME! <3\n\n2. Love will always touch you in mysterious ways, such as playing this game.

[/i]\n\nSimple really but it really struck a cord in me, sometimes giving generic replies and answers isn't always the case. You have to show it that you mean it. It surprised me when I could not just gave a reply back to the person, but actually interact with the moving background. It was so cute how it broke the 4th wall by making you not just give a reply in the text box but actually interacting with the environment making you an observant person.\n\nAs with how things goes too there's a moment in the Love \u00b7 Game, [spoiler]where you are arguing with your significant other you would assume and click on the dialogue insinuating you to bite back and get even more frustrated but really the correct thing was to let it go and cool off.[/spoiler] Just by not interacting back at all you really are doing the right thing.\n\nGenerally when it comes to visual novel-type games there really isn't much to say, you read, you click, you save rinse and repeat, but the twist in this visual novel is that you can either continue with the given prompts or interact with said background. Minor thing but it can puts things into perspective with you missing cues or whether or not you're supposed to ignore it.\n\nFor the story, I've completed all 3 mini-love stories that are included in this visual novel. Below are my thoughts.\n\nIn Love \u00b7 Game, I've loved every single aspect of it from the start to the end. How it was handled, how the characters interact and of course the endings I've gotten. Good or bad, they're both important valuable lessons that were taught here and there.\n\nIn Love \u00b7 Distance like it's in its name, distance can and will change a person. Without spoiling too much, time will inevitably change certain aspects of an relationship whether people agree or disagree. There are plenty of choices where you think you would've done or could've done but ultimately it is best if we go our own separate ways, to find what truly matters for yourself.\n\nIn Love \u00b7 Detective, I already went in with a raised eyebrow assuming as what the previous titles meant for it's story, and you would've guessed it is... detective work alright. I didn't know what I had in store for me when I realized.... sometimes choosing not to know is the right choice, not saying to be ignorant of the choice you made but choosing to believe your person.\n\nMusic is quite subjective, so from what I've listened it's generally fits the theme of this game and mood. When you first met, when you're talking, when you're arguing, when you're being sentimental. The simplicity of the melody brings out the best in what's happening currently. So, yes I do love the music, thank you MIDIPanda.\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy how the game is and I'm suuuuper satisfied and gave me tons of fuzzy warmth feelings in the inside.", "timestamp_created": 1674584099, "timestamp_updated": 1684427602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131465178": {"recommendationid": "131465178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085866976", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1674569438}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game a lot.

Something scripted in a way that either sets us up for a specific route in mind. Or something that's so wild beyond belief that it's easy for us to suspend our realities and play along in the fantasy world of the game. But that's just it, a game. But LoveChoice is more than just a game, it's... love actually. Love in a way that isn't always happy or isn't always perfect.\n\nGAME PLAY:\nI, like many others, played the first story and got broken up with. I didn't know why and I was thoroughly confused -- especially since the choices seem limited. It seems like you only have a few options, but after playing through it once I realized that the choices felt shallow. (minor spoiler) [spoiler] And in the end letter, the game tells you that to some extent [/spoiler]. I realized that there was something missing, something that didn't add up, and I realized that it's not at all as it seems. The first part has the most variances you can probably get and by testing out different ways to go about it, you'll be able to pick up on the rest of the game pretty easily -- but I will admit I was pretty challenged for a bit. I even succumbed to looking up the answers a few times. However, REMEMBER there's always another way (minor spoiler)[spoiler] until you get to the second story where I may be a liar[/spoiler].\n\nART:\nLet's start with the art, it's simplistic but meaningful. It isn't something that's intensely decorated like Heart Fragment or maybe even Our Life, but it is very cute and simplistic until you start digging a little deeper. It's good though because for the amount of solving that you (as the player) must do, it helps prevent any unnecessary distraction. The music is also soft and sweet, sometimes even bitter. It fits well with the story you follow along with.\n\nSTORY/PLOT:\nNow I'll talk about the stories - I'll try to be as vague as I can while providing solid content.\n\nStory 1 [spoiler] this story is the one with the most variances in how you play. Everything matters, and the game will try to help you a bit by showing you small prompts but realize that not everything is as it seems. I failed a few times before I even realized that there is a puzzle element and an interactive element to the game -- something besides just clicking on an scripted answer. I didn't even realize that the game was a puzzle (clearly someone did not read any tags) until I played it the 3rd time. That being said [/spoiler] PLAY IT MORE THAN 1 TIME. Like many other users here, this story not only teaches or reminds us about what love can be but how to have a healthy form of it. \n\nThat's the key isn't it? A healthy relationship with people? I'm sure everyone's heard of a toxic relationship or have been in one (friendships count just as much as romances!). It's hard to create and maintain if not everyone's on board. In fact, I'd argue that it's impossible to have a healthy relationship without everyone sacrificing a little bit of something. Even though the game play makes it seem obvious on what you should click on -- don't be afraid to think outside of the box. But play the game first however you feel is right, and let your results speak to you. Let them tell you exactly what went right or what went wrong. You don't have to have everything perfect and that's alright.\n\nWhat relationship is ever picture perfect?\n\nStory 2 As you can probably figure out, this story is about long distance. I''ll be completely transparent. I've never had a romantic partner drift away from me due to distance, but I've had loads of friends who have. Friends who I considered to be family at some point. It's hard trying to cling on to a friend who tries to cling on to you, but your lives are too dramatically different for you to be happy in that sort of friendship. I'm not saying that all friendships/relationships can't be happy, but I've found it to be very difficult if you've met the person and formed a relationship in real life and transitioning it to online. \n\n[Spoiler] The second story has the best bitter sweet plot. To some extent we know what will happen. We know the very real possibility of things not working out, but the optimist in us wants it to work out anyways. You'll feel the awkwardness, you'll feel the distance between the MC's (Grace and Stan in this story), and your heart will fracture just a bit because... No one wants to let go. I know I didn't want to let go, I know I never want to let someone so close to me go. You might feel different and that's totally okay, because you can let go. But I tried to keep it together until the end. [/Spoiler]\n\nRemember what I said about -- there's always another option? This game might make me a liar but you get to decide at the end of this story. This story line was the first one to really make me think about my own trauma and my own life experiences. Why did I choose specific actions knowing it might not work out? Why did I stay optimistic throughout the game? These questions didn't necessarily pop up during the 1st story for me, but jumped out in this one. It might be because I've figured out how to play the game but it also might be because this plot hits closer to home for me.\n\nThe moral of this story is still carried from the last, what make a healthy relationship 'healthy?' Even though we might not want to do something [spoiler] I know for me it's a trauma response [/spoiler] sometimes it's better to bite the bullet and 'just do it' as Nike says. Because at the end of the day, we have to love and have compassion for ourselves too.\n\nStory 3, again, triggers another trauma response (I'm trying not to use this term loosely but after going through some professional therapy -- trauma isn't defined as clearly as we may think so I think it's fitting in this context) from me even though I can masquerade it as curiosity. When we hear romance and detective -- we might hope for the game to be something like a mystery romance murder. But with the track record of the first two stories being so realistic, this one probably won't tangent too far away from that.\n\n[Spoiler] This plot makes you a detective, a super slooth, and an international super spy (not really). You'll understand right away as the story kicks off pretty quickly and has a knack for making you suspicious. [/spoiler] Unlike the other two, this one is much more linear. Once you pick a poison, you have it until the bitter end. It's really engaging because unlike the other two you get to roam around your apartment you share with your husband. It seems innocent enough, curiosity and all, but realistically why would anyone snoop around? What are we trying to find? This plot, since it's so much more linear, brings out our curiosities but also relates back to that ever important theme of 'healthy relationships.'\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll of these stories have their own special thing going about them, and while everyone will pick up different lessons that they want. It's undeniable that there is a massive emphasis on the question 'what makes a healthy relationship and what makes it toxic?' I think it's an important question to ask, because I certainly didn't know the difference for a while. In fact, I still probably have problems distinguishing between the two.

I played trying really hard to 100% the game and I loved every second of it. The game phenomenal in portraying falling in love and maintaining a healthy relationship, because of that the game was very relatable.\n\nPlaying the game at first I got the break-up ending, because I suck at reading into things and always take everything at face value. This game has made me realize how to be better at relationships. I did better on Love Distance as a result, but I still got the bad ending. The second playthrough I got a better ending, but it was still not the satisfactory outcome.\n\nNow the last ending of Love Distance, the whole reason I wanted to right this review. The long distance aspect I relate to so much, spending the days talking to your partner, connecting through mutual interests and certain things we both love so much. The ending where you break-up so because of the distance and both of you needing to have your future was bittersweet to me. It's how me and my ex broke up. The part where you have to click the box multiple times and keeps moving around is so accurate to hard it is to say \"I want to break up\", especially when you both still love eachother and don't want to. It happened to me and those words were the hardest to say in my entire life, we both loved eachother so much. I was devastated for a while afterwards, I felt like an import piece of me was gone, and it would take a very long time to get back. It took a while, but I got over her being completely gone from my life.\n\nThis game makes me want to reach out to her, but there needs to be more time for us to grow individualy. We're not ready to talk to eachother yet, I will wait until we are ready. There are still things I want to apologize for saying right after we broke-up, as I was heartbroken and didn't reflect my actual feelings.

I figured I'd leave a review that might help those people feel a bit less crazy, as well as explain what the rest of the game did to reel me in after the first story left me feeling unsatisfied.\n\nMy problems with the first story come down to both a lack of proper conveyance as to what you're actually able to do, as well as the solutions to the problems presented becoming predictable after this was realized. I went through it twice, trying different things both times, only to end up with the bad ending again with no signs that I did any better. It wasn't until I looked up a guide that I learned that you can interact with the environment. More frustratingly, one puzzle required me to scroll down on the mouse wheel in order to see certain important elements. The fact that this is even possible is not conveyed at all, and it never comes up again. Once I figured out I could do these things, finishing the first story with a good ending was just as simple as finding the spots I was supposed to click on the screen, which left me feeling like I got the best ending, not because I did a good job, but because the game screwed me about until I looked up a guide. That being said, it wasn't without it's good points. There were two puzzles in there that did feel thematically appropriate enough to serve the story's message. One of them I probably could've figured out on my own if I hadn't already gotten frustrated enough to look up a guide. Having completed the game, I get the message this story was trying to get across, but the way it was executed resulted in it falling kind of flat.\n\nThe second story comes along and either helps fix my problems with the previous story, or turns those problems into positives. This one starts by forcing you to interact with something in the environment in order to proceed, which would've helped convey that you can do that if it was present in the first story. That segment is followed up with a puzzle that was able to help me understand what was going through the head of the main character through game mechanics alone, and this isn't the only puzzle in this story to do that. Without wishing to spoil, the predictability that dragged down much of the first story ends up working to the benefit of the second story, through the ways they subverted my expectations. In the first story, it felt like my expectations were being subverted about what I could do, rather than what I should do. I never felt that way in story two.\n\nThe third story switches up the format by becoming a point-and-click, the puzzle design of which is pleasant enough, but what sucked me in about that particular chapter was how the game kind of tricks you into getting the bad ending, but unlike story one, shows you what you can do differently to achieve the best outcome. In this instance, it felt like it wanted me to see the difference the two choices made, and it presented the \"here's another things you could've done\" thing in believable way. I saw the consequences of the bad choice first, without feeling frustrated and like I was being railroaded into the conclusion they were going for.\n\nEach of the three stories could be summed up with the phrase \"subversion of expectations\". The first story subverted my expectations in a way that made me feel like the way forward was hidden from me by simply not knowing what I could actually do in the game. However the other two stories subverted my expectations in a way that made me feel like I was naturally ending up in the scenarios the devs wanted me to end up in, rather than getting me stuck in the conclusion they wanted by being overly obscure, as well as getting me to feel and think the things that the main characters of those stories might be feeling and thinking. I wish I could go into greater detail, but I would end up spoiling my favorite parts of the game. If you end up picking this game up, and you end up as put off by the first story as I was, I'd suggest you give it a little more time.

But the eureka moments it can provide to players are valuable as well. And the first part is just like a tutorial of the game. It can provide even more to players' emotional value afterward. However, I still feel sorry about your bad experience, it's my duty to use my design to let you get the eureka moment. I just don't have the ability to achieve that for every player. Some people think it's difficult to find out, some people don't. I can't fulfill two opposite requirements at one time.\n\nSorry, I don't know what to say. (Especially in English)\nHope you will find the answer.\nAnd wish you a good day/night."}, "131200460": {"recommendationid": "131200460", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033654450", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1674202878}, "language": "english", "review": "i'll say one thing thats definite about this game, its cute", "timestamp_created": 1674214419, "timestamp_updated": 1674214419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131196560": {"recommendationid": "131196560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150382954", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 110, "last_played": 1674207120}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this.

three couples. The first two are more linear in the storytelling, while the third functions more as a point-and-click detective mode. None of the stories are long in of themselves - the shortest being the third - and probably won't take any longer than an hour and a half, give or take. How you are affected by the actual content of the stories will boil down subjectively from person to person, although I can certainly see how people could be moved by the stories, or at least the themes they personify. \n\nThe first story is the most straight forward of the bunch, but also isn't. Without giving away mechanics or story beats, it encourages failure your first time going, resulting in a breakup in universe. Upon subsequent playthroughs is when you realize what you need to accomplish to succeed. It isn't clear at first how to solve these dilemmas at first, but once you solve one, you can pretty easily solve the others and get that perfect ending. The one exception is a dilemma with a solution requiring mechanics that aren't prompted at any time or even used at any other point in the future in either this story or the other three. Once you get past that though, the result feels heartwarming and worth the effort, great or small. \n\nPassing the first story successfully should make it easier to pass the second one. The mechanics required for success are indicated more clearly here as opposed to the first story's approach. The story won't even continue if you \"fail\" during dilemmas, and will even allow you to jump to specific chapters to pick up at any point. On a personal level, the story itself on this one was more relatable and compelling for me. Perhaps it's mainly because unlike the other two stories, the couple have their own names. I also like the story's approach to the endings, comprising of two (discounting the fail ending). Again without giving anything away, a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario that is heartbreaking in concept. \n\nThe third story is very simple. There isn't a fail state here at all and the pace of it falls onto the player. Just follow the clues and find the answers you seek. Once you get the ending normally, you can go back to the first chapter that instigated the sequence of events. From there, you do what you have to do and achieve the game's main ending and end credits. The song at the end is really nice btw. \n\nAll in all, the game is small, affordable, and pleasant in it's presentation to it's simple storytelling. There's also some good wallpapers you can get by playing the game as well if you like the artstyle. It won't take you long to finish or even to complete either.

I love multiple ending games, but this one just didn't scratch that itch. \n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1674149584, "timestamp_updated": 1674149584, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503992915153503418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1674152114, "developer_response": "Hi,\nThank you for trying our game and sorry for the bad experience.\nThe game is more difficult and more complicated than it looks.\nI hope the message below will help you find a better experience.\n\n1.

Cute artstyle, but not worth your while if you already understand the concept of \"treat them like a person\" \"let them explore who they are and who they want to be\" and also the third lesson is straight-up \"trust that your spouse isn't cheating on you\" which isn't exactly helpful.\n\nBy the way, in that third lesson, the story gives you the option to ask your husband about the suspicious phone call that you saw (which is what makes you think they're cheating in the first place) but even if you choose to confront him, literally nothing about the story changes. I thought the whole point of the first story was to communicate well and try to understand how your partner feels! Not to just brush things off and simply *assume* that everything's fine between you two- especially so, when we later see in multiple examples around the house (such as not cleaning the litterbox and not helping with laundry) that your husband hasn't exactly been a great comfort, and appears to leave many chores for *you* to do instead. What happened to balance?\n\nAlso, while the gameplay *is* charmingly simple, it's actually quite difficult to *see* what you need to do. Light puzzle spoilers dead ahead: needless to say, the way objects are highlighted by the cursor hardly makes them stand out at ALL. I'm almost wondering if the developers decided to do this to extend the playtime. After all is said and done, it feels like half of my time with this game was spent randomly clicking the screen because barely anything in the backgrounds stands out enough to look like it should be clickable. And don't get me STARTED on how they made you use the scroll wheel that one, SINGULAR time. If it were a regular game mechanic, I could forgive it, but wow, you REALLY do just have to *guess* to solve that one.\n\nAnd one more thing- one of the dialogue choices in the first story- that being: \"can i hold your hand\"- is a perfectly fine thing to ask, and I don't know why the game treats it as thought it \"ruins the mood\". Have you considered how important consent is? Even for seemingly simple things like that? You don't know what any given person has gone through in their lives. Physical touch isn't automatically welcome from an acquaintance just because you've had a nice night with them so far.\n\nBut hey, it was two bucks, right?

I didn't realize how cold and unfeeling I was until I played not even 2 minutes of this game, and as my digital girlfriend left me for being cold and calculative, I wondered what I did wrong. I was dumbfounded, I thought we were doing well, but apparently not. Needless to say, my first time playing it didn't go over well, and so I decided to give it another go. The second time I played it, I discovered these zodiac ciphers within the game's text, as I shook, dragged, rotated, and spammed my mouse across my screen to find solutions outside the choices presented to me. I eventually found that there lie something beneath the surface of every encounter, sometimes no words were needed for a perfect moment, and other times you realize just bending to another's will isn't right, and there must be an understanding among the two people to maintain a stable relationship. Although I failed spectacularly my first time playing LoveChoice, I realized that only made me appreciate the game on my second run even more. I looked closer at the text and no longer was it just cold text, it had meaning and emotion behind it. My failure helped me learn from my shortcomings, and I worked to better myself and unknowingly bettered myself too, if only by a little. Surprisingly, this candy bar priced game made me take a  look at my self, and gave me more enjoyment in the first 5 minutes than some A list games give in the first 2 hours. I never played a dating game before, but I recommend people who also haven't play this one.

Hope you find games you like. Thanks.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nupdate:\nThank you for the update.\nAs a game, I agree that the mechanics in this game is tricky. However, if we look into real life. I would say a relationship is way more tricky than this. If we are using our game experience and knowledge to understand this game, we easily miss the hints to find out the real answer, but if we are sensitive enough and try treating the character as a real person, that won't be that difficult. \nI would say we always tend to ignore others' efforts and overrate ours. It's the same in the game or in the real life. If we look at it from the outside, a girl who \ncan give me a forgiving hug just after she got cursed by me, who is willing to spend 3 years with me regrating what I did, who can share the same dream and purpose of life with me. I can't say she making no effort. Besides, we can know that they broke up at the BE of the story. But we don't know who brings that up. Still, we are tending to think that was her fault. It's a sad but realistic part of this story.\nThe 1st story act as a tutorial in the game. If you are more interested in complicated story-telling, maybe you should try the other stories. Forget about it if you already did.\nThank you for trying my game and leaving comments.\nBest wishes"}, "114366694": {"recommendationid": "114366694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450258362", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1650348729}, "language": "spanish", "review": "bastante bueno, las historias pueden cambiar dependiendo de muchas cosas,  solo que no me gusto tanto la segunda historia :,(, pero es un buen juego en cuanto a la trama :,)", "timestamp_created": 1650759463, "timestamp_updated": 1650759463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114360676": {"recommendationid": "114360676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805405913", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 221, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1655780074}, "language": "english", "review": ":steamthumbsup:", "timestamp_created": 1650749688, "timestamp_updated": 1650765955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749081611633301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114315798": {"recommendationid": "114315798", "author": {"steamid": "76561199224193875", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1686892519}, "language": "english", "review": "Garbage game, played seven or eight times, still broke up.

They don't tale a lot of your time, but they get their point across and you feel a strong connection to the developer and the message they are trying to get across. LoveChoice is an example of one of these games.\n\nLoveChoice is a small Visual Novel game that breaks you into 3 different stories. The first story is how a man and woman meet at a Game Jam and they develop a relationship. Depending on your actions they will stay together or break up. The second story is about a boy named a Stan and a girl named Grace. They start as childhood friends and eventually become more, but their dreams and aspirations separate them into a long distance relationship. The final story is about a wife who is nervous that her husband is hiding something from her and decides to search the house to see what he is hiding.\n\nOne of my favorite things about LoveChoice is how it knows what players expect from a Visual Novel and turns it on its head. The first story, for example, will always lead to a bad ending if you play the game like a standard visual novel. However, at the end, it gives you hints on what you need to do to get the good ending. A lot of times it's not about making a choice, but looking for the third option *hint hint*. Because of that, it made the stories and the lessons so impactful and I really loved it.\n\nThe music was also very beautiful. Another thing I loved was the mini games and little effects they added as well. There would be scenes where your mouse cursor is pulled or repelled away from a certain thing on the screen and I really loved that effect as it really hit home how tough it was to make said choice or decision.\nI have no gripes with this game honestly. It is short and to the point, and once I figured out what it was trying to teach me, it made me appreciate it greatly!\n\nFinal verdict? This is a wonderful game and will only take 1-2 hours of your time at most. The lessons and stories were really beautiful and I cherish the them greatly. Definitely check this one out if you're looking for a unique Visual Novel game with a nice premise.

Each game within the main game is not that long, but put them altogether and to get all the endings and achievements it took me about 2 hours.  Each story tackles relationships from a different angle.  And each one tries to teach something about relationships and love.  The message itself is beautiful.  If you start from the first game, and then play the second one, and then the third you will find it surely but steadily snowballing emotionally.  Each story is unique, and beautifully told.  And I think it could also be educational for people who have not had many relationships.  But the core message itself is LOVE.\n\nAnd honestly for the price I paid for it, it was definitely worth experiencing.  I personally could relate to each one of them.  And I found the stories to be beautifully told.  \n\nSo to sum it up:\n\n-  This is a collection of 3 games.\n-  They're all about LOVE\n-  Each story is unique in it's own way, and well written.  They will most likely have an emotional impact on you.\n-  The games employ interesting point and click mechanics\n\nAnd last but not least, MAKE SURE you watch the END CREDITS in FULL or you will miss out. :)  \n", "timestamp_created": 1640909237, "timestamp_updated": 1640909237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594059407711029053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106882331": {"recommendationid": "106882331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838294361", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 101, "last_played": 1640842877}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the very few games that made me tear up a little bit. wonderful stories and i really enjoyed the short experience i had.", "timestamp_created": 1640842979, "timestamp_updated": 1640842979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106800707": {"recommendationid": "106800707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206746868", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126, "last_played": 1640755426}, "language": "english", "review": "[strike] LoveChoice [/strike]\n[b] ExistentialCrisis [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1640755603, "timestamp_updated": 1640755603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106781880": {"recommendationid": "106781880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260101702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1641142968}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc9aLoveChoice\ud83d\udc9c\n\ud83c\udf19 Short game\n\ud83d\udd25 Awesome artstyle\n\ud83c\udf38 Good insights into love and communication \n\ud83c\udf39 Relaxing, with ambient music\n\ud83d\ude18 The achievements are easy to get a 100% achievement rate on\n\ud83d\udc99 Casual \n\ud83c\udf19 The devs are wholesome and humble creators.

It's might not make your experience better, but maybe it will help you understand why the game designed like it is now.\nIn the first story, players experience a 3-year long relationship with around 10 mins. I don't believe there is zero communication in a 3-years relationship. And considering no matter what the boy actually did, the girl will live with him for at least 3 years long. I personally don't think she is picky. Besides, we actually don't know why they two broke up from the story, or who started the \"broke up\" conversation. What we know is that after their break up, the girl sends a letter to the boy and tell him about her feeling when they are still together. Is that really a terrible thing? Sadly, when the love is gone, we tend to consider it's our partner's fault, just like we did in a real relationship.\nTelling players you can click things is way easier than designing all the \"soft indications\" in the game. I can do that, but it won't provide players the real eureka moments. I can't provide the eureka moments and make sure everyone can figure out the trick in the meantime. Still, sorry about your experience. Besides, there is actually many hints in the game, way more than we have in a real relationship I think, after all it's a game. Sadly, we tend to ignore them no matter there is a game or a real relationship.\nI'm not good at English, I hope I make myself clear enough. \nSorry again about you experience.\nBesides, you can still try the rest of the game if you want.

I am pleasantly surprised by the number of possibilities in each story, which generates some difficulty to finish the game completely!

I remember reading a review here that went something along the lines of \"realise where you're going wrong and you'll understand why you were single for so long.\"\n\nSounded like a challenge \u2013 so I took it as one. I played the game twice, and \"lost\" both times. Then I read more reviews, of which one pointed out there's an \"interactive\" aspect to it that I may have overlooked.\n\nI played the game the third time, and voila, that \"helpful\" review I read was indeed right. If I had done something like this, I would've \"won\" the game.\n\nNow, here's the problem: How was I supposed to know that's how the interaction works? There's zero indication or hint to show it'd work that way. Hence, it's a design problem, not a player problem. The \"think outside the box\" strategy seems to overstretch quite a bit with visual novels and at this rate, it's frankly super tiring.\n\nThe game indeed does carry a heartwarming message.

This game is so warm and fuzzy, and love that stuff.\n\nThis game was too adorable to rate it a thumbs down. And, mind you, I was being ridiculous because my amazing friend bought this game for me! So I have no idea what I was on. My mind randomly goes on crack sometimes.\n\nThe last story was my favourite in my opinion. The story was very well thought out.\nThe stories as also very realistic. The relationships are realistic, and the stories give great life advice! (Such as; Love works both ways. Relationships work only both make an effort to stay in contact, so on a so forth). But the romantic feeling never goes away! Literally real life true love stuff right here folks.\n\nSince this game gave a feel of realism as well as a fuzzy romantic feeling, I believe this game will be very helpful to preteens.

It contains three distinct love stories, each examining a different type of relationship. It takes somewhere in the range of two hours to complete if one is playing it straight through to the end. A couple of out-of-the way achievements add a bit of mileage to the gameplay.\n\nThe art and music are both terrific and two of the most memorable aspects of LoveChoice. The story-book look works very well, although I did occasionally have some minor difficulty figuring out all the things I could interact with in a scene. The three stories are well told, and the best choices make sense in the context of what is happening.\n\nThe biggest weakness in the English version of the game is that the dialogue often sounds unnatural and wooden. There is never a point where the story or characters do not make sense, but what they say often sounds awkward. To be fair, however, the developers are forthright about the translation process, and the issues are ultimately outweighed by LoveChoice's very reasonable price and all of its merits. With that being said, I hope that it eventually receives a more professional English translation.\n\nIt has my recommendation - even at full price LoveChoice is a good way to spend an evening or a weekend.", "timestamp_created": 1615687456, "timestamp_updated": 1615687456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88182112": {"recommendationid": "88182112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374288932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1615373512}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was short, sweet and to the point.

En ocasiones jugar\u00e1s unos peque\u00f1os minijuegos, pero no son muchos, lo mas importante es las historias rom\u00e1nticas.\n[*]Es una lastima que el juego no te indique las reglas (usar o no el mouse), pero puedes interactuar con el fondo, esto es importante para sacar los finales buenos. \n[*]Hablemos un poco de la historia, las tres son muy buenas e interesantes, pero no hay ramificaciones para tener mejores finales, solo hay 3 por cada una, algunas son muy restrictivas y te obligan a hacer m\u00e1s acciones para obtenerlas.\n[*]El \u201cromance\u201d en el juego toca en diferentes puntos: a veces solo lo superficial y lo que es com\u00fan en este sentimiento, otras tocan m\u00e1s la sensibilidad del jugador y se avienta buenos giros de trama.

Solo son 3 historias, quiz\u00e1 hubiera sido interesante ver algunas m\u00e1s o alg\u00fan DLC. Tambi\u00e9n puede ser jugar los minijuegos por separado, algunos est\u00e1n buenos.\n-Estructura: como ya mencion\u00e9, el juego toca de forma superficial el romance, pero a veces si se dan sus vueltas para explicar otro punto de vista al romance, no es constante y var\u00eda mucho.

It's only my humble opinion.\n\nIn the beginning, I was so angry about this game: \"The girl does not say anything, so I have not much to work with.\" or \"I would do this stuff very different, why do you only give me this options?!\" \nI really was about to refund the game.. until I understood how to play it properly. Suddenly discovering how to to go with the options I wanted the whole time.. This made up for a completely different experience.\n\nThe best advice this game is giving is: [b]\"Relationships should rely on mutual understanding, not changing who you are.\"[/b]\nThat means understanding, accepting, listening, working together and growing as a person and team. \n\n[hr][/hr] \nBut a bit of advice: Do never make yourself rely on anyone too much, is it a friend or a partner, as they can break your trust and when they leave, it is possible you break down. \n\nThis game does not teach anyone to find someone you cannot live without, but how to live together and enrich their lives, because they want and not need to! Sometimes this also means letting go, because working together just does not work anymore.\n\nStill, I need to criticize it.. sometimes people can be nervous on their first date and say something, which might kill the mood, but in this case no one has the right to get upset about it. \nWork with it, that is how this person works and do not expect anything. Some people might not behave like you want them to be, but that is the point - No one will be perfect.\nIf you are unable to work with their personality, then this might be an indicator that he/she is not the \"right one\" for you. Leave. \n\nNo one should play around/act, of course some people want to impress us, but if we fall in love with someone that only exists in our imagination, we are more than disappointed, once the feelings of first love disappear.\n\nAlso, stalking someone on Social Media to get to know them, is a no go. I would not advise it, but that is only my opinion, as it can be helpful to find stuff to talk about. \nBut remember: keeping a conversation alive is part of both sides. Ask them about their interests, keep the conversation going. Do not only talk about or do what he/ she wants. \n\nTELL/ASK people what you want, make a compromise, don't wait for people to guess what you want. Plan together or maybe prepare multiple activities. Do what you BOTH would like to do/see. \n\nPlease, talk to people if you feel unhappy, instead of keeping it in your soul and leave. Like this, no relationship can be saved. [b]Conversation is key.[/b] Ideally face to face. \n\nLove and a relationship is work, same goes for friendships. [b]Do not take this game, nor what anyone says as a manual, find your own pace and work together, only then it can be good.[/b] Of course there are some certain no gos, but this boundaries, we all need to set for ourselves. \n\n..

You don't know her, you just like her because of her looks. DON'T. DO. THAT. LET HER BE. If she needs help it's fine approaching her to offer your help, but anything else is just a NO-NO.\nThen, right after the event, the player contacts her over weChat without having asked her in advance if that was okay.

At first, I was a bit skeptical of LoveChoice with it's short run time and \"Overwhemingly Positive\" review status. I still bought it because as they say, you can refund it if you are not satisfied.\n\nI did not refund it. I was beyond satisfied.\n\nThe art and soundtrack of the game is what holds this game together. The cute and simple art style manages to reinforce that feeling of wholesomeness that is present throughout all the stories. I personally think that this art style was the best way of portraying the story as I was more invested by the cutesy vibe of it all. The soundtrack accompanies the entire game with nice mellow piano and memorable melodies for certain moments.\n\nThe gameplay....well it is a visual novel, so this isn't something that I should heavily criticize on. My only criticism here is that I personally think the mini-games are unnecessary. It feels like they are there to pad the time and are there for the sake of this. I'm talking about the first story with its mini-game as I was really annoyed by it every time after the first.\n\nI'm not sure if this counts as gameplay but this is where the game truly shows its excellence. This was when I decided to make a review. The game is very clever and deceiving with its choices. You are forced to think outside the box to get the endings you want. The moment you realizes that there is more to this game than meets the eye, you will captured by it and will never let go. The way they implement this simple trick matches so well with the theme of love. When it comes to love, sometimes we think we only have a certain number of paths we can go to but in reality, sometimes we should make our own path despite what path is being shown. It is amazing for this reason alone.\n\nPlease play this game.

So I am not sure when you said you are finishing the story 1. It means you have all the 3 endings or you just go through the story once. As the game implied, the story only makes sense after you got at least 2 endings of it. (that is why you need to clear 2 endings before starting the next story.)\n\nAnd the choices and the scripts are not all we have in this game(in case, you didn't know)\n\nIf you already try out the first story and feel it was ridiculous, I do hope to know why it is ridiculous to you.\n\nBecause I wrote this for serious, I don't think it's ridiculous. It's not because of the review numbers. It's because of what I believe. \nTo make the story works for you as well, at least I need to know what you think about it.

The music is good, the art design is really simple but cute. Each story, and each ending is well done and worth reading. I don't want to talk too much about it as it's better left experienced.\n\nThere are some translations/grammatical errors for English in a few places, but it's easily overlooked as you get the gist of it anyway. There are three different stories, each with their own gameplay gimmicks. The first has this minigame which can be tedious if you're going for everything as if you don't get 11/11 of the things you have to re-try. The problem with that is you have to wait for the entire minigame to end before being able to retry it which gets tedious. Most of my time was waiting for that minigame to end so I could retry [I wasn't sure if it actually carried over a 11/11 or not, since when I chose to skip it the second playthrough the ending said I didn't do any planning. Despite having gotten 11/11 my first playthrough...]  \n\nOtherwise it's fun, it's just clicking on a thing that shows up an not hitting the bad ones. Eventually it hides one under a hat and shuffles it around to find, those are always fun to me. And the last one has you needing to follow two hats with pop ups to distract you. The third has a short  match three minigame in it which is cute.\n\nThe only other criticism I have of the game is it doesn't convey what you are allowed to do as a player so without a guide or just trying everything out of the sake of it, you might miss how to do some things. I tried to wait at one point, but nothing seemed to happen so I just assumed I couldn't wait. But you can.

The stories vary in their length with a reading time of 10 to 30 minutes for each story. This surely isn't much length-wise but it's surely enough to leave an striking impression behind.\n\nWhen I played the first story for the first time I just thought it's just a run-of-the-mill Visual Novel with dialog-based choices that determine which ending you will get. After a few minutes I reached my first ending and thought \"Well, it's probably a normal ending\" and I was quite shocked when I read the letter with all sentences being red and getting the message that the couple split up.\nIn the second run I decided to take the other options and still got a bad ending. Just why?!? There aren't any other options, or are they? In my third run I noticed that there's more than just the dialog choices as there's other ways to interact with the couple and the environment in nearly all scenes which can change the outcome. And this is probably the part where this collection of stories really begins to shine.\nInstead of presenting you just one dialog box after another with a few choices in between, you also get some basic gameplay of point-and-click-adventures. After getting the hang of it most of those interactions are easy to assume, but there are still some which aren't that intuitive. One example is a scene where you have to scroll the mouse wheel to see more dialog-options. There wasn't any kind of visual hint for this possibility and I guess most will either stumble over this by accident or by looking up a guide (for me it was the latter option). Nonetheless this is only a small flaw and you will get the hang of the possible interactions in a follow-up run.\n\nAbout the stories themselves:\nI don't want to spoil much about them as it's best to experience them with as few knowledge as possible. All I will say is that it's a nice change of pace from all \"standard VNs\" as the couples are presented in a grounded way and you will most likely feel familiar with some of their traits. Personally I felt reminded of myself more than one time. And they surely show you that it's not only the words that matter but also the actions, but even if you give your best you might not get the best outcome and have to accept fate.\n\nPresentation-wise LoveChoice is quite minimalistic but still nice to look at with a mix of crayola- and pastel-like CG-scenes. Personally I enjoyed the main theme but otherwise I have to say that I barely noticed the music, but I have to say that is barely a thing I notice while reading a VN.\n\nOverall I would recommend this to anyone that's slightly interested in stories about love and relationships and wants something with a grounded story.

Here, after only eighty minutes of playtime (as of this review), is an experience that truly surprised me.\n\nLoveChoice is an anthology of short stories revolving around what it means to love. At the time of this review, there are only three stories available, with the promise of more to come. I will review them individually, recounting my experiences with each of them.\n\nGAME:\nThis is the most straightforward of the three stories, presenting itself as a typical visual novel with some cutesy art up front. I followed my gut instinct during my first reading; like many people who reviewed this game, I ended up with a bad ending. I couldn't unlock the second story without getting one more ending, so I tried choices I hadn't done. For some reason, it didn't work. It might've been by accident or something, but I realized that the game was telling me something. I was going through the motions, blindly picking choices as if I were brute-forcing myself to a good ending. It works for most VNs, but not this one. I won't spoil what it is you have to do to get the good ending, but I was frankly surprised at how I had to think outside the box.\n\nDISTANCE:\nI can see why they had to lock DISTANCE behind GAME, because DISTANCE expects you to have gotten the good ending in GAME. It will test your knowledge of the new mechanics and bend your mind and heart trying to get this couple together. You don't really have to do anything special beyond that, but you'll feel as involved in the relationship of these new characters as the ones in GAME. Things get a bit deep here; the characters feel quite human in the decisions they make.\n\nDETECTIVE:\nI wasn't sure what this story would do to shake up the gameplay, or even what story angle it would explore. These stories are all quite simple when you look at them, but there's beauty in their simplicity. This story follows a married woman who suspects her husband is cheating on her with another woman. The game pretty much turns into a point-and-click adventure as you scour the house for clues pointing toward the husband's infidelity. The outcome (again, without spoiling) was quite unexpected, and it fit quite well with the general tone of these stories.\n\nFrom these three stories alone, I have high hopes for the remainder that are being written. On top of that, the presentation of each story is fantastic, from the art to the music to (in some respects) the dialogue. I admit that the translation does have its problems (I ended up catching a line that went completely untranslated in GAME), but I understood enough to follow along with the story. Also, minor complaint, but I wish this game had a 'skip read text' button. :P\n\nBottom line: it's cute, and a breath of fresh air. I'd even go so far as to say that this is what Doki Doki Literature Club should have been.

This is a heartwarming visual novel made by Akaba Studio. One of my followers recommended me to play this game. It is definitely a good game for those who are emotional and mild. The narrative flow is somewhat artificial, but it is a good representation of what the developer wants to say in the game. LoveChoice \u62e3\u7231 is currently in early access and there are 3 stories to access.\n\n[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game genre of LoveChoice \u62e3\u7231 is visual novel and its game engine is unity player. Indie developers use Ren'Py the most in their genres, but more recently they are using the unity engine. Perhaps for a variety of reasons, the Unity engine certainly has some advantages in the VN genre. This game is one such example. This game has some interesting functions that can be interacted with in addition to text.\n\nFor example, like a point-and-click game, it contains hidden messages in the background or props. It is somewhat fresh and makes the storytelling game even more interesting. As well as mini games are included, it affects the story route. The game is generally mild and relaxed, but often displays interactive, dynamic screens such as social media. Such game design was impressive.\n\nRegarding the story, it has meaningful messages about the relationship. There is no right answer for love and relationships. This is just his/her view of the love from this developer has given to the player. Honestly, the story is rather short and the story flow is sudden. But that's enough to convey the theme of the game to the player. The story is sweet, the characters are cute and emotional. We experience it through the game. And it will definitely be a valuable experience.\n\n[h1][b][3] Pros (+) & Cons (-) [/b][/h1]\n[table]\n[td][list]\n[*][+] Heartwarming\n[*][+] Cute Artworks\n[*][+] Good Soundtracks\n[*][+] Interesting VN Design\n[/list][/td]\n[td][list]\n[*][-] Intentional Story Flow\n[*][-] No Skip & Auto Function\n[*][-] Repetitive & Rather Short\n[*][-] Requires Walkthrough Guide\n[/list][/td]\n[/table]\n\n[h1][b][4] Verdict : Game 8/10, Translation 8/10[/b][/h1]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1863687442\n\n[h1][b]Side Note[/b][/h1]\n[code][b]Follow Nyanco Channel \u30fd(=^\uff65\u03c9\uff65^=)\u4e3f[/b] : https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33855818 Maybe some contents you like are only open to our followers exclusively ;)[/code]", "timestamp_created": 1568530046, "timestamp_updated": 1568531062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560623764991760254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55099033": {"recommendationid": "55099033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150560857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1568426454}, "language": "english", "review": "Fluffy, cute, feels good game.", "timestamp_created": 1568426434, "timestamp_updated": 1568426434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494186043739318848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54711373": {"recommendationid": "54711373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839462878", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1596360073}, "language": "spanish", "review": "un juego corto de una duracion de 20 minutos max.Pero si prestas atencion a las historias y les tiempo a los dialogos como hice yo capaz tardes 1hr,las historias pueden  ser un poco cliches pero son entretenidas y con buenos personajes,la musica que envuelve todo en un buen ambiente(se entiende mejor porque la eleccion de la musica con la historia 2)buenos dibujos lo unico malo es el tiempo de juego pero aparte de eso RECOMIENDO ENCARECIDAMENTE JUGARLO 9/10(tiene un 9 por el tiempo si no fuera asi seria 100/10)\n\nNOTA:JUGAR CON UNOS PA\u00d1UELOS\n", "timestamp_created": 1566286160, "timestamp_updated": 1566286160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54659371": {"recommendationid": "54659371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088952011", "num_games_owned": 1803, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1570990354}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es corto pero bello.

It's, of course, a gamer girlfriend \u2014 the one thing that male gamers desperately want but can't seem to get. All jokes asides, LoveChoice \u62e3\u7231 is a short but sweet title starring a boy and a girl both who have a deep passion for making video games, as well as for each other. In this interactive story-telling game, you'll be playing as the boy in his determined endeavor to make the right love choices in his life. LoveChoice \u2014 the most unusual way to hunt for restaurants and darn onion cutting ninjas.\n\nThe story starts off at a game jam where the player, along with the rest of the other indie developers, is attentively working on game concept ideas. During the jam, he happens upon a girl nearby his group's table. He approaches her and they begin a casual chat, and thus, they set off on their new relationship. \n\nAlong the way, you'll be met with a few challenges such as figuring out what movie she wants to watch or playing a curious minigame to find some decent places to eat. These tasks, as Ye from Akaba Studio put it, are supposed to show how,\n\n    \" you should put more effort in and do more preparation for your dating.\"\n\nIt's a great message to those who are in a relationship to always understand that  \"loving your partner\" isn't always a cakewalk. It's quite important to put some day to day effort in making your lover feel genuinely special to you.\n\nLoveChoice's art style has a definite charm to it with an innocent and almost childlike presentation. Both the girl and boy have a distinct, warm delight to their character complexion to complement their adorable appearance. It's quite a contrast from most visual novels in today's market where the characters have jumbo eyes and generous body proportions and features. The minimalistic style of LoveChoice gives me a desire to see more of this kind of artwork in storytelling. Additionally, the music is superbly outstanding \u2014 using soft and gentle soundtracks to effectively support each of the story's scenes. \n\n[b]Spoiler Alert![/b]\nThis next part contains light spoilers, so I encourage those who've yet to play the game to skip on past. \n\nAfter playing the game through a couple times I always ended up confused and bewildered as to why I didn't get an ending that satisfied me. Each playthrough had left me more puzzled than the last. Which choice was I getting wrong? Did I miss some sort of secret choice within the dialogue options? That's when it hit me like a sledgehammer on a bag of Jet-puffed marshmallows. What if the girl didn't want me to choose the dialogue options? What if there was a deeper, more hidden love choice? This is where things took a rather emotional turn for me. It's difficult to explain what a surprising eye-opener it was to finally realize what LoveChoice was truly trying to tell me. All along, the girl wanted me not to just \"say,\" but to \"care and do.\" She wanted me to consider her true heart's desire, even though she didn't explicitly mention it to me. From then onward, I began to diligently search of ways that I could make true love choices for the girl I cared for \u2014 and it was absolutely beautiful. Finally reaching the ending I so desired was certainly a joyful experience. According to LoveChoice's main designer Ye,\n\n    \"I think the \"hidden choice\" like some answers just don't come up in your mind default in real life. They are usually of our comfort zone and need our thinking. Human tends to forget this kind of options,  especially when it was to ones close to us. I am not saying the default  options are bad or wrong, I just want to say the one we truly love  always deserve a better answer.\"\n\nLoveChoice obviously isn't an AAA budget title, nor is a fully fledged indie game. But I can say without a doubt, it gave me a more heartfelt experience than any game I've played in a long time. It compelled me to deeply think and consider my own current relationship along with the \"love choices\" I should look to make. Although I may not be able to guarantee the next person who plays LoveChoice, a touching and moving experience \u2014 it is definitely a precious story that deserves to be heard by all. Sometimes, we need don't a whole 20+ hours of playtime to get a decent gaming experience. Sometimes, all it takes is a short message and a developer's effort to create a game from the heart. Thank you, Akaba Studio, for making such the game I didn't know I needed in my life. I hope that the next stories released in LoveChoice will be just as a heartwarming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1548763912, "timestamp_updated": 1572850403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48553389310836792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48084627": {"recommendationid": "48084627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111630873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1544155891}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game... <3 the art is so cute... and honestly it suprised the heck out of me.", "timestamp_created": 1546564738, "timestamp_updated": 1546564738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48072672": {"recommendationid": "48072672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053422627", "num_games_owned": 2363, "num_reviews": 1186, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1546525410}, "language": "english", "review": "Ehh, it's a sorta cute game...

However, once you figure everything out, you will get a beautiful happy ending.\nI highly recommend this game, especially if you enjoy a short game with a touching story to it.\n\nPros:\n- Adorable artstyle\n- Beautiful story (that is potentially relatable)\n- Nice music\n- Cute achievements that are easy to get\n- Unique visual novel over all\n\nCons:\n- The English isn't amazing at some points. (But it is still good!)\n- The mini-game is a little frustrating.\n- My game glitched a little at one point.

My only very minor spot of grief was a part that [spoiler] involves a mouse movement to advance the characters level of intimacy, that didn't feel intuitive or in line with the idea of the player paying attention (the wheel scroll).  [/spoiler] But again that was really really minor. \n\nOne could argue that the relationship themes presented are simplistic, but I would also recognize that simple things do still matter.  I felt the themes could be applied to both romantic and platonic relationships.  We all want a friend or partner who pays attention to our interests, listens, someone we can connect with.  At times people trivialize these themes in all sorts of relationships, even through adulthood (I myself can be guilty of this!).

But it's not only about the dialogs, I was amazed that sometimes you'll need to look for clues or \"active points\" right inside of... action area, where our heroes are in the game's window. [b]Please, do not use guides or walkthroughs, just try and find solutions by yourself. It's not too hard, and satisfaction is guaranteed.[/b] \n\nDepending on your choices, this story might have a bad ending, a good ending, or a perfect ending. Nice thing is that you'll be told where you did a bad choice, and if you know approximately where was that time in the game, you can start the story again and try harder to find a better solution.\n\nThe game is quite short, a full playthrough will take you approximately 20-25 minutes. I completed the story multiple times and get all the achievements that are currently available in 118 minutes [spoiler], so, technically, I'm still eligible to refund the game, but there's no way I'll do that.[/spoiler].

Even ignoring the awkward translation.\n\n\nLess then five minutes in, the main characters are already dating. So their relationship has all the depth of a puddle. And then within twenty minutes of that, you are already at the final confrontation of whether they stay together or not. Everything in between is just stock relationship subjects like talking and arguing; which are glanced over without the player learning anything about either character. The player makes vague dialogue choices which determine what happens to the relationship, but the dialogue choices have no clear behavioural alignment so the result you get is pretty much random. Especially when the first choice has you outright ask the girl you have never met to be your friend, or outright ask if she wants to hear you rant about your teams game concept; in the middle of a competition about said game concept when the girl is your opponent. Neither of which is socially appropriate, but apparently the game still labels one as positive and one as negative.\n\nIt really does not feel like whoever wrote this had any idea as to what they were doing. There is no pacing or depth to this \"relationship\" simulation at all. The player learns almost nothing about either character through the entire course of the plot, the characters are just relationship dolls. They do not even have names. \n\nIt displays highly surface level understanding of what a relationship is like, and lists exclusively stock \"relationship\" struggles and interactions as the entirety of the plot.\n\n\nThis does however serve as a marvelous example of how superficial average human relationships are. Built on visual and chemical attraction completely void of any level of personal understanding or friendship. Glass partnerships entirely dependent on the two parties serving their designated gender roles and adhering to societal normalcy. The connection held together by the baseless yet intense feeling of \"love\" which keeps both sides fiercely attached to each other without any level of personal intimacy. If at any moment either side stops playing by the chemical encoded rules, the relationship immediately shatters and then they move on to remate with a new partner a few months or a year later and try it all over again. A system entirely designed to serve one ethical purpose, reproduction, and nothing else. So, this plot.\n\nYes it did make me sad, but mostly because it reminded me of how shallow humanity is. This is the opposite of what I am looking to experience in fiction, I'm trying to escape from reality not be reminded of it.\n\n\n\nThe developer thinks I feel bad because I got the bad ending, when all the problems I cite with this plot are about the plot itself and not the ending. Way to try to dismiss my entire point by point dynamic criticism, with a single delusive excuse. Just like how the developer thinks that \"paying more attention\" will get you the better ending, in a game where all the ways you influence the ending are unmarked neutral dialogue options which have zero positive or negative qualities to them so it is physically impossible to tell what the game is interpreting as good or bad because the dialogue options are either both bad or both neutral.\n\nAt least they did not throw a tantrum, like I have seen other developers pull, but they are still just as in denial as literally every developer that bothers to respond to my negative reviews.", "timestamp_created": 1538554052, "timestamp_updated": 1538645391, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626029849052429199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1539420618, "developer_response": "Hello, actually this game has 3 endings.\n\nI am not sure, but I think you feel bad because you just go through the bad ending.\nAnd I am pretty sure what you are looking for is hidden in the other 2 endings.\n\nI know reality does not work like this.\nBut in this game, the player who paid more attention will get the better ending.\n\nI am sorry that my game design didn't make you feel in that way.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nYe@AkabaStudio\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nSorry for picking this up late^_^\n\nAs you mentioned.\n\"in a game where all the ways you influence the ending are unmarked neutral dialogue options which have zero positive or negative qualities to them so it is physically impossible to tell what the game is interpreting as good or bad because the dialogue options are either both bad or both neutral.\"\n\nYou feel in this way because I designed the game in this way.

The story about love and relationship. We have two characters, a young man who is a game designer, and a young woman who is a designer too. They met in an event and it is your task to approach the girl right. Each choice will affect the relationship, the way you speak with her, interact and even the movie you pick to watch in your first date. Not to forget that you'll have to find a 5 stars restaurant to eat in with a cute mini-game. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1527739231\n\nWhen you finish a play through the girlfriend either break up with you or stay, depends on how you've been treating her. The last message she gives you is a hint of how things should have gone, you can reply the game over and over to get the perfect relationship which I eventually did as I realized this game is not just a visual novel with choices, but an 'interactive' game. You interact with everything around your 'or not' to get things right, for example when you argue with her, it is better not to say anything. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1527756752\n\nI liked the cute artwork, the characters design and the color choice of the game is really nice. The music is fitting and gives a nice atmosphere for the game. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1527739590\n\nPros:\n+Cute artwork. (You can get all the backgrounds from the extra section)\n+Cute story about relationships.\n+Choices and consequences.\n+Nice soundtracks. \n+Steam achievements.\n\nCons:\n-Quite short, depends on how fast you are to get the perfect relationship.\n-No Manuel save.\n\nI do recommend this cute short game, it is very refreshing and has 3 endings.
