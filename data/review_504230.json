Celeste is my first and proper exposure to a platformer, and I couldn't have picked a better game to be my teacher. Playing through Celeste felt like an intense emotional journey, and by the time the credits start rolling, I feel like I've never been more intertwined, both personally and emotionally, with a character's purpose and motivation than I was with Madeline's journey to conqueror Mount Celeste. To understand what makes Celeste feel so unique and fresh to play, I need to go over what I believe to be its best strengths while addressing some of its more questionable and eye-raising design and creative decisions. \n\n[h2] What I Loved About Celeste \u25bc [/h2]\n\n[b] 1. The Story [/b]\nAn odd thing to praise considering most platformers are not known for their stories, but Celeste is unlike most. A few people have said that Celeste is a fantastic example of a video game serving as a catalyst for positive change, and as ridiculous as that sounds at first, I think they might be right. Regardless of where one is in life, Celeste deals with themes and topics we can all relate to and understand: Self-loathing, self-forgiveness, the courage to face your problems, and finding inner strength to grow. And Maddy, the writer of Celeste, executed her themes perfectly without it ever sounding cliche, sappy, or preachy. As a result, the journey of Madeline becomes the journey of the player, and at the risk of sounding overly sentimental, I feel like I grew too. Becoming kinder, not only to myself but also to other people. It's a story I'm sure many players could identify with, and I hope they come to appreciate it as much as I do. \n\n[b] 2. The Sadistic Gameplay [/b]\nIt's not an exaggeration when I say that Celeste is perhaps the most difficult game I have ever played. But damn, is it f#cking good! The gameplay is tighter than a [spoiler] my lawyer has advised me not to finish this joke [/spoiler]. The level designs are as creative as it is challenging, always pushing players past their comfort zones and never being afraid to demand technical proficiency from their audience. Every chapter introduces something new to spice up the gameplay, and it's rewarding to beat like any skill-based game should. It's addicting, and I couldn't get enough of it. It's Precision Puzzle Platformer done right.\n\n[b] 3. The Phenomenal Soundtrack [/b]\nComposed by Lena Raine, the OST is nothing short of a certified banger. Every track captures the mood and feeling of the game perfectly and is the secret sauce behind the success of Celeste. It's the cherry on top of atomic proportion and serves as the player's comforting orchestra of failure as you accidentally dash yourself into yet another wall of spikes for the hundredth times, and wonder why god hates you. But hey, at least the beautiful music soothes the pain. Jokes aside, definitely a strong contender for one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. \n\n[b] 4. The Art [/b]\nWhat else can I say that you can't already see for yourself? The game's freaking gorgeous. It's colorful, cute, and oozes personality thanks to its strong visual style and presentation. The artists did a terrific job with Celeste. Enough said. \n\n[b] 5. The Strawberries [/b]\nCeleste is one of the few games that manages to implement hard mode in one of the cleverest ways I've ever seen. Whereas most games asked you to choose a difficulty option before starting, Celeste took another route and embedded its hard mode directly into the gameplay using strawberry collectibles. They act almost like bait, luring and enticing players to come and get them, but with a catch: They are always situated in the most dicey and difficult-to-reach spot on the stage. And since these strawberries are entirely optional to collect, they act as a brilliant way to subtly and subconsciously encourage players to be adventurous with their risk-taking without ever forcing anything on them.  \n\n[h2] What I Not So Loved About Celeste \u25bc [/h2]\n\n[b] 1. The Epilogues [/b]\nChapters eight and nine serve as the epilogues, and in my opinion, they are entirely unnecessary and pointless additions to what was otherwise an already perfect ending. Chapter seven acts as a meaningful ending and emotional climax for Madeline's character arc and finishes her story on a high with hopeful optimism that leaves players completely satisfied and content. Why bring her back only to introduce so little in the way of narrative significance? The ending left players on an emotional high point and should've stayed that way. Chapters eight and nine needlessly extended the run time for what is little more than side stories.\nThink about the endings to all your favorite games and movies. Now imagine what would happen if they were all extended by another 2 hours. Yeah, exactly. Emotional pacing ruined. \n\n[b] 2. The Insane Difficulty [/b]\nSpecifically, chapters eight and nine including B-sides and C-sides. Before anybody starts losing respect for me due to this criticism, let me explain. I've never been one to complain about a game being too punishing. Truthfully, not even once. So, believe me when I say the difficulties of Celeste's epilogues and side content border on the insane and the unreasonable. To put it into perspective, has anyone seen those crazy viral Super Mario Maker levels where it's so tough that only a handful of people have managed to beat it? Yeah, Celeste is not only kissing that, but also giving it a run for its money. When something is that unbalanced and hellish to complete, is it even fun anymore? What's the point? I'm sorry, but when most of your players have no idea how to even begin to solve your platforming puzzles, let alone the mechanical skills needed to execute them, and have to rely on in-game-provided cheats to have any hope of beating your content, that's going a step too far in my personal opinion. Moreover, because these stages are so challenging and often long, they quickly devolve into a frustrating cycle that forces players to engage in a trial-and-error gameplay loop that does nothing but infuriate them and increases burnout. I love hard games, but this is simply too much. \n\n[h3] My Final Thoughts [/h3]\n\nAside from those two criticisms, all in all, I loved Celeste and thoroughly enjoyed my time with it to summit and back. For an indie studio, Maddy Makes Games had achieved success that most teams can only dream of, and they did it all while laying their hearts on the table and, with grits, delivered us one of the finest and most memorable platformers of all time. Celeste is a genuine masterpiece, and I couldn't end my review without claiming it otherwise.

course, it's not a easy game, but with perseverance you can beat the entire game easily, im not the best platform player, and still got every achievement on less than 50 hours, so yeah, if you learn

The whole game is beautiful from start to finish, it is legitimately a piece of art. The gameplay and story are both amazing with the story being a surprise to me as I was not expecting to enjoy it that much. Each level feels unique and you can feel a sense of progression as you play and get better ultimately paying off in the end with a huge sense of accomplishment! I think anyone who wants to challenge themselves but still enjoy the whole experience should try this game for sure! I give it a [b]9/10[/b]\n\n[h2] HIGHLIGHTS [/h2]\n[list]\n    [*][b]THE ART[/b] - The art in this game is stunning. From the masterful pixel art in the sprites and environments to the adorable hand drawn style of art for the dialogue its just perfect! \n    [*][b]THE STORY[/b] - Going into Celeste I was expecting great game-play and art but what i was not expecting was a beautiful story with a very relatable and deep message behind it.\n    [*][b]THE GAME-PLAY[/b] - Its just perfect! Each new mechanic fits in with the last yet provides something new and it really feels like every section was deliberate and meticulously planned out to be a fun experience to figure out the almost puzzle like aspect to it and then execute the timing and precision, its the perfect level of difficulty with being challenging but not annoyingly difficult.\n    [*][b]THE MUSIC[/b] - It's beautiful, each track fits the atmosphere and vibe of the level and can go from a lovely, slow melody to an intense and inspiring rhythm! It's just the cherry on top for this masterpiece of a game!\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1700169268, "timestamp_updated": 1700169268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Please make your game politically neutral and not written or intended for certain audiences if you want more people to enjoy it.\n\nI know a good platformer when I play it, and that's f*cking Mario Bros, Rare games like Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong, etc.... They've gotten the family-friendly formula down for platformers because they are able to be played by all audiences. This game is a JOKE compared to those platformers.\n\nSeriously, you guys expect NORMAL people to play a platformer this difficult and enjoy it?

A delightful, charming, heartwarming and the most challenging 2D platformer I ever laid my eyes on. With a surprisingly gorgeous pixel art, sublime soundtrack and a simple, yet incredibly heartfelt story about personal growth in many different ways, it's a must recommend to everyone.\n\n\"But what about the high difficulty level?\"\n\nThe game accomodates to several different skill levels and while on a 100% completion save file collecting every collectible (which thankfully, are just for the flex points) you would need to become a hardened platformer veteran, the most important part of the game, which is Madeline's Journey and the main levels are acessible to all, be it by default or through assist mode, allowing to extend your safety net even further if for any reason the challenge prove to be unsurmountable for any particular reason. I do advise on exercising some restraint with Assist mode, as overcoming difficult odds are a part of Celeste's theme, so my honest recommendation is that you use Assist mode in order to set the challenge level to something you can tackle, rather than to completely vanquish it.\n\nIt's a delightful game. I never got 100% completion with the extra hard collectibles, but that's fine. I got as far as I did, maybe I'll go further later, maybe not. Both scenarios are ok. This is my journey, just like Madeline has hers.\n\nI wish anyone who decides to buy this game a happy climbing and I see you on the top!", "timestamp_created": 1699938222, "timestamp_updated": 1699938222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150097468": {"recommendationid": "150097468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036513804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1451, "playtime_at_review": 13860, "last_played": 1700625577}, "language": "english", "review": "I know I'm a few years late to the party, but I was recently recommended this game via a WoW guildie and about 6(?) weeks ago decided to give it a try. I can honestly say this is one of the best platformers I've ever played. The progression of difficulty, even on the A sides, is just something I've rarely seen before. (Maybe I need to play more games..)\n\nI remember so many instances of thinking 3A was impossible, then moving on and thinking 7A was impossible, that I'd never beat 8A, etc. Then thinking I'd never even try the B sides, but going back and collecting all of the strawberries I had missed thinking \"and I thought this was hard\". Then, getting through 2B and thinking \"well maybe just a couple more, but surely not 6-8B\". Then slogging through 7 and 8B just because I wanted to see the C sides, then realizing how short those were decided to grind for those and so many deaths later, I did it! 7C might be the single hardest thing I've done in gaming. So insanely frustrating but immense release at finally getting to that last meadow. \n\nCeleste strikes such a balance of skill for all levels, depending on what your goals are. I've barely experimented with assist mode, but it seems to be such a smart way of helping people progress through tough parts of the game if desired.\n\nAnd last but definitely not least, the music/soundtrack is one of the best I've heard. I would frequently just let Madeline sit at whatever room I was in non-paused and listen to the music while I worked. It's that good. \n\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699935068, "timestamp_updated": 1699935252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150095679": {"recommendationid": "150095679", "author": {"steamid": "76561199572064199", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1444, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1700715687}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

It\u2019s what we grew up on whether it be Sonic, Spyro, Zelda, Crash, Jak & Dax, Rach & Clank or the timeless Don himself Mario. The joy of finally scaling that challenging level & grabbing that dopamine doused hidden shiny gives us that feeling of YIPPEE! It\u2019s that essence which takes us back to the joy of it all, without ever being consciously sentimental, quite the opposite, it\u2019s gaming in the moment & there\u2019s no time to indulge in mawkish overthinking because I have to double dash onto that bouncy-bounce so I can roll under the spiky-spikes to get the golden thingy!!!, if that sentence is gibberish to you then you need to rediscover all that is good & pure in the world.\n\nFirst impressions: It welcomed me in with luminous twilight tones, fantastical purple motif, idiosyncratic pixel pals ...then once it had me seduced it encouraged me through cut-scenes and early challenges to believe that I WILL find a way to push through when needed, so I accepted I may not get things the first time but I do pride myself on resilience & being able to work stuff out, the challenge was afoot. Celeste was not a purchase I jumped into, I didn\u2019t want to be too frustrated by the trial & error drudgery or solely reaction based game-play but it balanced in puzzler aspects really well, I will invest time in a good 'chin-scratcher' (if it's done cleverly) which I did with Celeste.\n\nSo I reached the peak of the mountain in Celeste I took the honour of a heartfelt sigh, switched to speakers to hear the soundtrack one last time then lent back in my chair to watch those rolling credits.

Celeste is an extremely hard platformer, while only having 3 mechanics. climb, dash, and jump. but while only using few mechanics, you still feel like the game is fare. every time you die, you feel like its your fault.\n\nthe amazing acceleration and friction of Madeline, makes it feel like you are in full control. the fact how the dash is rather short but its momentum is what is making you go far. and because of this momentum, you are able to create some awesome moves like:\n1. wave dashing \n2. demo dashing\n3. hyper dash\n(etc)\n\nthe lore and gameplay complement each other so well. from the little struggle of chapter 1, to the acceptance in chapter 6 and 7.\n\nchapters 8 and 9 are much harder than any level that ive played. i thought \"chapter 9 cannot be as hard as chapter 8, there is no way.\". i died 867 times in chapter 8 and it took me 3 hours. Chapter 9 just starts pssing on you out of spite! 11 fucking hours and 5876 deaths! but fuuuck it was so fun\n\nthe b and c sides are not something im gonna get into because, lets just say its all the

I mean, I wasn't initially expecting terribly much when I began playing as this was my first platformer and I got it on sale but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWhether it was the gorgeous visuals of this game to the amazing music that I find myself listening to even today to even the game's mechanics which I found weren't too bad on PC, I had an amazing time. While yes, some sections of the game were difficult to push through (looking at you Chapter 3), this game teaches you that perseverance and optimism can get you through everything. Even though I still haven't finished the game entirely as I work through Farewell, I keep finding these sentiments expressing themselves through each room I get through. I step into a room and look at it as a daunting hill to climb, but with a few deaths and learning from each one I find myself passing through to continue my journey.\n\nFor those of you who might be scared of this infamously difficult platformer, don't be. I won't be shy to admit it, but I used the assist mode that this game offers and it helped me so much. You can use it to help work through a room at your own pace and allow you to practice before doing it for real with the default settings. I especially used assist mode when trying to figure out how to mechanically make my way through extra content for the game, and it allowed me to be better prepared in terms of timing and mechanics and prevented me from simply calling it quits and moving on from the game.\n\nI highly suggest you play this game if you haven't already, and I'll update this review when I do manage to beat Farewell. 101 hours in and I still haven't beat it, but it's been worth the time I've invested in this game. While I may find myself playing another game once I make this a perfect game, I don't think I'll ever quite be able to bid this game farewell.", "timestamp_created": 1697698035, "timestamp_updated": 1697698035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148473091": {"recommendationid": "148473091", "author": {"steamid": "76561199176394017", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1096, "last_played": 1698469762}, "language": "spanish", "review": "wena musika", "timestamp_created": 1697695757, "timestamp_updated": 1697695757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148472383": {"recommendationid": "148472383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198441792326", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 9100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8532, "last_played": 1698287456}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]Celeste embodies everything I've ever wanted in a platformer[/b][/h1]\nOf the many platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing, this is without a doubt one of the best. \n\nCeleste continuously caught me off guard and presented new obstacles, ranging from the basic mechanics of jumping and climbing to the complicated techniques of dashing, wall-jumping, and using surrounding objects.

at expressing myself through words, but for this game I have to try. \n\nThe reason I bought this game was because I had just finished 101%ing Pizza Tower, and I was looking for a new game to play. I remembered hearing something about Celeste, so I thought I'd check it out. At the time Pizza Tower was my favorite game, and when I downloaded the game, I told myself that no matter what, Pizza Tower was going to remain my favorite game after I played this. \n\nThis game is beautiful. The art and music both go above and beyond, and the gameplay is obviously what makes it so good  and its why people still talk about the game today, but the way Celeste uses its gameplay to empower the story is the thing that I find to be Celeste's biggest strength. The goal of Celeste is to climb a mountain, which is a very difficult task, obviously. But to climb that mountain, the main character, Madeline, has to climb the metaphorical mountain of mental illness. In my case, Celeste was a challenge, and one that I didn't know if I could fulfill. I would have to surpass challenge after challenge, which would be difficult, almost like I was climbing a mountain. But if I wanted to climb Celeste, I'd have to be able to persevere, no matter how difficult it got. Madeline's climb directly parallels the player's; a physical challenge locked behind a mental challenge.\n\nIf you ask me, being bad at video games is the best way to experience Celeste.

Just like carrying my trusty Sasha, it's a heavy load of a challenge, but also a ton of fun.\n\nFirst off, the platforming in this game is a real workout, much like lugging around my beloved minigun. The controls are tight and responsive, just like the precision needed to aim Sasha. Climbing those mountains feels like a never-ending battle, but when you reach the summit, the sense of accomplishment is like the satisfaction of a well-timed headshot.\n\nThe story, much like the lore in Team Fortress 2, unfolds in unexpected ways and keeps you engaged throughout. You'll find yourself caring about the characters and their struggles, much like we do for our fellow mercenaries.\n\nThe pixel art style is quite charming, and the soundtrack is as epic as a Heavy/Medic combo push through the battlefield. The music adds to the adrenaline rush, just like the sound of Sasha's spinning barrels before a showdown.\n\nBut be warned, this game can be as punishing as a crit rocket from the enemy Soldier. You'll die a lot, but it's all part of the learning experience. Just like in TF2, you keep coming back for more, honing your skills, and feeling more powerful with each attempt.\n\nIn conclusion, Celeste is a game that's both challenging and rewarding, just like the life of a Heavy. If you're ready to take on a mountain of a challenge and appreciate a well-crafted indie game, give Celeste a try.

She feels rather weighty in the air which I found annoying at first but after going through the game I can safely say that it was the proper gravity level for the puzzle like platforming this game offers. Each story mission introduces new mechanics that don't overstay their welcome as each mission ends almost immediately after you say \"This Again?\"\n\nThe graphics are 16 bit style and I think it meshes with the game play well. For story segments, chat bubbles between characters have HD sprite work and all the characters have unique enough designs for it to be obvious which speech bubble is correlated to which 16 bit sprite on screen. I will say though that the scenes that are presented during cut scenes invoke much more vividly beautiful imagery than what the limited 16 bit graphics actually show. Weirdly though, the menus feature a 3d rendering of the mountain that you climb in the game, which I personally didn't care much for. It always takes me off guard when I see it.\n\nThe game's story has gained alot of praise for being an accurate representation of what crippling anxiety and split personality disorder is like. I have neither of these things so for me the story wasn't that personally engaging and most importantly I feel it massively contradicts what is presented during game play. During game play the main protagonist is doing physical stunts of acrobatics around very VERY dangerous environments, one would imagine that an individual doing these things would need to be quite brave. But the moment a cut scene starts we are introduced to a protagonist that seems to be barely keeping it together. It's very jarring to say the least. But again, I don't have the afflictions the main protagonist does so perhaps that's just what a day in the life of someone with anxiety is like. Odd though.\n\nOverall I would say the game is absolutely worth your money for the game play alone. Not only does it feature a campaign of decent length, but there is also end game content that I'm certain tests the capabilities of the most hardcore players.", "timestamp_created": 1697369574,

This chapter takes everything great about the game and tosses it away. The game introduces some advanced movement techniques that do not feel consistent or fun to pull off, making every screen feel luck based rather than skill based.

TRANS RIGHTS?????\n\nok serious.\nI started playing Celeste on the Pico-8 version, which I would play in school after finishing my work in compsci (bc it was a really easy class) and I got SUPER into it to the point where I did a run that was completely deathless, except for the last level (I hate that last level)\nA year or so later, I bought the full game. Getting used to the new grab mechanic that I hadn't had before took me a little bit, but it really wasn't a hassle. Getting through the first stage was super similar to the pico-8 version (I'm assuming that it was on purpose) so I got through it well (and my current time on it is 1:58.541, which i am very proud of) but every stage after that added more new and unique mechanics.\n\nI'd be lying if I said that it wasn't insanely difficult, because it was, but I'd also be lying if I said it wasn't easy to grasp. As I've heard someone (I don't remember who) say, \"Celeste is the hardest game that everybody can play\" and that's absolutely true. The mechanics are introduced well, and the level's aren't designed to be hard for the sake of being hard. I think the best was to describe it is \"incredibly challenging, but not hard.\"\n\nBecause of how well the game is designed and how well it teaches you the controls and mechanics, when you die, you don't blame the game for being \"stupid and too hard\", you know that you made the mistake, and you know how to fix it, you just need to practice it and try again. You're always the one responsible for messing up, which actually makes it a lot easier not to rage quit or anything like that. The fact that I know how to fix the mistake that just killed me and I just need to retry, instead of the death just being because the game is needlessly hard, makes it a lot more enjoyable (who knew?) The accessibility options are also wonderful! Even though I don't need it, I feel like a colorblind option would be a good accessibility addition, but all the other accessibility options are phenomenal, and make sure that pretty much anyone can pick up Celeste and start playing!\n\nLastly, I want to mention the more advanced mechanics. I'm not a Celeste speedrunner, as much as I like running the first (and sometimes second) stage, I could never run the whole game. However, I've watched SO many Celeste speedruns and TASes (mostly from diff GDQs, if you want, \n[url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLufeepXLMvnNZsgGoo316Eem0QvnY1Prw]here's a playlist of some of my fave Celeste speedrun vids[/url]) But the fact that there are so many difficult and advanced mechanics, some that spawned from bugs that the (amazing) devs turned into features, is SO so cool. Especially because you don't need to know these advanced mechanics to play. As long as you grasp the basics, you're good! But if you wanna try some other stuff, you can learn these! You also get really proud of yourself when you successfully pull of one of these tricks. I know the first time i did a hyperdash I was pretty proud, and I was ECSTATIC the one (and only) time I successfully did a demodash to skip that area in the hotel. \n\ntl;dr, Celeste is an INCREDIBLE game, and is WONDERFUL for anyone trying to get into precision platformers, or just wanting a cool game to play. The story is great, the music is amazing (shouts out Lena Raine), the dev team is super cool, the community is the absolute greatest, and, most importantly, the game is so SO fun.\n\nTrans rights, long live Archie, and play Celeste!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1697337259, "timestamp_updated": 1697337259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148247303": {"recommendationid": "148247303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327496029", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5107, "last_played": 1697335909}, "language": "spanish", "review": "The hardest game that I ever played, with a good gameplay and enjoy all levels", "timestamp_created": 1697334752, "timestamp_updated": 1697334752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148245354": {"recommendationid": "148245354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181735639", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 426, "last_played": 1697331675}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is peak", "timestamp_created": 1697331708, "timestamp_updated": 1697331708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148244748": {"recommendationid": "148244748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315045879", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1196, "playtime_at_review": 7490, "last_played": 1700706985}, "language": "english", "review": "Ooh Canada", "timestamp_created": 1697330731, "timestamp_updated": 1697330731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148238810": {"recommendationid": "148238810", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075188659", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1697369989}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gran juego.", "timestamp_created": 1697321930, "timestamp_updated": 1697321930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148236694": {"recommendationid": "148236694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798574380", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 798, "last_played": 1691865038}, "language": "english", "review": "You ever heard of the abomination that is \"celesteoidvania\"?

Let's dive into the details of this awe-inspiring journey.\n\nA Symphony of Sensory Delights:\nWhere Celeste truly shines is in its aesthetics and audio. The music is pure magic; I find myself listening to some of these tracks even outside the game. The \"remix\" or B-C sides of the soundtrack are no less masterful, adding an extra layer to the audio experience. The pixel-style graphics are both fitting and visually pleasing. The animations, especially Madeline's idle quirks like sneezing, are charming and demonstrate the developers' keen attention to detail.\n\nA Heartfelt Story:\nThe narrative woven into Celeste is a masterpiece in its own right. It carries a beautiful message and delivers it in a relatable and touching manner. The story is a poignant reminder of the struggles and triumphs in our own lives.\n\nGameplay Dilemmas:\nNow, the gameplay is where Celeste stumbles just a bit. If it were solely the main chapters, Celeste would be near flawless. However, the B-C sides, Core, and Farewell chapters introduce challenges that, while commendable for their ambition, sometimes teeter on the edge of frustration.\n\nLevel-Design Quirks:\nEven within the main chapters, there are occasional hurdles. For instance, Chapter 3 is oddly more challenging than the following chapter, primarily due to its many quick-moving obstacles. Moreover, while the game offers a sense of freedom in movement, certain objects and screens feel out of place and disrupt the flow, especially in Core and Farewell. It's a bit like a puzzle where some pieces just don't fit.\n\nUnintended Freedom and Cheesiness:\nCeleste offers a considerable degree of freedom in how you navigate its levels. However, it sometimes feels like a design oversight rather than intentional choice. The term \"cheese,\" borrowed from the Mario Maker community, is apt here. While some may argue it's a design feature, I can't help but wonder if it's a result of carelessness or poor level design.\n\nGameplay Timing and Respawns:\nCeleste's timed elements can be frustrating. It's not about simply holding right; there's strategy involved. However, waiting half a second after each respawn can accumulate into tedious downtime. This issue becomes even more evident when searching for B-C side cassette tapes, where the timing doesn't reset upon death, leading to unpredictable waiting periods.\n\nSecrets and Their Challenges:\nThe crystal hearts are an engaging and rewarding element, encouraging exploration and careful observation. However, there's room for improvement. For instance, the solution to the Chapter 1 heart becomes a memory test several chapters later, which isn't ideal. Some secrets, particularly the challenging ones, lack proper indications, leading players to miss them entirely.\n\nA Mountain of Difficulty:\nCeleste's difficulty spikes significantly in the B-C sides, Core, and Farewell chapters. While challenging games are enjoyable, the steepness of the curve often crosses the line into unfairness. It transforms the experience into a grind and muscle memory exercise rather than enjoyable gameplay.\n\nA Summit of Main Game:\nThe main part of the game, Madeline's journey to the summit, collecting 175 strawberries and crystal hearts, is easily recommendable. It presents a balanced, challenging, and enjoyable experience that tests your skills without crossing into frustration too much.\n\nExtra Content: The Double-Edged Sword:\nConversely, the B-C sides and Farewell are far less recommendable, in my opinion. They introduce a level of difficulty that transitions from fun to constant frustration. The additional story in Core and Farewell feels somewhat forced and doesn't quite resonate with Madeline's initial mountain-climbing motivation.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Celeste is a gem with its main game and a visual and auditory masterpiece. Its narrative and visuals are emotionally resonant, but the journey becomes a touch turbulent in the extra content. Celeste delivers an incredible experience, but it's in the B-C sides, Core, and Farewell that it sometimes struggles to maintain its balance.\n\nCeleste stands as an essential play for those seeking a poignant narrative, fantastic music, and challenging but fair gameplay. It's a shining example of the incredible experiences that indie games can offer. While it may not reach the grandeur of a AAA title, it's a testament to the creativity and talent within the indie game development community. Celeste may not be a total masterpiece, but it proudly wears the badge of indie excellence.", "timestamp_created": 1697234364, "timestamp_updated": 1697234364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6,

I recently came back to it, as Spotify had been recommending me the games music, not to mention I had become a fan of Lena Raine since initially purchasing the game. Coming back to Celeste was a GREAT decision. I must have gained a newborn appreciation for games out of nowhere, because the platforming felt great and very responsive, the level design was amazing, the levels were difficult to both interpret and play through, but not so difficult that it was frustrating or made you want to give up. To me, Celeste isn't a game about simply climbing a mountain, it is a game that delves into the ideas of anxiety and depression, which are portrayed perfectly by Madeline and Badeline. The portrayal of these ideas just felt extremely realistic, and easy to digest, I'm not quite sure how to explain it. The difficulty of the game, and ESPECIALLY the difficulty of chapter 9 makes you really feel like you are overcoming those anxieties. Lastly, but definitely not last, THE MUSIC. Every bit of music fits in so well with the corresponding section of the game. Lena Raine is an amazing musician, and her music in Celeste is in my opinion, her best work. It accompanies so much emotion and detail, not seen much in video game music. One thing that I noticed and really like, is that Madeline seems to have a leitmotif that represents her, and is present in almost every single song in the soundtrack, but fits in every time and is somehow not overused at all. I also noticed that some of the characters were represented by certain instruments, (Piano: Madeline, Synth: Badeline, Violin: Granny/crow) All of which I feel fit extremely well. I have an in-depth review for Farewell's music but this is already getting kind of long. Overall, Celeste is an amazing game, probably in my top 5 games OAT, and so is the soundtrack. I highly recommend it even if you suck at platformers.

is a story-rich, difficult platforming challenge which is definitely worth the patience. [/h1]\n\nCeleste is presented as a high-difficulty platformer with smooth controls and barely fair level design. The way it's designed makes every challenge seem possible if you give it enough time to master it, and it's forgiving checkpoint system keeps this process steady.\nEvery screen is a possibility to show the skills gained from previous encounters, improve upon them, or gain a further understanding on how the game operates.\nThe struggle of learning to overcome these challenges is also definitely expressed inside the story, being about the overcoming of ones fears by climbing a mountain by embrancing them and accepting themselves thanks to your loved ones around you.\nOr in case of the final chapter (spoilers for the story),[spoiler] dealing with the grief of losing someone you love, finding a way to cope with the fact and ultimately accepting the reality and finding support in those around you, remembering the good times rather than rotting in the sadness. [/spoiler]\nIt would be an understatement to say that Celeste's storytelling is good, with compelling characters and a down to earth meaning, and despite that my memory of the details is fuzzy from the last time I played it, I still recall enjoying myself every step of the way, learning from my mistakes and being able to overcome those difficult challenges.\n\n[h2] 100% [/h2]\n\n100%ing Celeste is quite the ordeal. Although most achievement you get while playing the game normally (Finishing the chapters, [spoiler] finishing the B-Sides and C-Sides [/spoiler]), the ones which you have to go out of your way to get are fairly challenging but you can finish them with enough practice (Getting every Strawberry, Receiving a 1-up and[spoiler] getting the WOW berry in the Farewell Chapter. [/spoiler])\n\n[h2] Recomendation [/h2]\n\nI would recommend Celeste only if you're willing to partake in a challenging platformer and give it the time to master it and get through it to the end. And even if you're not into that sort of thing, the game allows for a multitude of accesibily options to help make the gameplay easier, so you can also get into it solely for the story without needing to worry about being good at platformers.\n\n[h3] TL;DR [/h3]\n[olist]\n    [*]Challening platformer with compelling story.\n    [*]Decently hard achievements due to base game already being difficult.\n    [*]Recommended.\n[/olist]", "timestamp_created": 1696735712, "timestamp_updated": 1696735754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147842667": {"recommendationid": "147842667", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031386282", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 488, "last_played": 1698636716}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Very recommended, but you'll need to get another keyboard after playing this.", "timestamp_created": 1696735698, "timestamp_updated": 1696735698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147842324": {"recommendationid": "147842324", "author": {"steamid": "76561199166215438", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 915, "last_played": 1697585073}, "language": "english", "review": "The platforming is superb and the pixel art is amazing, props to the artists.

Celeste is a special game to me in many ways and is one that I spent time playing both on and off steam. If you are at all a fan of platformer type games with engaging story I highly recommend you pick up a copy for yourself. \n\nWhat does the game do well?\n\n- The Gameplay -  \nThe controls and mechanics are tight and easy to learn but present a nice challenge to master and use efficiently and effectively. After putting well over 60 hours (mostly off steam) I died a lot in this game, however never due to the gameplay/mechanics. I was always able to point to something that I could do/time better on my end and after all that time I can fly through and really enjoy the levels.\n\n- The Art - \nCeleste's pixel art is some of my favorite, though at times quite simplistic, the backgrounds the details, the energy, and oh my gosh the colors are perfect. This game is cute and during the down time sections, incredibly soothing. \n\n- The Music - \nLena Raine, need I say more? 10/10\n\n- The Story - \nCeleste's story is really one about your own journey and overcoming the limitations you place on yourself. It's uplifting and realistic in a way I haven't seen in many games. It's mature but doesn't always take itself too seriously. Also the breathing scene with the feather (you'll know when you see it) is beyond amazing and something I now use in my daily life. The gameplay is definitely the focus here but they made sure not to pull their punches with the story and I love it. \n\n--- TL;DR ---\nThe game is overwhelmingly positive for a reason. If you like platformer games that challenge you without being too punishing, and with optional harder levels, Celeste is a MUST.

Celeste quite a while ago, (maybe even over a year ago), and only got up to about chapter 3 because I got bored. I recently came back to it, as Spotify had been recommending me the games music, not to mention I had become a fan of Lena Raine since initially purchasing the game. Coming back to Celeste was a GREAT decision. I must have gained a newborn appreciation for games out of nowhere, because the platforming felt great and very responsive, the level design was amazing, the levels were difficult to both interpret and play through, but not so difficult that it was frustrating or made you want to give up. To me, Celeste isn't a game about simply climbing a mountain, it is a game that delves into the ideas of anxiety and depression, which are portrayed perfectly by Madeline and Badeline. The portrayal of these ideas just felt extremely realistic, and easy to digest, I'm not quite sure how to explain it. The difficulty of the game, and ESPECIALLY the difficulty of chapter 9 makes you really feel like you are overcoming those anxieties. Lastly, but definitely not last, THE MUSIC. Every bit of music fits in so well with the corresponding section of the game. Lena Raine is an amazing musician, and her music in Celeste is in my opinion, her best work. It accompanies so much emotion and detail, not seen much in video game music. One thing that I noticed and really like, is that Madeline seems to have a leitmotif that represents her, and is present in almost every single song in the soundtrack, but fits in every time and is somehow not overused at all. I also noticed that some of the characters were represented by certain instruments, (Piano: Madeline, Synth: Badeline, Violin: Granny/crow) All of which I feel fit extremely well. I have an in-depth review for Farewell's music but this is already getting kind of long. Overall, Celeste is an amazing game, probably in my top 5 games OAT, and so is the soundtrack. I highly recommend it even if you suck at platformers.

La dificultad del juego escala notablemente, as\u00ed como la implicaci\u00f3n del jugador en el juego y la historia que lo envuelve. Esto dio lugar a uno de los momentos m\u00e1s \u00fanicos y especiales que he tenido como jugador en mi vida.\nCeleste tiene todo lo que un buen juego de su genero puede tener. Unos gr\u00e1ficos y estilo art\u00edstico totalmente creados a mano, por amor al arte de los pixeles. Una narrativa dulce y cautivadora, con la que el jugador puede empatizar, si no sentirse cercano a los sucesos que ocurren, siendo un reflejo de lo que uno puede haber pasado, o estar pasando. Una dificultad realmente justa, en la que el jugador puede sentirse en la amplia mayor\u00eda de casos culpable de todos los errores que comete, d\u00e1ndole la capacidad de mejorar y mejorar hasta lograr pasar una pantalla. Una banda sonora impecable, que se har\u00e1 hueco en tu memoria por el resto de los tiempos, junto a la historia que est\u00e1 adherida, y junto a la experiencia que uno pasa cuando juega Celeste.\nCon numerosas pantallas, coleccionables, rutas ocultas y peligrosas, e incluso mundos totalmente completos con caras B y caras C por cada nivel para aquellos que buscan la excelencia y la maestr\u00eda de sus habilidades, Celeste no se queda atr\u00e1s en lo que es contenido. Adem\u00e1s, a lo largo del tiempo se han ido implementado DLCs, ahora gratis para todos los usuarios, que incluyen hasta 2 nuevos mundos, cada uno con sus rutas ocultas, coleccionables y caras B y C. Eso es, tambi\u00e9n, sin contar la incre\u00edble y acogedora comunidad de desarrolladores que siguen creando contenido personalizado adicional para el juego.\nEn Celeste, solo el jugador puede poner donde est\u00e1 el final. Uno puede terminar la campa\u00f1a principal y darse por satisfecho, o puede atreverse a ir a los mundos posteriores, mucho m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles, pero cuya \u00fanica recompensa, la de autosuficiencia, autodeterminaci\u00f3n y orgullo por uno mismo al llegar a la pantalla final, es lo suficiente como para empujar la valent\u00eda del jugador a seguir fallando, volviendolo a intentar, hasta poder batir cualquier cosa que se le enfrente.\n\nFinalmente, la historia de Celeste, potenciada por su banda sonora y conducida por su gameplay dif\u00edcil y adictivo, es lo que hace brillar a este juego. Uno nunca se da por satisfecho y siempre siente la necesidad de poder mejorar con cada pantalla, mundo o cara. La historia de Celeste habla de la autodeterminaci\u00f3n, el orgullo de uno mismo, la valent\u00eda para afrontar los miedos de uno, y, sobre todo, la persistencia y el control de uno mismo para lograr siempre salir mejor que antes. Habla de afrontar la depresi\u00f3n, el miedo y la baja autoestima, la no confianza de uno mismo y la representaci\u00f3n del odio de uno as\u00ed mismo; Madeline (la protagonista de la historia) es, en muchos casos, un reflejo de la superaci\u00f3n personal y es esto mismo lo que se refleja en el jugador cuando este se siente inmerso, cuando es uno con el juego y lo que pretende ense\u00f1ar.\n\nNo todos los juegos son para todo el mundo. Y los plataformeros no son precisamente la excepci\u00f3n. Si acaso, lo contrario. Sin embargo, Celeste pone a tu disposici\u00f3n numerosas herramientas de asistencia para poder transportar la adrenalina, historia, banda sonora y experiencia de juego a todo tipo de jugadores, tanto aquellos con discapacidades, como aquellos que solo pueden permitirse jugar juegos de forma casual, o aquellos con PCs de bajo rendimiento. Es bajo este pretexto y bajo las herramientas de asistencia ofrecidas por los desarrolladores de Celeste, que puedo decir con cierta certeza que Celeste puede llegar a ser un juego para todos.\n\nEs con su dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico, con su banda sonora, con su adictivo y pulido gameplay, y con su gran cuidada y presentada historia que, creo que se puedo afirmar que Celeste es uno de los pocos juegos \"perfectos\" que uno puede encontrarse en el mundo de los videojuegos, en concreto, en el g\u00e9nero de plataformas.\n\nPor lo menos lo suficiente como para no poder sentirme peor despu\u00e9s de haber completado el juego en una copia pirata del juego, lo que me hizo indudablemente comprar una copia aqu\u00ed en Steam, por respeto a los desarrolladores y la alt\u00edsima calidad de este juego.\n\nDefinitivamente, Celeste es un juego especial. Un juego con el potencial de cambiar la percepci\u00f3n de las personas, e incluso la vida de otras; como es mi caso, y la de otros muchos m\u00e1s.", "timestamp_created": 1696198978, "timestamp_updated": 1696199368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147467781": {"recommendationid": "147467781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198964643004", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2274, "last_played": 1696456968}, "language": "english", "review": "great game, great soundtrack, great community. 10/10.

Aunque mi experiencia en este t\u00edtulo es limitada, y no creo que continue jugando, no puedo evitar maravillarme ante su belleza y encanto.\n\nDesde el momento en que te adentras en el mundo de Celeste, te ver\u00e1s inmerso en una experiencia de juego que destila amor y cuidado en cada p\u00edxel. Sus gr\u00e1ficos pixelados, aunque simples, logran transmitir una sensaci\u00f3n de calidez y nostalgia que te atrapa de inmediato. Los colores y el dise\u00f1o de los escenarios son simplemente impresionantes, creando un ambiente cautivador que te sumerge en la historia.\n\nLa m\u00fasica en Celeste merece una menci\u00f3n especial. La banda sonora es una obra maestra que complementa perfectamente la experiencia de juego. Cada nota musical te sumerge a\u00fan m\u00e1s en la narrativa emocional de la protagonista y te conecta profundamente con su viaje personal.\n\nLa jugabilidad es excepcional. Los controles son precisos y receptivos, lo que te permite realizar movimientos y acrobacias con facilidad. A medida que avanzas en los desafiantes niveles de plataformas, la sensaci\u00f3n de logro al superar obst\u00e1culos y resolver acertijos es gratificante y adictiva.\n\nLa historia de Celeste, que sigue el viaje de Madeline en busca de autodescubrimiento y superaci\u00f3n personal, es conmovedora y te hace sentir identificado con los desaf\u00edos y obst\u00e1culos de la vida real. Aunque mi tiempo en el juego es limitado, puedo ver claramente que esta narrativa est\u00e1 cuidadosamente tejida en la jugabilidad y los escenarios, lo que crea una experiencia verdaderamente inmersiva.\n\nEn resumen, y repito, aunque solo llevo 6 horas de juego en Celeste y no he completado muchos de los logros, puedo decir sin duda que es un t\u00edtulo precioso que merece toda la atenci\u00f3n que recibe. Su belleza visual y musical, junto con su jugabilidad desafiante y su historia conmovedora, lo convierten en una experiencia de juego que no querr\u00e1s perderte. \u00a1Celeste es una obra maestra en todos los sentidos por mas que no me gusten los juegos de plataformas!", "timestamp_created": 1695916538, "timestamp_updated": 1695916538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147214813": {"recommendationid": "147214813", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031031667", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 420, "last_played": 1697827164}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta bueno, compralo", "timestamp_created": 1695914221, "timestamp_updated": 1695914221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147200227": {"recommendationid": "147200227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227398704", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "playtime_at_review": 2465, "last_played": 1700436444}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1695901128, "timestamp_updated": 1695901128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147185259": {"recommendationid": "147185259", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121847344", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 764, "last_played": 1669682107}, "language": "english", "review": "A very cute and niche platformer.

Ironically if you have anxiety problems this game might not be for you. Precise 2D platforming has never been my strong suit, but I've played similar titles to the end no problem. This game ultimately frustrated me more than it entertained me, and in a world with plenty of other games to play, that meant this was one of the few games in the last 10 years I dropped without finishing.\n\nMost impressive thing the game has going are the controls, the devs really took a simple system and milked it for all it was worth. Each added layer of complexity makes for better puzzles that make sense. The problem is replicating perfect movements over and over for me gets frustrating, and when you finish a hard section I'm sure most will feel accomplished, I was just glad it was over. Still, even then I could always see what I did wrong. Props on that.\n\nI like Madeline and think her struggle with anxiety and wanting to move forward is compelling. I just hate all of the other characters. I think Theo sucks, especially as a comic relief character, he has greater depths at points but ultimately annoys the hell out of me. The entire hotel section with Mr. Oshiro got really grating over time, and it went on far too long. The old woman is a jerk.\n\nA mix of frustration with gameplay and general dislike of most of the cast just made me not care about the rest of the story.\n\nMusic is good, but gets repetitive to the point where I had to turn it off at points.\n\nLevel design is good for the most part, but there are points you can just tell the game devs made a platform a little too short or put some pitfall or spike trap in one place just to mess with you. Each stage goes on waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. There are rooms where perfection is required for 4-5+ minutes and that's just not fun in a game where one false move means death.\n\nThis is a good game, its really just not for me.

Yes, the controls are responsive, the music is fine, and a story does kinda exist. I will also say that Celeste, unlike other games of similiar difficulty, is not very punishing or rage-inducing, instead actually being supportive to an extent (which I'll admit is rather refreshing). Also, it does have some obscure mechanics and tricks that may make this game more interesting to speedrunners or those wanting to learn how to speedrun. But that's the extent of my genuine praise for the game, since even the controls are limited and thus problematic (in my opinion) since, at least by default, the dashes can only go in the 8 directions available to a keyboard (which is why this is one of the few platformers where I don't recommend using a controller). In essence, all my complaints really boil down to not finding anything while playing that made it stick out from the pack. While the game isn't broken, there are just so many better alternatives to what I personally experienced with Celeste. Everything that is praised about this game is simply done better elsewhere (in my opinion), and there are some platformers that I consider to be strictly better in every way. For instance, many games out there could correctly claim to have controls that are just as smooth and responsive. Beyond that, most of those games even have more features to the average player! Honestly, it isn't hard to feel responsive when the effective toolset for the majority of players is so limited (despite some complex interactions that can result from them). Furthermore, the supposedly great story isn't very engaging or enthralling at the start either. The game is not as insanely hard as it is made out to be as well. As a completionist, I died more at the beginning due to checking whether the map continued in a direction (looking for secrets/collectibles) than because of any actual mechanical challenge. Simply put, my motivation for playing the game died really quickly after learning that the game was going to continue with pretty much more of the same (except with some subtle variations and a few story elements thrown in). To anyone still interested, I suggest playing the first chapter or two and seeing if you like it. If you do, then continue on knowing that the game will continue giving experiences close to that and enjoy it. For the others like me, I suggest switching to any of the wide variety of more worthy games or other ways to spend your time. TLDR: The gameplay and experience doesn't significantly change much from the first two chapters, so if you are interested in Celeste I would advise giving them a try and basing the decision of whether to continue playing or refund it (if possible) based on how much you enjoy them.", "timestamp_created": 1695546264, "timestamp_updated": 1695546264, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460251063108444214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146912533": {"recommendationid": "146912533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986631628", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1692856920}, "language": "english", "review": "Celeste made me trans\n10/10 would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1695537432, "timestamp_updated": 1695537561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146907985": {"recommendationid": "146907985", "author": {"steamid": "76561199045862165", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 468, "playtime_at_review": 658, "last_played": 1700716114}, "language": "english", "review": "good game innit", "timestamp_created": 1695530634, "timestamp_updated": 1695530634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146906428": {"recommendationid": "146906428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198206013", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 3268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1268, "last_played": 1696293068}, "language": "english", "review": "PLEASE play this game oh my god.

"review": "This is one of the best platformers ever made, well worth it's money, for the reasons listed down:\n\nMECHANICS:\nAs far as Madeline is concerned, her move set is apparently limited to jumping and dashing, however, those can be used in countless ways, taylored towards casual player  and speedrunners alike. Those mainly stem from conservation of momentum, and make possible moves like hyper / reverse / extended super, wavedashes, and also some about hitbox interactions.  As a result the gameplay seems fun, leaving choise to the player, for a beginner to inch their way forward while advanced players slingshot themselves through the room.\nMore variation is added through the vast asortment of items Madeline can interract with, which are dependant on the level and keep the game always feeling fresh and push its boudaries for extracting novelty from level design. Everybody can find a favourite from those. The level design is really a strong point here.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nMake no mistake, the game is very difficult, but it always gives the impression that everything can be done eventually with enough practice. That's mainly because it feels very fair, forgiving to the player  through a lot of coyote timings: basically the basic jump, a lot of moves on the ground, and some near missed collisions that would cause loss of momentum. Also, the difficulty ramps up in a manageable manner, clearly a lot of testing stand behind it. Respawns are fast, putting you straight back into the action. \nI like the B and C sides being stand-alone, different levels, separated from the main story, as it allows players to choose how much difficulty they cam handle. In a similar vein, strawberries may not be pursued, but they always exist highlighting their good level design. Golden berries also for the insane people among us.\n\nSTORY:\nThe story is arguably not the main focus of the game, however it is charming and touching, exploring the mind field of Madeline's anxiety driven mind as well as witnessing her fostering relationships with the other characters. The main metaphore, her personified self doubt works nicely with the feeling of freedom given by her coming to terms with it, awarding the double dash.\n\nMUSIC\nThe music is beautiful. For me it made the whole ordeal of trying over and over feel calmer, more relaxing.\n\nMISC\nPICO-8 is cute ngl.\nThe assist mode exists for players wanting to experience the game without frustration, but it, in my opinion, make the player feel like cheating, like they took the easy way out. Perhaps a better name would make it appear less handholding.", "timestamp_created": 1695434068, "timestamp_updated": 1695434068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146822956": {"recommendationid": "146822956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143214899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1400, "last_played": 1677381195}, "language": "english", "review": "i hate this game", "timestamp_created": 1695432021, "timestamp_updated": 1695432021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146822955": {"recommendationid": "146822955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198828560277", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1699842902}, "language": "english", "review": "fun & emotional game... it is very exciting & nerveracking at times\n\nplus i relate too much to her :D", "timestamp_created": 1695432017, "timestamp_updated": 1695432017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146822178": {"recommendationid": "146822178", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076256757", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 1437, "last_played": 1699681872}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego me encanto demasiado.\nEl arte, la m\u00fasica, y la historia de autosuperaci\u00f3n me conmovi\u00f3.\nCeleste es uno de los juegos que me hizo sentir muchas emociones a la vez tambi\u00e9n, morir demasiadas veces es parte del juego xD, y aun as\u00ed te estreses, da una vibra, un sentimiento que te dice \"hey, no te rindas a\u00fan.

Gracias a TOWERFALL ASCENSION, un multijugador de estos que te hacen perder los amigos, ya me habia ense\u00f1ado su saber hacer en juegos de plataformas / accion lateral. Pero este CELESTE es algo mucho mas grande, de estos juegos que estan pensados de principio a fin, sin aristas. Una maravilla.\n\nSin saber muy bien porque, estas a la ladera de una monta\u00f1a, encarnando a una adolescente, que ha decido darle sentido a su vida culminando la cima de este enorme predusco. Por el camino, sin entrar en spoiler, conoceremos a un variado repertorio de personajes que nos haran enfrentarnos a nuestros miedos y dudas. Aunque el guion por momento puede hacer sonrojar, tiene un trasfondo original y que pocas veces encontraremos en un video juego.\n\nEl punto fuerte, sin lugar a dudas, es su matematica jugabilidad. Partiendo de la base aportada por SUPER MEAT BOY hace decenios, este CELESTE mezcla la formula con puzzles, mapas de roguelite y miles de secretos. Los controles, sufren de una inercia similar al SMB, pero los lleva a un punto mas alla con un dash y muchisima variedad de situaciones. Tienes que jugarlo, cada nivel es una sorpresa. Ademas, te da hasta donde le pidas, cuanto mas dificultad le pides, es capaz de dartela, pero de manera medida. Solo tiene un pero, y es que las mecanicas de muelles (nubes, plataformas que explotan) se notan menos pulidas que el resto, y cuesta demasiado acostumbrarse a ellas.\n\nA nivel tecnico, tiene un colorido soberbio, con una paleta de colores amplisima, que se ve reflejada en la extensa variedad de escenarios. Y por sino tuvieras bastante, la comunidad en NEXUS MODS, ha creado biomas aparte de los que vienen en el propio juego. Echale un vistazo en youtube a los mods y a los speedrun.\n\nLo tienes que probar, porque es un agujero de gusano, al que le puedes dedicar horas, pero lo principal, es que como \"juego\" es una maravilla. De principio a final.\n\n[b]\n\ud83d\udcf1 Funciona en batidoras\n\n\ud83c\udfae o \u2328\ufe0f Elige lo que prefieras\n\n\ud83d\udd35 3W y la grafica al minimo en la deck\n\n\ud83d\udc6a Lo disfrutara toda la familia\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Perfecto para Busca-Logros\n\ud83c\udf81 Bundleado, buscalo en [url=https://www.steamtrades.com/]STEAMTRADES[/url]\n[/b]\n[i]\nS\u00edguenos [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/2535301/]aqu\u00ed[/url] y ay\u00fadanos con nuestro mentor \ud83e\udd1f\nValora para que llegue a m\u00e1s gente, gracias! \ud83d\udc4d\n[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1695033166, "timestamp_updated": 1695033205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146522563": {"recommendationid": "146522563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118696763", "num_games_owned": 912, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 628, "last_played": 1695603711}, "language": "english", "review": "Makes me mad, but story and mechanics are solid\nThe post game game also makes me angry, but its fulfilling!", "timestamp_created": 1695027128, "timestamp_updated": 1695246090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146520949": {"recommendationid": "146520949", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467004628", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 886, "last_played": 1699786059}, "language": "english", "review": " I wish I was girl fr fr", "timestamp_created": 1695023671, "timestamp_updated": 1695023671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146518722": {"recommendationid": "146518722", "author": {"steamid": "76561199178951683", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2186, "last_played": 1695785963}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 .

There were many times I had to walk away. Many times I messaged a friend who also played asking what sort of masochistic psychopath decided anything this hard needed to exist. But when you finally get through every challenge this game throws at you, that \"i can do hard things\" feeling is overwhelmingly satisfying. You really feel so proud of yourself and the story only adds to that satisfaction.  \nThis game is for anyone. It's great for those looking for a new challenge.

It has certainly earned its impeccable reputation.\n\nI found the story charming and Madeline, as a character, grew on me quickly. There are some visually stunning segments and great musical pieces that just nail the atmosphere. The final push up the mountain really had my blood pumping and I couldn't put the game down!\n\nI did find myself getting frustrated with a few levels... but that probably has more to do with me being stubborn. Choosing to repeatedly bash my head into a wall rather than take a break when needed.\n\nThe game could have probably explained a few mechanics better, or allowed a better view of a few levels so the player could plan their jumps... but as you can probably tell by now: the only bad things I have to say are small nitpicks.

It's one of those games that prove video games should be considered as art. \nBasically, Celeste is a tiny little game that teaches you to be patient with yourself and learn from your mistakes. You're gonna die a lot figuring your way up a mountain. Hopefully with each death you learn what do to do and how to do it, so you can reach the summit. That's basically the game; You climb despite numerous obstacles that are on your way. The starting mechanics are as simple as it gets: You can jump, hold onto walls and dash. The game successfully tries to keep things fresh with adding new mechanics and different type of obstacles in each section of the game. There'll be many challenging parts in the game but if you give yourself enough time to think and rest, it'll never become frustrating and believe me, you'll feel great after overcoming challenges that at first appeared to be impossible to get through.\nDespite the story being a simple one, it's really impactful and memorable.

My very first playthrough I believe was in 2020 on the Nintendo Switch, and I remember beating the base game, liking it, and shoving it into the back of my brain. I HEAVILY regret this because Celeste, while incredibly difficult at times, is one of the best games I have EVER PLAYED, and I play a lot of games. \n\nIn this second PC playthrough, I decided to take my time, as I planned to get every achievement in the game without using assist mode ONCE. I'll say, I was seriously tempted to use it, especially at parts like b-side chapter 7, c-side chapter 8, and who could forget the classic Chapter 9. No joke, Farewell is one of the HARDEST challenges I have EVER faced in a video game. It's up there with the Pantheon of Hallownest from Hollow Knight and the Malenia boss fight from Elden Ring in terms of difficulty. What made it more difficult is that I tried to get the Moonberry BEFORE I beat Farewell normally, which made beating it EVEN MORE OF A PAIN.\n\nNevertheless, after 12,000 total deaths, 44 total hours, and multiple rage quits, I got every achievement in Celeste, fairly. Even with that being said, I doubt I am truly done with this amazing game. I still have Variant mode to play around with, attempts at speedruns, and if I'm feeling truly masochistic, the Golden strawberries. Even if you aren't interested in 100%ing games, it's still a great 2D platformer with an amazingly written story.

Celeste is a hard game and it knows it.  Right from the start it offers a challenge, but it gives you the tools to overcome those challenges.  The dash in Celeste is probably my favorite movement option in any game.  The wide variety of movement options that it provides makes for such a fast and fun ride.  You can fly across large gaps, you can launch yourself off of a ledge to another that seemed just out of reach moments ago, you are capable of incredible things.  That's what Celeste is all about; it's about you overcoming your own doubts and climbing your own mountain.  Some may find it easier than others, but comparing isn't the point.  Learning how to overcome things at your own pace and taking your time is what it's all about.  Of course there's a lot more than that along the way, mostly rage and sadness.  Celeste is about the journey, and through it's incredible story and characters you'll see Madeline's journey.

I've reached 69 hours, it's time to write a review.\n\nCeleste is one of the best games of all time. You come for its unique atmosphere (established by the cute pixel art graphics, unforgettable characters, and amazing music), you stay for the platforming challenge.\n\nCeleste has a learning curve like no other game. The first time you play the first chapter, you die hundreds of times. A month later, you can do it completely deathless. The first time you attempt a B-side stage, you think it's impossible, designed for superhumans and robots. A month later, you've beaten all of them. I once thought the Summit was impossibly hard. Then I thought Summit B-side was impossibly hard. Nowadays, I think C-side is impossibly hard and so is Farewell. Maybe soon I'll look back at this review and chuckle.\n\nGetting better at the game involves a lot of dying, but it rarely feels unfair. You always get taught everything you need ahead of time. It's a matter of perfecting your inputs. If you want to accelerate the process, I recommend increasing your estrogen dose. Also, a bad controller can really hold you back, since you may need to switch between horizontal, vertical, and diagonal inputs frequently in the fraction of a second.\n\nEvery time you beat a stage you once thought was impossible, you'll feel a joy that few other things can provide,\nYou all should play this game if you want to experience personal growth, as a gamer or just as a human.\n\nAddendum: If you're out of things to do in the base game, I recommend giving the Strawberry Jam mod a try.", "timestamp_created": 1694122532, "timestamp_updated": 1694122532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145874357": {"recommendationid": "145874357", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247611759", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2656, "last_played": 1660760249}, "language": "english", "review": "This is unironically my all time favorit game.

And here is why. Firstly, let me point out that I have played a lot of this game. I mostly play mods nowadays, but I'm currently grinding doing all the levels deathless. This review will be mostly spoiler free, but a few level mechanics will be brought up.\n\nMECHANICS\n\nCeleste is a relatively simply platforming game at first glance, until you take a closer look. You have a few abilities at your disposal. You have your basic jump and walk, you can climb walls and jump between them, and you have a dash, which can be used on the ground or in the air. SImple, right? But one of the things that makes this game great is that the developers know what the people want. And what the people want is speed. There is NO speed cap in Celeste. Nada. Zilch. And there are many ways to build up speed. So you can get going really fast. Now I couls spend a lot of time talking about the different tech you can do, such as a reverse extended hyperdash bunnyhop into a double block boosted chained ultra. (Which is tech only used in the hardest of the hard mods.) But that stuff can be learned on your own time. \n\nSTORY\n\nHooo, Boi. Celeste has got one heck of a story. I'll keep this spoiler free, but simply put, it is the story of someone climbing a literal mountain while struggling with a mental mountain at the same time. Madeline, our protagonist, sets out to climb a mountain to show that she can do anythings. But the mountain isn't any ordinary mountain. It brings out the worst in people. So while climbing she has to deal with her internal turmoil being physically manifested around her. And, I could be wrong on this, I'm pretty sure its also a personal story about the developer.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN\n\nCeleste has some really briliiant mechanics in each level, and all the levels are quite pretty. Besides your relatively generic platformer mechanics, such as wind or ice, there are also some really unique ones, like blocks that move when you dash, or my personal favorite, Kevin. Kevins, whenever you hit them move towards the direction you hit them from. You hit them on their right side, they move right. But they look hilarious. And some of the secrets are really well hidden. Too be completely honest, I did use a walkthrough in my first playthrough, but only for the stuff I missed, which waas a lot. There are even a handful of puzzle secrets.\n\nDEVELOPERS\n\nCeleste has some of the best developers of any game I have seen. Period. They listen to their community, and react based on that. For some examples, when the Farewell Update came a while back, the developers added a few things to cater to players and the community. Firstly, in the new level they added, there were a few really secret rooms that showed off some speedrun tech that had been discovered which wasn't intentional. There is a whole puzzle hidden in farewell that, when completed, will reveal some of the biggest names on the Celeste community. And lastly, my favorite, is the secret Kevin save. (I like Kevins, OK?) A few years back, there was a TAS that was made for Celeste. (For those who don't know, a TAS is basically a player playing the game one frame at a time.) The TASsers had changed the Kevins to make a noise that sounded like, Fwuhuhu, or Fwahaha. The developers found this hilarious, so when they updated the game, they added a hidden save name that would make them say this noise. For those who are curious, the save name is FWAHAHA.\n\nMODS\n\nIf you have finished this game and are hungry for more, then let me tell you, there is a ton of mods to play. And they can get a lot harder then your regular old Celeste. I would highly recommend, if you are starting to mod to get the Strawberry Jam Mod, Speedrun Tool, and Monika's D Sides. Monika's D sides are a pretty hard  mod, harder than any part of regular Celeste, and really fun. Speedrun Tool is a almost essential tool that lets you make savestates. This is helpful for longer rooms when you need to practice the end bit. And finally, Strawberry Jam. This mod is MASSIVE. There are over 100 levels, 100+ custom songs, was worked on by 300+ developers, and offers a wide range of difficulty, from beginner to advanced to Grandmaster to GM+1.\n\nOTHER CRITIQUES I HAVE SEEN OF THIS GAME\n\nLastly, I feel that it is necessary to discuss the negative reviews that I have seen. There are two common complaint: Accessibility and Difficulty. Firstly, accessibilty. There is some fair complaint in here. One, there is no colorblind mode. Now, I am color blind myself, (Yellows and Greens, Blues and Purples.) but I didn't have any trouble. However, it is quite possible that it could impede you playing the level, especially for darker ones like chapter 5. There is also one color based puzzle in the game, which can be trouble some when colorblind. Second, the keyboard controls. This game was  rather noticably designed for controller. This is really obvious in the feather mechanic. In chapter 6, you get accsess to a feather which will give you flight and 360 degree movement for a short time. This, when starting out, can be really hard to work on keyboard. HOWEVER. I would highly recommend playing on keyboard for one simple reason. Diagonal dashes. (For note here, I have fully beaten the game on both an Xbox and my PC.) Digonals are really hard to do on controlller, and will often send you right or up instead. And in the last chapter of the game it teaches you a tech called wavedashes. Wavedashes are a movement technique where you dash diagonally down into the ground and then jump. This gives you a big speed boost and is a required part of Farewell. This. was. TORTURE. on controller. (As a sidenote, I saw one reviewer complaining about the inconsistency of the tech, and I can tell you that with a bit of practice, it it extrememly consistent. After I finished Farewell on PC, I almost never failed it again.) If you enjoy this game and are/eill be considering modding it, you want keyboard. Precision is the name of the game, and controllers just don't bring that too the table. Other then this accesssibility issues, the game is pretty good at working for all types of players, and even has an assist mode if you find the game to be too hard.\n\nWhich brings us to the second complaint: DIfficulty. Don't get me wrong, Celeste is a really hard game. And you are going to die a lot. I died probably 20k times on my first playthrough, and have probabl died 200k+ times now. But it is not absurdly/ Kaizo level hard. And if you are struggling, use assist mode. Its ok to use it. Its what its there for.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis was a rather long review, so I'll take my leave now, hoping that I convinced somebody to play this masterpiece. It wil be hard, and sometime it will feel like you are not making any progress and keep falling down to the bottom of the mountain. But if you keep trying, you will find a great view waiting for you at the top.\n\nGood Luck.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1693720869, "timestamp_updated": 1693720869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63,

(I will try not to spoil) Celeste is a game with a chapter like format, where you go into different levels each containing rooms. The levels have different theming and mechanics. So lets talk about level design. I'm no level designer, but each level is great! If you watch a speedrun, you will see how free these levels are if you have enough skill, but for the casual player, there is always a normal route. Story in this game is amazing. I won't say much more for the sake of spoilers, but it's a great story that's well integrated into the game. Now the elephant in the room. Movement. This is a 2D platformer, so the movement is the #1 priority, and I'm glad to say this is the best 2d movement i've used. Let me explain. You have 3 actions (other than walk) jump, climb, and dash. While very simple mechanics, they can make the most advanced movement mechanics when combined. If you use them normally, they are very simple, but useful, but by combining, say a dash and jump, you will get flung pretty far. There are so many other movement mechanics that I wont say here. Overall, jumping feels natural, and walking is at a good speed, and the game has many forgiving mechanics that make it feel good. The challenge of the game is very well there, and for me personally, it took me 10-12 hours to beat the game the first time, but after learning the movement and rooms properly, I could do it in around 2 hours. The devs are amazing, and support the community, as well as do what's best for the game, and the community is also amazing. This is an amazing game, and I would suggest learning to speedrun or mod/make maps for the game after beating it. It's a good time.
