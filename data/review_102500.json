I have no idea why it took so long, because it's a good game ! It has aged, though, so someone looking to play it now should probably look at its \"Re-Reckoning\" version.\n\nWhat drew me into the game was its artistic direction. I thought the movements, visual effects and character designs looked very, very cool and unique. I chose my class and weapons based solely on how they looked. That said, KoAR offers much more than that.\n\nCombat does looks cool and flows nicely, you very quickly get how your weapons and combos work, and it is a pleasure to play. I recommend the normal difficulty, as the lowest one really trivializes some encounters to an absurd degree. (But obviously you know what's best for you.)\n\nKoAR is also a very complete RPG with a lot of freedom. You can completely change your class at any time, mix diferent classes, and also change your utility abilities ! (Things like crafting, lockpicking...) There are several questlines that you can follow in any order (up to a point of no return), you can resolve quests in a number of ways... You are told narratively that you have choices, and the gameplay truly delivers on that.\n\nThe story starts as a generic Chosen One plot, but with the twist that you're special only because you died and were resurrected. And as you progress the story and learn more, you realise that all is not what it seems, and several assumptions that were made about you may be slightly off or completely wrong. So in the end, while the plot is nothing extraordinary, it is not as bland as it might seem.\n\nThere are LOTS of areas to explore, all beautiful and different, and while a lot of NPC are generic, there is originality in the quests you get, the people you meet, and the world itself. It did not feel like just another fantasy world, a lot of research and creativity went into it. The fact that you learn about the lore by listening to lorestones rather than read about it was also a smart choice.\n\nThere are issues with the game, but most are due to its age. There are some bugs that can prevent quest progression, but you can find ways to avoid them on the internet. The DLC aren't really tied to the main story but they're very enjoyable as standalone stories.\n\nSo all in all it was a good game, and it deserved more attention than what I gave it. I really encourage you to play its remastered version if you're interested. I'm tempted to buy it myself and play the game properly this time.", "timestamp_created": 1699214753, "timestamp_updated": 1699214753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542132198810577393", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149223025": {"recommendationid": "149223025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050345070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 111, "playtime_at_review": 1712, "last_played": 1699926073}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1698709201, "timestamp_updated": 1698709201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149087535": {"recommendationid": "149087535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061197463", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5179, "last_played": 1699491405}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like WoW 2, offline MMO.

La calidad es parecido al de un MMO, por ejemplo, una zona boscosa es amplia y grande con poco detalle y las proporciones y estilo de los enemigos tambi\u00e9n recuerdan a los de un MMO.\n\nLa variedad de enemigos y recursos es peque\u00f1a, encontraras las mismas plantas y enemigos ya est\u00e9s en el bosque o en el desierto.

Sin embargo, las misiones con la categor\u00eda de tareas se acaban por hacer arduas. Deje de hacerlas tras llegar a la tercera zona del juego, la simplicidad del entorno y los repetitivos enemigos le quitan la gracia a estas misiones/tareas ya que no sienten que est\u00e9s encontrando nuevos desaf\u00edos o descubriendo algo nuevo. \n\nPor otro lado, la jugabilidad es muy divertida con combinaciones de ataques que requieren de habilidad y de escoger el momento justo, sin embargo, incluso en la mayor dificultad que te deja escoger el juego se hace excesivamente f\u00e1cil. No quita esto el placer del combate ya que aunque no haga ninguna falta que tengas finura alguna al combatir, es muy satisfactorio matar a un grupo de enemigos con los golpes justos, habiendo bloqueado todos los ataques hacia tu persona.\n\nEn definitiva, merece la pena. La historia principal y el mundo creado son interesantes aunque no de la calidad de otros juegos como Dragon Age, pero desde luego le he sacado las pesetas al juego con 62 horas de juego habiendo completado la historia principal y todas las secundarias que me he encontrado con gusto. Aunque ya al final no me quedaban muchas ganas de seguir echando horas al juego.\n\nPor ultimo, si el juego te acaba absorbiendo m\u00e1s que a mi, estoy seguro que le podr\u00e1s sacar muchas m\u00e1s horas que yo.", "timestamp_created": 1687875302, "timestamp_updated": 1687875302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140739035": {"recommendationid": "140739035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101064176", "num_games_owned": 973, "num_reviews": 197, "playtime_forever": 6280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6280, "last_played": 1639775182}, "language": "english", "review": "Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is an action RPG game developed by Big Huge Games and 38 Studios, and published by Electronic Arts.

The weapons and armour variety is insane, and you will often catch yourself play digital dress up. Battles and powers are flashy with a lot of colours and effects jumping out of the screen in a vibrant glorious mess. The audio is passable, nothing that really sets its apart. Music does a good job at suspending your awe or making you feel like God amongst mortal, as the situation demands.\n\nPLOT AND WORLD BUILDING:\nThe very name of the game gives hints about what you can expect from the game: needless padding. The main story itself is serviceable but the game tries to pull a James Cameron and over-saturate itself with characters and plot threads that end abruptly. There are plenty of times you will be paying attention to a lore dump given by the NPC, thinking it will be important but its importance just ends after the side quest is over. There are so many characters and \"heroes\" that pop up with their own expositions (which are long and windy) but then disappear completely off the face of the map after you finish whatever quest was associated with it. The game tries very hard to provide a deep lore but does absolutely nothing to sustain the legacy of its own characters and events. So the game becomes an exercise in jumping from one exposition to another collecting names that will never turn up again. \n\nTo be fair, they made an honest go at the world building. It is a shame that they chose quantity over quality. If someone picks up this IP again, I hope they cut off the fat because I see great potential.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAfter the first few hours you will begin to realise that most of your abilities and combos are very, very lacklustre. This problem exacerbates itself as you gain levels and your abilities don't seem to change much (except of course the bigger damage numbers). It is frustrating to see enemy minions having cooler powers than your over levelled self. Many of the big spells you have turns you into a turret that can shoot in a linear line, and that ice beam you threw has a high chance of missing the enemy because the enemy was just a head above or below you. Yes...many of your spells cannot be aimed along the y axis. Oh..and your character cannot jump.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN/MAP:\nJust like its story and lore, the map of KOA:Reckoning is quite expansive with plenty of side quests and collectables spread all across. But the game play itself is so lacking that the map becomes a jogging simulator. There is absolutely nothing to do except go from one quest marker to another. Exploration results in no reward except for maybe some cool screen shots (there are quite a few cool looking locations). To its credit, there are a lot of different biomes in the game that look very different from each other. But they all play the same way. And remember my little comment on how you couldn't jump in this game? Yeah....that will come back to bite you in the ass multiple times. You see, this game doesn't let you fall off  the edge unless you are in a specific spot and press a button prompt, where your character will proceed to superhero land down to the lower level. So imagine the frutration when you need to go to a lower level but your character won't fall off the 3 foot drop unless you trek all the way towards the \"jump off point\". Did you imagine it? Good....now imagine you dropping off to the lower level but then realising you left a cool weapon on the upper level you jumped off from. There is no jump button so all the way around the \"cliff\" you go. It is hilarious to see your character, a spell slinging bad ass who gets bested by a knee high fence or a tree root.\n\nOVERALL:\nAlthough this game does have its moments, they are often lost in the long grind that will absolutely exhaust you. I can understand why there are quite a few fans of this game who sing praises for it, but in my humble opinion...this game isn't really worth your time and effort. Maybe pick it up when it is dirt cheap. Otherwise, don't bother.\n", "timestamp_created": 1682390871, "timestamp_updated": 1682390871, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516957461833953857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136419097": {"recommendationid": "136419097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014839364", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2268, "last_played": 1695819293}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game honestly.

Story? [/h1]\nBasic premise/Story\n\nAs a fan of RPG games. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning didn\u2019t come onto my radar until I had done extensive research on what it is. A huge open world, with multiple classes beyond three base classes. Dozens of sidequests, faction quests, and with a complete storyline. Lots of loot to discover and you can even rob NPCs as well. The game pretty much checks off everything I want in an open-world RPG game. And yet as the end credits roll I\u2019m left with a sense of dissatisfaction at the end. Although, I still retained an equal amount of satisfaction. There\u2019s a lot the game does well. But the game suffers from its ambitions as well. Let\u2019s break it down. \n\n[h1]A Reckoning of Issues [/h1]\nUnique Gameplay\n\nFirst, the story is decent. It's nothing earth-shattering. But as the main character the Fateless one. You go off into the world of the Firelands. Resurrected against your will and with no knowledge of your past life. Surely this would be a massive incentive to know who you are? Well no. The main character becomes embroiled in the world\u2019s affairs. Where the Tuatha Deohn is waging an all-out war on all the other mortal races. You become the unwilling(but willingly) recipient/punching bag/errand guy/gal to do the bidding of other individuals. Case in point. You gotta do other people favors before you can get your own sh** together and find out what happened to you. And most importantly why?\n\nAs you can see it's not a strong selling point to take the main character with amnesia neck deep into a large sprawling fantasy world who needs your services. Which can make you completely forget your background and wonder why the Tuatha Deohn is such a threat to all other inhabitants in the Faelands. Granted one could argue that there isn\u2019t a strong story because the world and its inhabitants serve as a conduit for the main character to live and partake in. And it is the world itself that is so fascinating\u2026 At least to an extent.\n\nThe world of the Faelands is ginormous and filled with enemies, fantasy creatures, dungeons, sidequests, living towns/cities with NPCs with routines, shops, and more. The game is packed full of content and is quite an impressive achievement from a studio I\u2019ve never heard about. Which can be compared to large worlds such as Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. However, this also serves as the game\u2019s weakest strength. The world can be filled to the brim. As long as it's with purpose. And I mean meaningful purpose. \n\nFor starters, the game has too many sidequests which can be in the category of killing \u2018x\u2019 enemy/s finding \u2018x\u2019 and bringing back \u2018y\u2019, etc. Some are more important than others and serve as an excellent way to enhance worldbuilding. But there are far too many and while it's easy to ignore and not do. It quickly becomes apparent some side quests such as Faction quests stand out a bit more than the average quests. \n\nMovement is a pain in the world. Since you can only run and fast travel to locations you\u2019ve been to. There is no mount available. So you have to run from one place to the next which can take some time and you can\u2019t take shortcuts since the main character cannot jump. Except in certain spots in the overworld. \n\nThe camera can also be kinda wonky when you\u2019re running where the field of view can switch abnormally from a far point of view to a somewhat respectable distance away from your main character. This is prevalent many times as I was running past enemies to get to my destination due to how large the overworld is. I do not need to face enemies and yet the camera thinks I want to fight. No lock-on feature as well. So you\u2019ll have to manually control the camera when fighting enemies. This becomes especially troublesome for many moments I want to dodge but inadvertently dodge in the wrong way due to the camera not being in sync with me. \n\nI did have a couple of instances where my character would lock up in place while I was not in combat and just running. Had to reload the game to fix it. But having the troublesome bug occur again later on. It is weird. \n\nThe enemy design needs more variety and uniqueness. Found them to be predictable and copy-paste too much for my liking. If I\u2019ve seen them in the overworld. I don\u2019t need to see them again in another part of the map. Or in a main quest or side quest again. When it's not suited for the enemy. To the point, I would guess what enemy awaited me in the dungeon and I could guess it right 9 times out of ten. Yikes. \n\nI don\u2019t like inventory limits. The game fills your inventory with miscellaneous items, weapons, armor, consumables, etc. Only had about 90 inventory spaces. But I was filled to the brim up to 79. And I\u2019ve already taken the liberty of cleaning out space full of non-essentials. Carrying only what I would use. And still, it\u2019s not enough to carry more. Especially for materials to upgrade/craft my own armor/weapon and more. The limitation is especially egregious since I\u2019m not a hoarder, and yet I was stoked at every turn of the game to clean my inventory. Granted there is a nifty feature to turn such items into junk and destroy it. But I'm going to have to use it every 5-10 min. Then I believe there is a problem with the inventory limit. \n\nAnd yet, all these issues aside. Did I at least have fun with the game? Well\u2026\n\n[h1] Amalur\u2019s Double-Edged Sword [/h1]\nFinal thoughts/Ruminations\n\nI did. Despite the issues, I stated above. The game is still fun to play because there is so much content to do. I dived super deep into the sidequests and faction quests forgetting about the main story quest entirely. It wasn\u2019t until I had accrued over 60 quests did I start to wonder. \u201cOh wait, I still have the main quests to do.\u201d I had fun making conversation with individuals and convincing them successfully with my persuasion skill or failing would lead to some interesting outcomes(usually fights). Helped the folks around who needed a helping hand like a goody-two-shoes. Decided to be for one day and started robbing shopkeepers' chests. And accidentally choosing more rude conversation responses than the opposite ones\u2026 Oops\u2026 \n\nRunning to new places can be a pain especially if they\u2019re far away. But at least there is fast travel to help me go back to previously known areas. Helps immensely for backtracking. \n\nTechnically issues didn\u2019t impact me in a major way throughout my playthrough. There were some moments when I was free of any bugs.\n\nThe enemy design variety could be improved to not reuse the same formula. But as long as you take breaks it is not a major pain in the butt. \n\nThe world is so dense helps in such a way you can easily get lost and since there are plenty of side quests you can easily do them to pass the time. \n\nInventory issue aside. If you don\u2019t loot everything you see then the limited inventory space isn\u2019t an issue. That is if you don\u2019t mind potentially missing out on something valuable because you didn\u2019t take the time to check it\u2026 Anyways\u2026\n\nSuffice it to say, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a mixed bag for me. But ultimately a good mixed bag. I enjoyed the incredibly huge world and lore surrounding it. Combat is pretty satisfying. The ability to change your classes into other professions makes the gameplay fresh and exciting. And changing classes was painless and easy. While I could do without the issues I've already mentioned above. The game still hits decently well for players who are looking for a big open-world RPG to sink their hours into. Just don\u2019t go into this looking for an epic story. the world and the inhabitants are the main stars of the game. \n\nTotal Times Beaten: 1\nScore: 7/10 \n", "timestamp_created": 1666681151, "timestamp_updated": 1666760757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124073963": {"recommendationid": "124073963", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977413811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 1562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1537, "last_played": 1693267660}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes.

It's not very difficult but the sheer size of a project like this is really impressive. I would've liked it to play less like a quest grinding rpg. Anything that wasn't a main story quest or a faction quest was just a kill or gather kind of quest. It is kind of a shame because it makes a lot of the zones less interesting than they appear visually, there just ends up not being new things to do in the new zones you go to.

KOA has a massive amount of Sidequests, that can be overwhelming. Positive on all the Quests is, that you get to know more about the situation in Amalur and how it impacts the people in it.\nAnother good point in this story is that as the protagonist, you realize and get to experience how you upset the balance of the world. Just because you shouldn't exist anymore.\n\nThe most negative point are for me, that the controls are a bit wacky until you get the hang of it and you can't really zoom in and out.\nA little bit of a con for me is the missing tracking of your achievement status.

Give me radically different settings here!  Not flat green hills, to rolling hills to moutains. I mean give me like Diablo 2 where you go from Transylvania woodlands to Egyptian sand dunes to the fires of Hell in just 3 levels.  Now thats diversity!!\n\nThis is a LONG game and it gets really boring fighting similar enemies with similar attacks over and over.  The quests get boring and repetitive.  The loot is all the same.  The only plus is that you can respec often to change up the gameplay.  I highly suggest you change class every 8 hours of playtime or so to keep it interesting or else you are going to get really bored doing the same attacks over and over. \n\nThe lack of bosses is also a huge negative.  They could have easily thrown in a bunch of big boss encounters to spice up the gameplay and make it less boring.  Yes there are a few bosses here and there, but not nearly enough and the memorable ones are few and far between.   No a reskinned mob with double HP doesnt count as a boss, I'm talking scripted unique content here. \n\nAnyways if you really wnat to try this game get the improved edition, and try to change class often.

I've actually spent more hours on that than this version (didn't buy on Steam) and had a blast just like in the original. However, if you own this version, save your money and pass up re-reckoning. Everything you need is already here. If you didn't buy any of the dlc before they were removed from the store, you're not missing out on much. I'd say only The Legend of Dead Kel was worth playing, but only if you like the idea of owning an island.\nThe new Fatesworn dlc they hyped up as the main selling point of re-reckoning is also nothing but terrible fetch quests, and it's chaos system only serves to interrupt combat. I'd say the only positive is that it's a nice looking location, adds 2 new backpacks, and extends the level cap from 40 to 50, though this is all overkill really. Unfortunately the fetch questing became so absurd that I just abandoned Fatesworn entirely. I didn't want to find 5 armor pieces, each locked behind a chaos portal dungeon, which were each locked behind their own large dungeons.", "timestamp_created": 1652698638, "timestamp_updated": 1652698638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489250123500823975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115282389": {"recommendationid": "115282389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022044694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1837, "last_played": 1674615415}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: Play time is inaccurate due to majority of it being offline play, time is closer to 50-60 hours.\nTLDR: worth a try, especially on sale\ncombat is decent but will feel dated compared to modern game play.\ngame is buggy with no patches even with the remastered version e.g not being able to get rid of old quest items locked doors with no key, getting stuck on things etc.\nstory is interesting enough, but not something to remember.\nmy main gripe with the game play is the feeling of repetitiveness.

Playing it now with all of the DLC is still amazing. The only changes in the new version are improvements on the graphics, a new harder difficulty setting, a new separate DLC (which a lot of people seem to hate, just check it's reviews) and how tough enemies spawn in when entering an area (which is the biggest difference of all of these, so I will elaborate on that further) but if none of that is a deal breaker to you, just buy this version unless you can somehow get the newer one for the same price or cheaper.\n\n[spoiler]\nTo further describe how the new version changes enemy spawns, first you have to learn that all areas have a level range. The level range is the range of possible levels used by the game to determine the difficulty of enemies in a given area. The level of your enemies also determines how much experience you earn when you beat them. The range of levels varies between areas (and can vary based on your difficulty settings, if I recall correctly).\nWhen you enter an area for the first time, your character's level at that moment is saved into that area in your save file permanently for that character. If your current level is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum, then the game instead will save the minimum or maximum level respectively. Afterwards, any time you come back to that area, no matter what level you are, it will still spawn in enemies at whatever level is saved to your file for that area.\nThis means if you run around aimlessly at the start of the game, or are simply excited to explore the big open world, you could easily end up permanently locking large chunks of the game to their minimum levels and end up having to grind for experience points in the early sections, which can be rather tedious. Additionally this can cause some difficulty spikes in the early game if you ran through a few areas of the game early, did most of the quests and dungeons in those areas, and then went on to a new area.\nAs an example, if you went to every area in the first section of the game (Dalentarth), you could easily end up fighting off level 3 enemies for the entirety of the first 8 areas of the game and then, when you decide to move on to a new location roughly 6-16 hours later after you've done all of the quests in those areas, you could then suddenly be facing level 13 enemies.\nThis has caused some players to feel like they are forced to do all quests and dungeons in an area before moving on to the next and to be overly careful not to go into new areas, for fear of the above situation. That said though, the game is not very grind-y, experience points do come fairly easily, and even if the difficulty does spike in such a situation, it is technically spiking up to your current level and shouldn't be anything you can't handle since the game is fairly balanced.\nIn the new version, whenever you enter an area, the game doesn't save your level to it. It just makes enemy calculations based on your level in the level range whenever you entered the area. If you stay and level up, it will still be based on the level you entered; However, If you leave and come back, It will then take your new current level for calculations instead. This way an area will never be too easy or too hard unless you are above or below the area's level range.\n[/spoiler]\n\nTL;DR, In this version, each area will save the level you first entered it at. That level will forever be used to determine the difficulty of enemies in that area. If you explore too much too early, this can cause some problems for the early game, but they are negligible because of the game's balance. In the new version, the game simply recalculates enemy difficulty every time you enter an area, effectively removing any of these possible problems.\n\nThis genuinely changes gameplay as now you can freely move between more areas doing whatever quests in them in whatever order without the fear of making things too easy or, worse, making some players feel like you have to do every little thing in one area when you first reach it or else when you come back, it will give you little to no XP.\n\nThe graphics may be higher resolution, but the game has a very distinct style of its' own that many feel isn't that impacted by resolution changes (I played this on a 50 inch TV on PS3 in 2012 and a 60 inch TV now. It still holds up). The harder difficulty will not change the way you play, at least not that much from playing on just hard mode. And as I said before, the new DLC is not well liked by many in the community.", "timestamp_created": 1642837791, "timestamp_updated": 1642838143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488631397485733032", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108467131": {"recommendationid": "108467131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080805570", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3352, "last_played": 1643654143}, "language": "english", "review": "fun and interesting game play", "timestamp_created": 1642779006, "timestamp_updated": 1642779006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108415530": {"recommendationid": "108415530", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989090584", "num_games_owned": 1387, "num_reviews": 204, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 454, "last_played": 1584052254}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10", "timestamp_created": 1642716110, "timestamp_updated": 1642716110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108285595": {"recommendationid": "108285595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043050870", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1114, "last_played": 1659979178}, "language": "english", "review": "Its nice.", "timestamp_created": 1642535484, "timestamp_updated": 1642535484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108243941": {"recommendationid": "108243941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058897539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5181, "last_played": 1642498090}, "language": "english", "review": "strange fight scenes", "timestamp_created": 1642474398, "timestamp_updated": 1642474398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4946727454662323", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108093673": {"recommendationid": "108093673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251279082", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 3855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1641, "last_played": 1645564437}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an okay game.

Prompted by the release of the remaster \"Rereckoning\", I started playing in January. I have beaten 5 other games on the side while trying to make my way to the end of this game. It isn't even the longest single playthrough I've clocked in a game, with Skyrim somehow coming out to 90 hours and KoA clocking in at 75, but it somehow felt so much longer than it really was. At the end of this epic journey, I am a little torn. The game is so close to greatness in its genre mash-up open world style, but still so frustratingly far away.\n\nThe Tuatha are at war with the people of Amalur. A sect of a race of immortals known as Fae, the Tuatha have been leading a crusade against mortal-kind and others of their kind, lead by a Fae known as Gadflow. The mortal races have held their own for decades, but while the mortals losses are irreplaceable, the Tuatha simply resurrect their forces and begin the war anew. In a desperate attempt to reverse the inevitable tide of the war, a gnome works to replicate Fae immortality but is met with only failure until you defy fate and rise from the dead.\n\nKoA could best be described as a sort of weird fusion between World of Warcraft (Art Style), Skyrim (Persistent Open World, numerous skill systems), Darksiders (Combat), and an ARPG like Torchlight (Paperdoll Loot System, all quests available for all builds). On the whole these different elements fuse together quite nicely and make KoA really feel like its own thing.\n\nThe game also has an excellent classless (or more like Class-Fluid) RPG system that deftly balances its three Warrior/Mage/Rogue archetypes to allow players to go all in on one class, create hybrid classes or even go full universalist (my personal favorite). Depending on the number of points you have in any of the three skill trees, you unlock \"fates\" which are basically class specializations that provide bonuses depending on your point distribution among the three trees. For example, put points into Warrior and Mage and unlock the \"Battlemage\" specialization, put points across the Warrior/Mage/Rogue trees equally and unlock the \"Polymath\" fate. So on and so on.\n\nThis makes for extremely entertaining arcade/actiony gameplay that is fast and fun and really lets you spec out your character as you see fit. Light armor and daggers for sneak attacks, supplemented by berserker rage when things go south? Sure. Want to do a sword and board paladin that does the parry/strike thing with healing potential? Sure. You want to go all out mage and have access to the beefiest spells in the game? Sure.\n\nOf course, to supplement this system are your standard assortment of skills: smithing, Gem crafting, Alchemy, stealth, etc...\n\nThe downside of such a broad system is, as you might have guessed, the game is absurdly easy as it wants to encourage diverse builds and as such never really puts anything in your way that makes any permutation of your build non-viable. Enemies die quick, no quests are gated behind skills or ability or speech checks, and if you ever go down the blacksmith and crafting paths, you're character will quickly outgrow enemies even several levels above you.\n\nThe game also lacks some of Skyrim's emergent gameplay. Yes, there are a lot of game systems at work, people have wake/sleep cycles, etc, but its all superficial, none of these systems interact with each other to create weird/novel occurrences that add to the charm of the game. There is no \"use poison on apple, wait till victim eats it an dies\" sort of stuff here.\n\nLastly, the game starts out fast with a host of options and paths to take your PC down but then bogs down significantly in the middle portion of the game as you're reasonably invested in a build and the game sort of runs out of new things to show you and the gameplay loop starts to get stale. The back end of the game gets interesting on account of the story really picking up pace, two fun boss fights to really shake things up, and way more interactions with the antagonist and more \"grey\" factions. Its unfortunate that by that point most players will be 40-50 hours into the game and ready to just beeline it to the ending.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I did enjoy my time with Kingdoms of Amalur. The game is easy on the eyes, fun and fast paced, has excellent production values in its narrative, story, and the voice acting is superb. Its just too much. I would have much four 20 hour playthroughs, than one monster 80 hour playthrough and maybe some day developers will cater to an audience like me.\n\nGiven the remaster was launched and the property was purchased by THQ, i hope there is some sort of sequel in the planning stages out there. With some refinement, KoA can have it all.

And combat takes up 90% of the game...so...that's a lot.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to say, this is the first game that I've seen that actually encourages spending skill points in the three skill trees (might, finesse, sorcery). As such the customization is rather extensive. That goes for creating the look of your character as well.\n\nThere are plenty of weapon types and armor/accessories that can help you further customize to create a play style that works for you.\n\nI didn't follow the storyline, because it's one of those that presents you with a lot of text or you can sit around and wait for the voice acting to finish up. Then you are presented with multiple responses and the talking can go on and on. This is typical in longer rpg's, and I never pay attention for I find it boring.\n\nNow anyway, back to the combat. As I said, I played as a warrior type and swung around a big heavy hammer. This made the game feel Souls-Like, but at the same time the gameplay was hack'n'slash/dungeon crawler as well. And it did not mix well.\n\nIn order to not get hit, the game would prefer you to do one attack, dodge, and repeat this as many times as needed. But each hit in a combo does substantially more damage than the last, so you want to get those big hits, so risking getting hit was worth it to me. Plus it's boring the other way. This is okay for fighting a couple of enemies, but when you get to the big groups, combat can be a nightmare.\n\nAt times, the enemies can get into a rhythm that one attacks, followed by another, followed by another, so on and so forth. If you get hit, it takes 1-3 seconds to recover, so you'll get stuck like that, which is incredibly annoying.\n\nSpeaking of annoying, just about every enemy in the game can be described as such. Especially flying enemies. These buggers always float away from you, and it can be a real chore to get close enough to them to hit them with my giant hammer.\n\nBut none compare to the mages (they fly too). One by themselves is okay, but when there are three or more, you're in for a nightmarish fight. They have shields that block your skill to pull them close to you all Scorpion style, and bombard you with tornadoes and fireballs. You're too busy getting hit or shielding or dodging to ever move closer to one of them, and when you finally reach one, they teleport away. This makes me...frown.\n\nWhen they want to ramp up the difficulty with \"tougher\" enemies, they just make them have really high armor so that your attacks do about 1/4 what they normally do. Full disclosure, this does not add to the difficulty, all it does is add to the time I have to spend playing this game, which in turn adds to my anger and annoyance.\n\nYou do get a variety of skills depending on how you spend your skill points. These can help you out in combat. For instance, the warrior gets a battle cry skill, that when fully upgraded can knock people down. \"Oh cool!\" I say, excited for the prospects this could have in battle. But woe is me, for the animation is so long for the move, that any enemies who got knocked over are back up before you can move again. So this tells me that fully upgrading this skill rewards you with guaranteeing you won't get hit while using it and nothing else. Thanks devs. That's mighty generous of you!\n\nAnother such skill is upgrading to potentially stun someone and doing more damage to said stunned folk.\nOn the extremely rare occasion something does get stunned, they are only stunned until you hit them, so whoopdeedoo, I get to do more damage for one whole attack! Those are points well spent, I tell you!\n\nAnother useless thing coming at you- almost every weapon has some type of elemental damage included. So  if my hammer does poison or fire damage, it just adds to the hurting on some enemies over time. Except it does 1-2 damage per second for like 10 seconds.

The janky camera that sometimes freaks out in tight places and always, always swings too fast to center behind me. The sluggish combat controls that make blocking difficult when you've just finished an attack. The closeness of the camera to the character that makes it difficult to judge distance sometimes. The inventory screen, which is boring and tedious to navigate. The list goes on...\n\nBut for some reason, I'm enjoying it, anyway. Maybe I'm more patient now that I'm 10 years older. Who knows.

The setting is a pretty standard high fantasy fair, complete with different races, a medieval vibe and the usual type of monsters that you would expect to see. There's a lot of interesting designs and whatnot that are present here that give the game a fresh flavour within the parameters of a pretty standard high fantasy setting, such as the elf like Alfar, the trollish Bolgans, etc. Essentially there is fresh coat of paint over the standard dungeons and dragons type stuff you'd expect, where the archetypes are there but presented differently to fit within the game's lore, and the designs are superb (the art direction in general is awesome) \n\nThe lore is really what makes this game shine, in my opinion. This is a world that is very very fleshed out, with lots of books and stuff to read, a rich history, towns and cities and fortresses with their own flavours, different climate zones and so on. They really did a great job in making the world feel believable and lived in, and if you are into that sort of exploring and getting immersed in the world, then I think you will get a kick out of this.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the art direction is really really nice. The graphics hold up today, despite some low res textures and stuff, but the actual designs of the characters, towns, wildlife, weapons, etc is really great. It is a somewhat cartoony style, so if you aren't into that then you might not like it, but if you are I suspect you'll find it to be quite charming. The game is also very colourful, there's always something beautiful to look at, whether that be lush grasslands, ancients forests, castles, etc. The unity of vision in the design really comes together in the finished product. \n\nThe gameplay itself is not bad, it's super responsive and smooth so playing it does feel good. Unfortunately, it's pretty damn easy, even on hard mode and by the end, you'll be pretty well steamrolling everybody. Furthermore, the structure of how the story progresses is the same throughout. Basically you get to a hub in a new region which might be a town or an outpost of some sort, where you can buy and sell goods and get side quests. Once you do all these and proceed to the main objective its on to the next area. Because of this, \n and the ease of the combat, I think the game sort of outstays it's welcome a bit. Although once you get to Klurikon, your progress will definitely speed up a bit.\n\nSpeaking of which, the final bit of the game seems unfinished. The final zone, Alabastra, is the only area of the game where there isn't much side quests to do. You pretty much rush through to the ending, save for a few quests here and there. There's also a few different caves and castles to go in, but there isn't much reason to explore them since there's no quest to complete and you'll have long since found your best gear by then. So to me, it seems like they sort of ran out of time/money at this point because it feels a bit empty (case in point the missing scout on the ridge... play it and you'll know what I mean). I also ran into some strange glitches around this point as well.\n\nThe ending was a bit abrupt but I think was fairly satisfying, it doesn't drag on with a long ending cinematic, but some people might find it a bit rushed. One final gripe I had is killing the final boss. You need to deal a deathblow to it, but they don't really telegraph where you need to stand in order for it to work, so it was pretty frustrating.\n\nAll in all, if you like high fantasy, want a game with decent RPG mechanics and a lush and interesting world to explore, I think it's worth checking out. It's not the best gameplay wise, and the story isn't exactly going to win any awards for originality, but it's definitely a decent game with a ton of character.", "timestamp_created": 1631916939, "timestamp_updated": 1631916939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99512815": {"recommendationid": "99512815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126957440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 201, "playtime_forever": 6252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6252, "last_played": 1579758839}, "language": "english", "review": "The day of reckoning has not come yet", "timestamp_created": 1631900425, "timestamp_updated": 1631900425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99489269": {"recommendationid": "99489269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060031560", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1482845505}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best RPG games I have ever played.

The locations definitely look nice the first time you see them, but across the roughly 40 hour journey you're going to see it over and over.\n\nI wasn't too invested in the lore and the story; it's just not that memorable with all these lore dumps. I feel like a month from now I'm not going to remember anything about the story or the main characters.\n\nThe combat in this game is alright, but it just takes up such a large portion of the game. You can rarely walk half a minute in any direction before being accosted and fighting for three minutes. I just \nwant there to be a fair balance between combat and exploration, and it feels pretty uneven.\n\nThe part I enjoy the least about this game is the loot and level balancing. As you visit new areas, enemies will match your level, so even if you're leveling it doesn't feel like you're getting stronger.

I really did. I first played the game in 2015 after it had been sitting in my backlog. When I went to play the game for the \"first time\" in 2021, I had completely forgotten my 15+ hours already clocked in on the game. I wondered why that was until I had gotten far enough into my 2nd run to realize why. The game feels empty.\n\nThe world map is structured exactly like an MMO except that you are by yourself and the little quirks from having tons of other people running around the same world is absent....because it's only you. Every quest is a fetch quest or a \"go here and kill this\" type of MMO quest. There is no quest variety whatsoever and although the game has hundreds of these quests, they barely give any XP, forcing you to primarily have to grind kills to rank up. The combat is good, but with how fast most enemies attack, slower weapons like greatswords and hammers aren't as good because you can easily get stunlocked by even low level mobs.\n\nThey clearly put a lot of effort into the world building and dialogue, which is great. The only problem is when you pair it with simplistic combat and constant fetch quests, it all kind of falls flat. After a while I just had a strong urge to skip all dialogue, which is when I realized I was done playing the game. Which is a shame, because you can tell they poured tons of effort into the game and even had top name fantasy and video game writers and developers working on it.\n\nMost people won't see this as this review is for the delisted version of the game. However if you have this game in your backlog or are thinking of buying the remastered version and stumbled across this page, let me warn you. This game is fun for the first few hours, but if you want a deep and engaging RPG look somewhere else.

The quests are like a straight arrow, just pay attention to the dialog. \n\n[b]Advice[/b]: Play the game on hard difficulty.\nAfter the tutorial, I thought that the game seems balanced. Fast forward 10-13 levels into the game, the difficulty went from normal to easy and at the end of the game I 3 hit the last 4 bosses. (played 39str/40intel/41agi)\n\nOther:\n\nBest thing about this game is the fighting mechanics, where you can do all kinds of stuff and also the environment that looks good, big, making you feel that you are walking into a dungeon/cave/castle/fortress.\nMain story doesn't seem that impact-full. It provides you a random reason for your death. (i haven't read all the books in the game). \nReading books/notes, didn't help at all. Quit reading lore books/notes after 9 hours into the game. \nSame mobs, over and over and over. Except for the last 6/9(only story mode) or 20/25 hours (if you like to loot everything and do every last quest)\nUnskippable cut scenes when monster suddenly appear. (fun at first, when presenting the monster. annoying afterwards)\nRandom bugs: got stuck between 2 chairs after talking with npc. game froze 2-3 times. unreachable loot. pixel perfect jumps/quest item loot able. quest followers resetting their place and had to backtrack.\nYou cannot play as a rogue.\n\n\n[h1]Guide[/h1]  \nAt the start of your journey, you will struggle for money. Sell anything you can and do not rob, because traveler's vendors will receive your stolen/pick pocketed goods. (Invest in Mercantile Stat) \nSome items cannot be sold and will occupy your inventory.\nGet your first house fast, in order for additional 155 storage space.\nWhen creating your own character, Race/benefits are not important.\n\n1) \nBest Money repeatable quests:\nPeasants clothes will be asked in a quest at the Moon Camp, under Rathir) - best value since, requires at least lvl 10+ to get at the camp.\nIron or steel components from salvaged equipment will be asked in a quest at the Sun Camp) - second best value, requires lvl 15+ to get at the camp.\n\n2)\nStats\n-Alchemy \nDo not max it out first. materials will drop randomly either from gathering/killing/chests (never used potions on normal mode after lvl 18+) \n\n-Blacksmith \nGood for most of the time. Quick save before you salvage items, to get the best outcome if you want to be top tier. Crafting gets better and better (used it 3 times in the playthough) \nRepair kit is useful anytime, anywhere and cheap. \nTip: keep the best salvaged items for end game weapon and armor\n\n-Dispelling\nUseless to max it out. 5 lvls into it and it's enough.  tip: clear 2 entire zones, then go dispelling. after getting 1 curse, go dispel it at healer. You will receive a buff that will protect you from future curses. \n\n-Detect Hidden  \nGood stat, letting you see hidden doors/stashes; last lvl showing you Lorestones and Treasure chests. ( It DOESN'T SHOW every loot able thing. Example skeletons do not appear on the map. )\n\n-Lockpick \nUseless at the start of the game. (Most of the Set Items are randomly dropped by chests. You cannot Salvage the Set Items(Yellow) or Purple Items.)\n\n-Persuasion \nUseless (You have 0 impact on the actual story. It can help avoid some fights or to investigate stuff.)\n\n-Sagecrafting \nUseless. (IF you want the best gear possible, it's useful at the end game for crafting 7 gems.)\n\n-Stealth\nUseless. (It's only helpful if you steal/lockpick/pickpocket. You cannot play as a rogue. \n\nInfo: \nStat Books provide you with +1 Stat. Stat books are randomly dropped. (I got 6/7 Stat books)\nThere are trainers for every Stat at different levels with different amounts of pay. The last trainers are only available in the last zone, after completing most of the story quest.\nTip: After getting access to visit the King in Ysa, you should be at lvl 15+ with 500 000 gold. Now go and search for every trainer and respec if you need to. (DO NOT BE CHEAP. I finished the game with 5Million gold) \n\n3)\nRespec:\nFateweavers can help you respec. \nFirst respect is free, second respec at lvl 18 it cost me around 5k gold. At lvl 36 at my 6-7th respec I payed around 50k gold. \n\n4) \nDestinies\nPlay what you want, there are pros and cons to every destiny you choose.\nNote: You cannot play as a proper Assassin. There are more benefits in being an Archer than a Rogue/Assassin.\n\n5)\nWeapons do not matter but I placed it anyways\n\nA+ Faeblades are the best because you have lorestone buffs/card buffs that provide dmg when using a Faeblades.\nA   Daggers/Longswords are second to best since, you have abilities in strength and agility that boosts the dmg of faeblades,daggers and longswords\nB   Bow/Scepters because they are ranged and you have auto aim \nC   Chakrams good damage and speed. it takes a bit of practice to get their full potential.\nD   Greatsword/Hammer they have the highest damage in the game, but the're slow\n\nNote: I've only ranked them from the POV of buffs/card buffs/abilities.

The review is for Reckoning (the older game).\n\nAs an RPG, it fulfills its role. You can have a sorcerer (pure magic), a warrior (pure might) or a rogue (pure finesse).  You can also be a jack of all trades (mix and match). I play pure magic (sorcerer) and expect that my review will have limitations based on this.\n\nThe game is your typical go-do this; fetch that item RPG. Many quests involve going into a dungeon/cave. Sadly, most of them have similar layouts. The story is not the best, nor is it the worst. Someone brings you back from the dead, and you have amnesia. Along your way to discover your roots, you will help people and certain factions. You can aid all factions without getting punished for it, even if they have opposite values. There is a war in Amalur that affects everyone, yourself included. This war is the main story\u2014A+ for having a main plot and subplots, devs.  \n\nThe graphics are older. If you have a larger monitor, you will need to see what resolution works for you. It's not horrible because you're not going into this expecting out-of-this-world graphics. You can roam anywhere in the main world, which is a plus and a detriment. Below, I will tell you about things that you likely want to do first and why there are sequential issues (the story does not always bring you where it would be best for your character). Not being in the best zone/area for your level/character/questing would be fine, as I read that the zones no longer stayed at the same level that you were when you first entered them.  I have found that to be untrue with Detyre. I'm one-shotting everything, and the loot is horrible.  \n\nSpeaking of the loot, kudos on the devs for coming out with crafting and with higher-tiered gear that you can get in the wild/while questing.  The issue is that the top-tier armour (yellow) has a set of 5-6, depending on your character.  I have only ever found one full set, and my helmet was level 8 while my shoes were level 22. The more of the same type of armour you equip, the more bonuses you can get from these yellow pieces. Armour and weapons do not level with you. If you love a yellow set, do not loot any pieces until the desired level (40 is the max level). You may have to bypass areas of an earlier zone and move on to another location. To me, this is a big issue. I've only ever used this yellow armour to sell it because I never had a set that was beneficial enough to keep. Yellow armour feels mostly irrelevant other than to make some gold. If you are crafting your armour, you can make some of the best armour in the game. You will need to salvage some of the armour and weapons you looted to get components to make your armour and weapons.  Some are crappy components, while others are better. A proper balance of sold armour and salvaged armour will be required to craft while having enough money to survive. The game is fun, but there are many issues regarding the flow/progression.\n\nLet me tell you about some annoying bugs that I encountered to help you avoid repeating my hair-pulling ''mistakes''.  1) There are pieces of armour and weapon that stay stuck in your inventory.  You cannot salvage them.  You cannot destroy them.  You cannot sell them. The house of Ballads (yellow set) is one of these.  If you put it in storage and then take it out of storage, it will stay in your inventory forever (taking inventory space).  Wear it if you like it and sell it once done with it.  If you're a magic-user, wear it for the minute you're forced to put it on, and then sell it as soon as you get out of your ''dungeon''. DO NOT PUT IT IN STORAGE.  Your storage has limited space. I wanted to clean up my storage space, and BAM, it's now stuck in my inventory. 2) The weapon Shrine and Shadow (purple tier or second-best tier) stays stuck in your inventory as well.  I forget how I got this one stuck in my inventory. I suggest Googling it when you find this weapon.  I think that I had put it into my storage and took it out to sell it. 2) There are some chests that you won't be able to loot.  This bug seems rare, but there is one chest in Detyre described as a ''larder''.  It's in one of the Motus mining camps (in the basement). 3) I spoke about this above, but I would Google the best progression route to take.  Most caves (dungeons) can be entered without reason to do so, but some quests may become bugged if you do.  Wait until you have a quest to enter the cave/dungeon.  I think that one or two dungeons do not have any quests related to them. 4) Save often and have different saves.  Having a main save before entering a main mission is likely a good idea.  It's not so much that the areas bug out.  It's that you can steal from people, and the devs messed this up by allowing you to steal items that you will need to steal for quests (without having the quest) or to loot items that you will need to loot for quests later on.  This bug renders some quests unavailable/unfinishable.  Your save can be a lifesaver if you cannot find any workaround.  I would read the bug page on the Amalur wiki page.  I found a buried body that I could loot.  I did what one does in an RPG and looted it. I had also stolen rings from people, even if I didn't know what their use was.  Then came the quest of ''find this body which will give you clues as to where these rings are...I want these rings''.  Oh great...the body becomes untargettable. Thankfully, I found a workaround (of my own as no online fixes/suggestions worked).  If you're a completionist, this game will make you scared to loot!\n\nMy advice: \nYour first house is in Canneroc (in Webwood).  You have access to your first ''stash'' in that house.  Since your inventory is minimal at first, I highly suggest going there as soon as you can and doing the mission that gives you this house as a reward.\n\nEach time you level, you get to put points into your character's skills (might, finesse, sorcery).  You also get to put points into things such as alchemy, blacksmithing....  Put all your points in ''find hidden'' first. This skill will show you hidden items and hidden doors.  These items are extra money, and money does not come easily at first. Then, max out blacksmithing and sagecrafting.  These are the two skills that you will need to make your armour and make it as good as possible.  After that, you can put points into anything else.  Alchemy can be useful if you want to make your potions instead of buying them.  Without points spent in alchemy, you can try to loot any plant, but most will yield no result/you couldn't collect anything. The only plants that you can loot with a high success rate (without alchemy points) are those that allow you to make the minor healing potion.\n\nLastly, the smith of a town can repair your broken armour.  They charge a fortune, even from the start.  If you put points into blacksmithing, you can get better results from the repair kits you can buy and use to fix your armour.  They are 60g each compared to the 1300g a smith may ask to repair one item.  The item repair system is not balanced correctly.  60x6 to fix all of your armour or 16 000 from a smith?  It makes a huge difference.  You can store those repair kits in your stash.  They stack up to 10, and each stack of 10 takes one spot (in your inventory or stash).  I keep one stack of 10 on me at all times.", "timestamp_created": 1615062759, "timestamp_updated": 1615062759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608092308044433594", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87974027": {"recommendationid": "87974027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044975832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 567, "last_played": 1637180275}, "language": "english", "review": "I freaking love this game.

Hooray! My childhood's wet introvert dream!\n\n[h1]Long:[/h1] As mentioned above, this game is incredibly much like an MMORPG, but without the MMO-part: The world is vibrant, colorful, and a comic-book level of uniquely designed which is reminiscent of classic oldschool RPGs like WoW, Fable or Morrowind. The quests are so detached from one another and have such little impact on the main storyline that they feel much like from an online game - they're fun to play and some have quite interesting storylines, but the wild assortiment and generic dungeon crawling mechanics of them are just too reminiscent of 2000's MMORPGs with the same feeling. (If you enjoyed those, you will be pleased with KoA's gameplay too!) \n[b]Speaking of quests[/b], the side quests are... bountiful, to say the least. I did the grave mistake of trying to complete every single side quest before the main quest, which soon turned out to be a horrendous time eater as there are TONS of quests. Do them at your own pace, you will CERTAINLY not run out.\n\n[b]The game's writing[/b] was done by an accomplished fantasy author, which really shows by the sheer amount of lore and names that are being dropped and the interesting plot development. (Minor spoiler:  [spoiler]The ending was too quick, sudden and super anticlimatic, but the buildup was quite nice - most notably the siege with General Tilara.[/spoiler]) The world of KoA doesn't quite have the race diversity that other franchises have (everyone is basically a glorified human or some sort of elf), but it fits neatly into the world building and the most important elven race is touched upon quite in detail, so it seems purposeful.\n\n[b]The gameplay[/b] sports three different combat styles - Might (Warrior), Finesse (Thief), Magic - which are very distinctively different from one another, have own combo chains and are highly entertaining to explore. Overall, I found that the combat was greatly more enjoyable than in most mainstream RPGs. You even get to try out all three skill trees within one playthrough as this game allows for full redistribution of skill points at any time! (As long as you visit the right NPC.) The combat system deserves a lot of praise imo for being innovative while still being easily accessible to everyone. It's very easy to learn, especially mix-and-matching Finesse skills with either Magic or Might is very fun and makes for some fast-paced, intense combat.\n\n[b]Also, I love crafting.[/b] I am one of those people. And KoA: Reckoning has a good, not mind-blowing but thoroughly good crafting system, most notably the armor/weapon blacksmithing. It might be the most important skill set in the game! Self-made armor and weapons are by far the strongest and can even be named to bear majestic customized titles such as \"tiddy plate\". Because of the power of self-made equipment crafting is super satisfying and yes, I got a ton of enjoyment out of it.\n\nNow, an important aspect of this game is the amount of [b]dungeon crawling[/b] - which I have honestly never been the biggest fan of, so this is also KoA's biggest shortcoming imo. Basically every single quest in this game requires you to enter a generic-looking dungeon at some point, and the amount of backtracing can be frustrating. Transportation takes a while as the maps are vast and you have no means of traveling besides on foot or per fast travel (which, naturally, does not work in dungeons). I could have done with better-placed shortcuts and dungeon exits or the existence of at least one mount, to be honest. I sorely missed these aspects as the maps sometimes seemed excessively vast. (The amount of walking time is not in a good ratio with the amount of cities/key places.)\n\n[b]All in all,[/b] KoA: Reckoning masters all the core gameplay mechanics in fantasy RPG that will satisfy and keep you entertained if you like fantasy RPGs even just a little, and it is a wonderful game in total. It's not another run-off-the-mill, bleak and dark high fantasy clone of Lord Of The Rings (aherm, Skyrim, aherm) but instead  charms with an explosively colorful, unique world design that is reminiscent of the three classics mentioned above: Fable and Darksiders in terms of gameplay and \"tone\", WoW in terms of quests and art style. It really brought me back to the RPG era of the mid-2000's and early 2010's, but in the best way. While it has its little faults in terms of story wrapping and dungeon crawling, you can still feel what an ambitious project it was at its time of development. It held up amazingly well. Don't bother going out of your way to get KoA: Re-Reckoning if you already own this base game; it is fantastic as is and needs more love.", "timestamp_created": 1614003374, "timestamp_updated": 1614004043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87204248": {"recommendationid": "87204248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079122808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1652944861}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the kind of RPG I loved from the golden age of action RPG's.

The baseball pitcher Curt Shilling, who owned Studio 38(developers of this game) put all his money into it, 33 million dollars. But it was the time, skyrim was released so this jewel did not get the attention, it deserved and studio 38 went bancrupt, it was sold 1,5 million times but needed 3 million sells to just cover its costs.\nIts a jewel, if you like rpg-action with lots of lore and a great atmosphere, this is for you. A dev said, with all sidequests you need 200 hours to play, that huge it is. A gossip from the community stated after 80 hours its over. I needed around 110 hours, doing all sidequests but often (shame on me) clicked away the dialogues, because i'm not that much into lore in games(oh yes mylord, shame on me).\nFighting is really fun, you can customize your char nearly as you like. The graphics is close to wow graphics, if you don't like that, its a disadvantage..but the game has such a unique style and character, i forgot pretty quick about its graphical style.\nIt is not in 1st view, instead you see your character big in front of you, which is annoying for the most people, but a little tool named \"widescreen fixer\" helps with that, do yourself a favor and install it right away.\n1 or 2 situations can happen, that you enter a cave and game crashes, i just closed widescreen fixer and all was well again.\nSo a big recommendation from me, i actually finished it and i'm a bit sad because all is over now, and this happens really rarely to me, so have fun !\n", "timestamp_created": 1612521626, "timestamp_updated": 1612521626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85944754": {"recommendationid": "85944754", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971098718", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 328, "playtime_forever": 3647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3647, "last_played": 1698234921}, "language": "english", "review": "KoA - Is a Underrated but Amazing game 8.5/10\n\n+ Gameplay\n+ Nice visuals\n+ Lore\n\nWorth It!", "timestamp_created": 1612447774, "timestamp_updated": 1612447774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85841805": {"recommendationid": "85841805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227739300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1549, "last_played": 1634410193}, "language": "english", "review": "the game is very fun, cant stop playing\n", "timestamp_created": 1612296094, "timestamp_updated": 1612296094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85809211": {"recommendationid": "85809211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030920337", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1612257611}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is boring and bland.

Enemy AI and moveset were very basic and combat felt very boring.

At the time, it had some innovative features and seemed fairly unique. \n\nLet me start off by saying this game is HUGE. It has a WoW vibe to the aesthetic, and the environments are very nice to look at and explore. Combat is simple, you can use abilities that you unlock over time, and you can unlock a few combos for every type of weapon in the game, which provides some diversity. It's not the most intricate combat system, but it does the job well enough. On another note, it is VERY easy to get lost in all the side quests. There are hundreds! It was the main reason why I stopped playing this game (started to get a bit mundane) and play other games in my library. \n\nAfter a couple years I got back into the game to finish it. You can respec your characters as many times as you want, which is nice, because I had no idea what build I was going for. Don't attempt to clear every single quest. It will drive you mad. Stick to the main and faction quests, and get side quests that are along your way, otherwise you may find youself over-levelled later on. \n\nAt the time of writing this, I hear they are re-releasing this game. Seems like its just a graphical update. If you've never played this and want a simple RPG thats not too complicated, I recommend this. Will it hold up to modern classics (Witcher 3, etc.)?

To me, the 'Re-Reckoning' version isn't really worth the money if you already have the original, but it might be a nice time if you're new to the game.  All-in-all, this is a pretty cool game to get your hands on.  One of the things I loved was the Fate cards and how you can mix-n-match for a unique background, instead of being forced into one particular path, even though your play-style includes other abilities (a Warrior's skill with a sword, coupled with a Thief's stealth and a Wizard's defense magic, etc.)\n\nThere are some downsides, of course, like going on tiresome side-quests and the usual grinding, but overall it's a really fun game.

The quests in this game are very generic and almost follow the identical path. example, \"step 1: Go here to this location and meet Person.  Step 2: Person tells you to go to another location across the map to meet this Person. Step 3: meet that person, they tell you to go here to help them clear out an area of enemies and come back. Step 4: Clear out enemies/help with problem, come back to person. they are shocked you aren't affected by the Fates and tell you to go to see this new person.\" Rinse Repeat. \n\nThe quest that made me quit the game literally had me running across a huge map to touch \"windstones\" there were FOUR of them total and each on one on a corner of the HUGE map and the only way to get to them was to run across the DAMN map.  took me about 10 minutes of running and fighting mobs to get to each one.  so 40 minutes total just to unlock a god damned door!\n\nas for the story, it's a Generic Fantasy with Generic Fantasy races, and I'm pretty sure their main story line was taken straight from Lord of the RIngs. the part about the Age of Elves and Immortals coming to an end, and the age of Man beginning.

As much as they were mentioned I could not tell you the name of the Enemy \"race\" or the Evil Leader of this race. and they name dropped both of them almost every sentence. \n\nI can see why this game bombed so hard when it first released.

I love the world and story its set in, along with the gorgeous music and art. It's not very difficult, which doesn't bother me, but could be a bother for others. It's one of the coolest looking games I've ever played, enough that I've never been able to get into Skyrim, because I keep comparing the visuals to this one. It's fun to take your time with this game, and see all of it, rather than only doing the main quest line. I played it on my brother's account for years before I bought for myself, so I think I've spent roughly 500-600 hours on it overall (across at least 8 characters) since 2012.\n\nIf I could change anything, I would add more options to the character customization, as some hairstyles are only available for certain backgrounds of characters, and the female customization options have a weird kind of permanent eyeshadow above and below the eyes. That can be counteracted by adding a light colored eyeshadow at medium opacity, however. (Also props to this game for having proper women's armor).\n\nLook out for: There's a sidequest, in the Plains of Erathell, that involves taking and cleansing a cursed staff a bandit stole. The location you are supposed to go to to cleanse it has a secret door that is supposed to block the exit until you leave, but it glitched for me and wouldn't open, leaving my character unable to leave the location, and unable to continue the game. I had to start a new character instead. I recommend not taking this sidequest.

Well first off I want to say this is a game that deserves way more praise then it has been given, rather then being scrubbed from the face of history in games, people should remember it as a beautiful, atmospheric and brilliant roleplay game. Its a shame it was overshadowed by so many games, Skyrim being the first of many but we can see why due to how great it was...but this game is great as well in my opinion. I have a lot of things to say about this game so lets get into them.\n\n[h1] [u] The good [/u] [/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]Probably one of the most prettiest games I have ever played\n[*]Combat and and roleplaying capability is hugely varied meaning you can have multiple playthroughs and not get bored\n[*]The story is pretty good and well done\n[*]Genius level up system\n[*]Every area in the game is unique in its own way\n[*]DLC is fun and unique (Although I recommend playing it after the main game as it will help with the problem of not getting bored late game through its max level as I have listed in the bad section)\n[/list]\n\nHowever, I do have some bad points but its not really the developers or the games fault for having them. If more people showed more interest and found the game earlier then this game could have been turned into something masterful and perhaps into a series like it deserves to be. Even though there are quite a few problems and bad points, its still worth playing and you will have fun if you do play it.\n\n[h1] [u] The bad [/u] [/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]As the game goes on, there will be more and more glitches (although in the remastered version there will be considerably less)\n[*]If you dont take breaks from it from time to time you can get bored of it (Although this is just me)\n[*]Voice acting for characters is a little bit over the top (but do remember it is an old game ;) )\n[*]Despite the leveling up system being genius, there is a max level to balance things out which I think makes the game pretty boring since you have nothing to grow as the game goes on and its a very long game if you want to explore everything. Personally I think they should have just increased the enemies level and difficulty and not put a cap on things.\n[/list]\n\nA slight note also, I am playing the first version of the game, not the remastered version which looks even more prettier and has a lot less glitches and problems, however you need a good PC to play it and also its a bit more expensive then the old game (plus the old game has been taken down so you cant buy it anymore for obvious reasons). These points I have made still apply to the remastered version and even though the remastered version is getting torn apart by fans. I still think people should play it since its exactly the same as the game im playing, just with better graphics and less problems.\n\nI hope this review is helpful and overall, Kingdoms of Amalur is a brilliant game with awesome mechanics but with some small issues and it deserves more recognition then it has gotten.

Way, way too long. But I've completed KoA:R with all of the achievements and all of the side quests and all of the DLCs, so I can finally put it to rest.\n\nI know that I'm making it sound like a chore, and it isn't, but KoA:R is just a massive, massive game, and even though the gameplay is good, I like the story to be better told in whatever RPG I'm playing. And frankly, I couldn't tell you what the game is about, because I click-clicked my way through all of the dialog because it's so boring. There's no felicity of style, and that's a shame, because everything else about the game is so good.\n\nKoA:R is almost the opposite of Dragon Age: Origins; in DA:O, very few of the game mechanics function as they should, but the story and characters are so interesting. The crafting is rudimentary, and many of the armours make you look stupid. In KoA:R, the combat is great, and the missions are great, and the crafting is great, and the armour is great, but I just don't care about any of the characters or the story.\n\nThe remastering of the game baffles me, because even though the game came out in 2012, it still looks and sounds good. The visuals were never the problem. It was always that the voice-acting is awful, and the way the dialog is laid out is boring as hell.\n\nAfter a lot of false starts, I finally got to the end of the game as a Universalist, because I wanted to try everything. But I didn't feel underpowered at any point. I didn't struggle. Every build is valid, and every combination works. There's no magic combo that'll make it possible to win the game. It's so well-balanced and fun. And if there's a fight you can't beat, or don't feel like doing? Go into Fate mode (or drink a potion of Fate in case the bar isn't full) and beat the encounter that way.\n\nBut honestly, KoA:R is almost too big. There are just too many sidequests (and many, many tasks that are endlessly repeatable), and the game could have done with trimming the fat just a bit. Aside from that, this is highly recommended.

It is mostly a sandbox type game with a few limitations.\n1) You can't jump off cliffs and such unless there is a spot designated (noted by an arrow).\n2) At times you can get stuck on terrain, but it's not permanent.\n\nAs far as others saying it's not a good game, they obviously are not this type of game player.\nThere is an abundance of quests:  fetch, collect, kill and such.\nBut most games have some form of similar quests.\nThe dialogues with NPC's are pretty good.  I have not encountered any that seemed out of place or spoken badly.\nAnd there is a lot of dialogue (this is a good thing).\nEach person you interact with has something to say (and yes it's repeated at times and on a closely related npc nearby).  But that doesn't detract from the game.\n\nFight mechanics are pretty damn good.\nThere are many types to choose from:\n    Rogue / Assassin types,  mage type and warrior type.\nThere is a lot of gear choices and you can even craft your own.  The crafting system takes some getting used to (with no guidance in game), but you get the feel for it as you go.\nThere isn't much in the way of hand holding and I quite enjoy the options in some dialogues to just say no or be a shit (LOL).\nYou can actually kill anyone (if you so choose), but you will mostly likely end up in jail (for friendly type kills).\n\nI see there is a Re Reckoning for sale, but I have yet to finish this game, there is literally 100 or more hours of play time.\nI don't feel the need to spend more money on a game that according to most of the bad reviews is flawed.\nI personally have only had a couple issues that were easily solved, one due to me alt-tabbing in and out a few times.\nI have not had any crashes, nor lock ups.  The game is pretty polished (not like all the new crap content that has paywalls and loot boxes and forced monetary payments for more content and such).\n\nIf you like games such as Skyrim or Dragons Dogma: Dark Arisen, then this game will keep you entertained and offer tons of enjoyment.  It will also frustrate you at times (LOL) some fights can be very overwhelming.\n\nI suggest if you can get your hands on the original version then do so.  I certainly won't be spending more money on a game that seems more a money grab than anything.  This new trend of wanting to get more money for a game that is old by so-called remastering (I am looking at you Bethesda - Skyrim) is a scourge on the game industry and shows a lack of motivation to create new and exciting games.  I wish game studios would stop trying to suck every last penny from customers with rehashed garbage on a game that had great merits on its own and just make new games.\n\nI also love that this is one of the better solo play (single player) games out there as I don't care nor enjoy playing online games with other players.  Too often multi-player games have a hateful and childish player base that either cries about the game or wants to just grief others out of their fun.\n\nI say keep up the single player games as that is more meaningful to mature players that want to enjoy content at their leisure and not have to log on to some damn track me - try to sell to me platform.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1604260000, "timestamp_updated": 1604260000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78435794": {"recommendationid": "78435794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077839786", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4307, "last_played": 1648730475}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and story telling.

Salvatore for use in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) codenamed Copernicus.\" from wikipedia\n\nThis was, and still is, a gem of a game with some heavy hitters (yes pun intended) behind it, like author R.A. Salvatore, Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, and Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion lead designer Ken Rolston to finally create a single player game named Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.\nThis was the first and last game made by 38 Studios having filed bankruptcy shortly after release.\n\nMy first time playing the game was shortly after release on the Xbox.  I couldn't get enough of the game, as playing hours just melted away like minutes instead,  it's that good.  The visuals, story, combat, all packaged to make a very good RPG game.\n\nWith the recent release of KoA: Re-Reckoning, I decided to pull out my PC version from my pile of steam games to play it again.

I didn't have the DLC then, so those are making a nice change. \n\nI love Amalur. It's pretty, and it's fun. The combat is slick and smooth and easy, and I find it very intuitive. It's easy to respec into a different build, and you can mix and match without being mechanically penalized. There's a ton to do, and the minimap and quest markers make it easy to find. The scenery is gorgeous and interesting. Fast travel is pretty painless. It's very moreish, generally--oh, I'll just do this quest over here, and then there's another quest just over that hill, and so on. Quicksave and quickload are fast and painless[strike], making it easy to savescum persuasion checks, or dispelling chests[/strike]. The lockpicking feature is simple and quick.\n\nDrawbacks, just for the record: There are a fair few common actions that don't have keybinds so you have to mouse to the right place and/or click through a small menu over and over. The graphics are obviously dated. There is not much scope for roleplaying. No romance, even with the Maid of Windemere who wants you to rule at her side. If you go back to earlier areas, they won't recognize new titles you've earned. Clearly designed centering straight men, because women hit on the PC all the time, and men never do--this is a plus for me, as a lesbian playing a female character, but it is pretty obvious, and so are the male-gaze costumes on characters like Alyn Shir. (Oh my god please put on some actual clothes, that collection of belts cannot be comfortable.) It is [i]incredibly[\\i] easy to overlevel, especially if you're at all a completionist. As far as I can tell, unique items are locked to the level where you were when you got them, so if you get them too early they're rubbish forever. No armor cosmetics, my clothes are so tragically ugly. Dispelling curses is, for me at least, impossibly difficult and I just have to savescum autoattempts. The lore holds no real surprises if you've consumed any fantasy rpgs in the past twenty years.\n\nI realize that drawbacks paragraph is longer than the positives one, but that's just because I'm being specific and picky! Most of these things don't actually bother me much, I just strive to be informative when I leave reviews.

There are 3 skill trees and a set of skills to develop as you level, very classic RPG things. The combat is fluid enough and there are plenty of ways to handle enemy and boss encounters. Difficulty is a joke, even on hard, most enemies simply do not hit very much. \n\n- The Good -\n\nEvery single character and quest is voice acted with most of it being varied with competent enough actors. There are not a ton of different actors so many characters will sound similar, but it's a nice touch and it did add to the immersion. The game world is varied and enjoyable to look at with pleasant graphics and a unique enough aesthetic. There are 5 main regions to explore with smaller sub regions filled with dungeons and quests to keep you busy throughout the game. The combat is engaging and satisfying, it won't be difficult to pick up and be proficient at within long. Story is good enough, not a lot of depth but it holds together well enough.\n\n- The Bad -\n\nI won't complain toooooooooooo much but there are a few key annoyances that might make you not want to play this game. A full play through, doing every quest and dungeon is around 100 hours. After about 5 hours you will have seen every monster and seen every type of dungeon. The last 95 hours is XP grinding the same looking things until you max you character level and win the game. Every single attack an enemy can do will stagger you character, making you unable to move or attack for about 0.8 seconds. Every enemy attack is also homing, even most melee attacks so you HAVE to roll/blink or block everything unless you are behind cover or our of range, simply moving to avoid won't cut it. There are 2 mage types in the ENTIRE game. The first is the spammer with 3 different types of spammy attacks and a summoner type which can summon a couple monsters depending on what the lore tells them to. Summoners are so rare I think I saw less than 10 in the whole game. Speaking of lack of variety, there are maybe 8 different types of monsters to fight in the game and every boss except 2 or 3 is a re-skin of a regular monster. I like the music in this game, but there are so few tracks that i'm totally sick of them after a couple hours if there is any music playing at all, most of it is a short jingle when you enter an area. The game can also bug out at any point and brick you from completing the main quest line. That did not happen to me luckily but be warned, its a game from a studio that went under right after release so its not perfect by any means. The DLC is also not available anymore so good luck getting the 11 DLC achievements. The achievements suck anyways, not a good reflection of game completion nor achievement so don't bother too much with them.\n\n- Conclusion -\n\nI may sound like I didn't like the game but I personally did. It's a depthless, simple player MMO that requires no thought that you can steamroll to your pleasure. The combat is either with you or against you but it won't defeat you so whatever, just pop relentless assault and say fuck it and destroy everything in your path.\n\nThere is one thing that I found sums up the game perfectly. There is an ability where you can bash with your shield to 'open up' enemies for an attack. Well, there is only 1 monster that blocks you in the entire game and shield bash will in fact NOT open him up for at attack. Thought that was funny as shit. \n\nAnyway, if you see the game for a few bucks its worth a play despite my criticisms, you do not have to do everything but you might want to anyways. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1601936552, "timestamp_updated": 1602837706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77081201": {"recommendationid": "77081201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062873595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 834, "last_played": 1602224283}, "language": "english", "review": "I have always been a fan of this type of game, and this game in particular. so when they decided to reissue and revamp it to some extent I was all in.

I missed this game during its release but got it on steam a while ago and only managed to try it now cuz to be honest, I totally forgot about this game like most people did, its the type of a game that isnt really bad at all but has been forgotten because..... its very mediocre, forgettable and just average, I wanted to like this because I do enjoy some fantasy settings, even tho Im not really into Fantasy RPGs today as I was like a decade ago, I can still enjoy a game of this genre, I just need to be impressed and Amalur didnt do anything to impress me, I spent almost 5 hours playing it till I had to put the game down as I had no interest to continue due to boredom and just lack of motivation, the game refused to impress me on the story aspect because the plot and everything that is going on is so static and devoid of any emotion, every single character feel like a NPC from some soulless MMORPG, they are just here to give very formulaic quests and this is exactly how the game feels like, an offline MMORPG, I think people would enjoy it much more if coop was available but its just a chore to play as a singleplayer game, the soundtrack is good and the combat is kinda fun altho the game is ridiculously easy as you progress which trivializes the whole character build system and makes the game even more boring since theres no challenge at all.\n\nThe quest design, the way the maps were designed, the story, characters and even the flow of the game is so formulaic and just bland, emotionless and boring, yeah the combat is fine but fighting the same enemy for no reason for the tenth time because I had to drop some item from him or entering a cave to get some loot or just talk to some characters here and there then tescort a NPC to the nearby village, sell your loot rinse and repeat while nothing interesting happens, theres so much I can take of this repetitive boredom before I lose interest and this is a problem that plagues tons of other games, amalur brings nothing to make things more interesting or even unique, they could try at least giving us an interesting story but even for that they failed, all you do in this game is MMO Tier-level busywork, it all follows the same cake recipe that has been done to death in the most generic way possible and for that reason this game got forgotten over time and as any game that manage to make me drop it before I even get halfway through it makes it an automatic no-recommendation from me, the only thing that could have saved this \"offline mmorpg\" was if it had some sort of coop or even multiplayer function, if you could play this with the presence of another person then I would say that the experience would have been at least bearable I guess but sadly it simply isnt.", "timestamp_created": 1599948114, "timestamp_updated": 1654521552, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483039289712905884", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75871409": {"recommendationid": "75871409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046662585", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3576, "last_played": 1600519982}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, I think it is the best.", "timestamp_created": 1599944568, "timestamp_updated": 1599944568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75852127": {"recommendationid": "75852127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078554377", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1602209039}, "language": "english", "review": "as of right now, original >= remake.

I got the game when it was on sale, and a few months before the Re-Reckoning announcement, so I can't speak to the quality of the remaster, though if half of what I've read is true, then they are not all that dissimilar and you can apply this review to the remaster as well.\n\nAs for the game itself:\n\nPROS:\n\nCombat - Extremely customizable and fluid. There are built-in systems so that you don't have to worry about pigeonholing yourself into a single class or category only to regret it later on in the game.\n\nSize - The map, story, and game in general is just immense. As of the time of this review, I've sunk over 100 hours in and I've only scratched the surface of the game.\n\nStory - It's a refreshing take on \"the chosen one\" trope that feels fresh and really draws you in.\n\nStyle - The colors of the world are amazing, very much styled after an MMORPG akin to WoW or - to make perhaps a lesser known reference - Rift. That is to say, everything is bright and fanciful in a very story-book kind of way that you don't often get with other fantasy open world RPGs.\n\nCONS:\n\nCharacterization - The NPCs in KoA are not exactly memorable in the way that the NPCs in a game like Skyrim are. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that the game is so similar to an MMO, the NPC's never really feel very fleshed out. This is something that an MMO can generally get away with, since there are other real people in the world to interact with, but when it's a single player RPG, there's less wiggle room there. As I played the game, I found that I really didn't care about the characters, and so I never felt invested in any of the side quests, and there are sooo many side quests.\n\nCharacter customization - This is a small issue, but it bothered me all the same. I played as a human male my first time through, and when I was customizing my character, I was disappointed at the lack of options. I spent quite a long time in the character creator, and I found that no matter which options I tried, each time it felt like the end result was a barely-altered version of a preset mold. Again, this is something you come to expect from an MMORPG, but in a single player game I expected there to be more options and I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.\n\nStaleness - I've mentioned already that there are so, so many side quests in this game. In fact, the vast majority of the hours I've spent in Amalur thus far have nearly all been completing side quests, which for me is great - I love getting into the world and doing all the little things in a game, especially an RPG. However, it did not take long for me to realize that there was definitely a formula at work behind the scenes, and soon all the quests started to feel like slightly varied versions of themselves. KoA relies heavily on the \"X needs help with Y > Travel to dungeon > Clear dungeon > Do Y > Return to X > Collect reward\" format. Now, I know that a lot of RPGs have this same problem - The Witcher III comes to mind - but this issue is usually dealt with by utilizing intriguing characters that keep you invested and grinding because you generally care about the outcome, and as I've already said, KoA doesn't fair very well in the characterization department.\n\nTravel - I've mentioned this in the \"PROS\" list above, but it's worth saying again; the map is massive. I've not explored a fourth of it yet, and I'm over a hundred hours in. Now, that's not to say you couldn't blast through and explore the whole thing in half that time or less, but that's not how I play and I like to investigate all the nooks and corners of a world because I'm me. That being said, there is no horse or mount that I've seen or heard of in the game, and while there are several places you can fast-travel to, you still end up walking quite far distances in-game, covering large areas that you've already explored just to get from point A to point B, and well, that's a bit annoying but not a huge deal.\n\nYou can't jump - This is another small thing, but it bears mentioning I think because it's a mechanic that does ultimately affect game play and traversal. There have been several times when I've needed to get to point A, which was just on the other side of a waist-high wall or outcropping, but since I couldn't jump, I had to go on a hike around and through mountain passes and dozens of enemies just to talk to some gnome of fae that had previously been a stone's throw from where I was standing. It's extremely bad when a quest has you going back to the same spot more than once, and having to go through the same enemies and around the ridiculous path when you could just jump and have it all done in a few minutes.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nSo, bearing all that in mind, do I recommend the game? At full price, sure. If you can get it on sale? Absolutely. \n\nFor all of its quirks, it really is a solid game that can give you hours and hours of game play in a beautiful world with some pretty badass combat. \n\nMy insight to anyone who is thinking of buying this game is this: it's a single player MMORPG. That's what this is, and if it lacks anything it's by virtue of this fact. So, if you've ever played an MMORPG and wished you could have the whole world to yourself, this is your game 100%. However, do not go into it thinking it's going to be similar to an Elder Scrolls, Witcher, Dragon Age, or the like, it is not that kind of game. Once you understand that, you can really enjoy the game, as it really is a hidden gem and deserves to be better known.\n\nAnd Ellen, if you're reading this, I appreciated the recommendation and I'm glad to have played this game.\n\nTL;DR\n\n7/10 - It's a single player MMORPG", "timestamp_created": 1599846714, "timestamp_updated": 1599846714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75800348": {"recommendationid": "75800348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027053614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 12208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10778, "last_played": 1627820010}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Game", "timestamp_created": 1599837878, "timestamp_updated": 1599837878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75781427": {"recommendationid": "75781427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157188871", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1599802820}, "language": "english", "review": "I heard this game was getting a remake and I played it way back in the day and remembered enjoying playing a caster, and it's been sitting in my collection for a while so I installed it and figured what the hell, let's play an olde for the good ol' days.\n\nMy good old days are dead and this port killed them.\n\nHere's the thing; best I can tell, dodging seems utterly pointless, enemies just track you through it.  Stealth is utterly pointless, sure it's in the game but you get spotted by one or more enemies unless stealth is maxed out, I presume, so again pointless.  If you wanna play a caster or a knightly sir who's gonna tank hits anyway then sure knock yourself out but stealth gameplay is out the window for me and with it so is this game.  I refuse to pour another hour into this in the hopes I'll get to do what I wanted to.  I'm glad to have some fond memories of this but as of right now I simply can't recommend this version of the game.\n\nAnother bone to pick is; to bring it up to modern standards you'll have to use a widescreen fix 3rd party freeware, because while it gives you the option to set the game to 2k rez, it displays that in pillbox 4:3 so enjoy that if you can, if you can't, the fix works but it's annoying to mess with and you'll likely have to switch your rez around until it FINALLY kicks in.\n\nCan't/ won't recommend and I likely won't pickup the remake, there are better RPGs out there that I might actually get some pleasure out of.  If you like the game more power to you, we don't have to agree and I genuinely hope you have a better time of it than I just did,because personally I'd like my evening back. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1599803562, "timestamp_updated": 1599803562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.389751791954040527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75778797": {"recommendationid": "75778797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019496345", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1368, "last_played": 1600042853}, "language": "english", "review": "KOM:R is a very solid RPG overall; I feel like it was generally under-rated or overlooked on release.

There is a ton of Lore to take in but it isn't so deep that you need to analyze much of it too much. It is totally possible to Enjoy this game as an action adventure and much less and RPG by just mashing through the dialogue and quests. The combat isn't the best it could be but its fast and fluid. \n\nThere are of course some downsides. There are uber beefy big enemies who make encounters kind of annoying the more of them turn up in battle. There isn't much variation to the type of enemies, however, there are a lot of enemies and higher frequencies of battles as you progress the game. Its possible to get stuck in a wall but depending on where you are, you may be able to fast travel out of there or you will unfortunately be forced to reload from a previous checkpoint. \n\nYou get a ton of Loot. A lot of it. The issue is you have to cut adventures short only because loot is filling your pockets and and if you want more loot, you have to painfully junk and delete items or go back to your storage or sell junked items. The storage wouldn't be an issue, if you could take items apart on the go or send it to an unlimited storage box (in which the player extra storage only has 155 slots). \n\nNow, because of the storage limitations you will end up with millions of gold coins. You will be selling big batches of items, weapons, and armors  constantly. This puts a damper on the difficulty of the game since its real easy to stay kitted out. \n\nThis game has a ton of content, including discontinued DLC in this version. I completed 100+ Quests before finishing the game and beating my quest took 62 hours. What I also liked about the game is the ability to make world altering decisions. I played my character as someone more spontaneous when making bigger decisions. I racked up a ton of betrayals and got rewarded for being treacherous.

However, it doesn't really bring anything special to the table. In particular, the skill/class system is much less flexible than I'd like - there are effectively 7 classes, and you almost have to spend points on skills you won't use - but if you aren't particularly invested in making every single point count this will be less of an issue.\n\n## Story ##\n+ The Fae are pretty cool and have interesting stuff going on. I wish the game let you explore that more.\n+/- Many zones that are large and have lots of side quests. Some side quests are interesting/fun, others are not.\n- The main plot really never sucked me in - especially because it's drip-fed across several large zones with plenty of sidequests in-between, so it's hard to remember what's going on.\n## Leveling up ##\n- Not all point distributions are good. There are 3 skill trees for you to put points in, but you really want to either put all your points in one, or split evenly across 2-3. 100 points in Might is good, 50 Might/50 Finesse is good, but 70 Might/30 Finesse is bad (you miss out on strong buffs/basically class features)\n- Skill trees are arranged so you basically have to put points into things you won't use, which is especially annoying for cross-skill play. There are low- and high-tier weapon types (e.g. chakrams are better than staff), but the high-tier weapons are also on tier 2 of the skill tree and you basically have to put points into the low-tier ones.

The unique gear items look awesome but often have subpar stats.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1597020866, "timestamp_updated": 1597020866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74050882": {"recommendationid": "74050882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072942481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 6001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6001, "last_played": 1597009879}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game.

Having chipped away at it an hour at a time, I've finally finished KOA to 100% completion, for the second time! Having played this game back on the PS3 AT LAUNCH, and bought all the DLC as they came out, it's one of my favorite RPGs on the last generation. Even playing it again all these years later, I still enjoyed it for the most part! I would have liked to have finished it sooner, but when life's busy with work, you do what you must. I would have loved to have finished and reviewed this sooner BEFORE they unlisted this from Steam to make way for the remaster, which I should point out I invested 40 hours into before the actual remaster was fully announced (I seem to have that luck, play a game then a remaster is announced.) It would have given some more people a chance to play the original, but hopefully the remaster will remain close to the same. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2190798046\n\nKOA is an action rpg with some very frantic combat, that offers lots of choices on how you want to play. You can go warrior, rouge, mage, a mixture of 2, or even a bit of all 3! Weapons aren't locked to classes so you can always switch it up on the fly when ever you want when you start getting bored. My main was always a warrior/rouge build with 2 handed swords and daggers for the stealth kills. Using crits to kill most enemies in single hits. After I completed the main game I switch to a warrior/mage build to play more with spells just for something different. My only REAL complaints are some fights you can get horribly combo against where you can't dodge or block and just have your whole health bar melt in seconds. The worst issue though is the camera during combat. You don't get any real control, it just does what ever and can and will get stuck on things, or clip through the floor or wall and can't see what you are doing. It was always an issue at release and it's still here. I did play K&M the entire time.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2167600934\n\nOne thing that I loved KoA for is all characters are fully voiced. Most games at the time did not do this or took shortcuts. Tons and tons of lore to find in this beautiful and ginormous world to explore! Include the DLC areas, and you will be here for over 100+ hours exploring and doing quests. Now, if you sit through all the dialog and complete every quest on the way, you are looking at 200+ hours of content. Because I've beat this game previously, I've skipped 90% of the dialog, so I JUST squeezed in at 98 hour to 100% complete the entire game. I will say some quests are fairly boring and repetitive, at least in the base game. There is lots to do and you will need to do them to get the XP needed to power yourself up! I do personally like the DLCs better, as the maps are smaller and are just more memorable.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2190821417\n\nI know I should probably try and explain better why I love this game so much, but I'm just burnt out trying to finish this game in the last 3 months, and honestly there is better reviews out there... Especially when you can't buy this version anymore. Either way, I look forward to the remaster! Guess we will find out when that shows up. I don't think I'll be playing it any time soon, at least not till this \"new\" content they are making it comes out. If you have the chance to check out KoA, be sure to set LOTS of spare time, cause you are going to need it!\n\n[h1] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32912601-Aythadis/] My Currator Page for My Other Reviews!

And since unlocking additional weapon moves is locked in to progress down the ability trees, you spend half the game without access to the more varied attacks, meaning that most of the time you'll just be hitting your attack button and blocking/dodging occasionally.\n\nThe combat balance is almost non-existent, enemies are almost universally completely trivial other than the occasional one who is an annoying damage sponge and does hilariously disproportionate damage, and there's only about a dozen different enemies who are palette swapped and recycled throughout the course of the game. The most challenging part of the combat is dealing with the abysmal camera, which has a mind of its own and loves to zoom right in on you when you're surrounded by enemies, only stopping to clip through the scenery and get stuck under the floor occasionally.\n\nThere's a variety of non-combat skills to choose from (lockpicking, stealth, persuasion and so on) which are generally either absolutely bloody useless, or hilariously overpowered. Depending on which ones you choose you can end up completely trivialising the game without even trying, but with a little care you can max out almost all of the skills anyway which makes any sense of choice completely redundant.\n\nThe ability trees are probably the highlight of the game, there's a lot of different abilities to choose from, and thankfully you can respec your character at any time to try different things out. Depending on how you want to play, you can either go deep into one of the trees (magic, might, or finesse, which broadly correspond to the standard mage/warrior/rogue archetypes) or split your points across two or even all three trees. Putting enough points into one tree or a combination of trees unlocks \"destinies\" which give you added stats and bonus abilities and can make different ability builds feel very different from each other. Ultimately, however, it's still limited by the shallow nature of the combat system, and however you build your character you'll inevitably end up spamming the same basic attacks over and over again.\n\nThe real issue is with the pacing of the game. Every single town you come across is chock full of completely forgettable NPCs who will bury you up to your eyeballs in fetch quests and kill quests which give no real rewards but make you slog all over the place anyway. Either you try and do everything out of an obsessive sense of completionism, or you get bored of that by the second or third town, rush through the main quests, and realise there's really not that much game under all that padding. There are half a dozen factions with their own sidequest chains that have a bit more structure to them, but none of them really add much to the game, and aside from some minor stat boosts it makes absolutely no difference to anything whether you do them or not.\n\nOverall it's a thoroughly mediocre experience through and through, which never manages to be amazingly good or offensively bad. If you like third-person action RPG games it ticks pretty much all of the boxes, it does everything more or less adequately without ever really impressing, it all looks nice enough and there's a whole bunch of lore if you can be bothered to pay attention to it. Pick it up in a sale and it'll give you a good thirty hours or so of moderate entertainment, but it's a mostly unremarkable experience with next to no replay value.", "timestamp_created": 1596445974, "timestamp_updated": 1596445974, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73687663": {"recommendationid": "73687663", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963146160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 2214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2214, "last_played": 1596432248}, "language": "english", "review": "This is like the american version of eurojank.

The Elder Scrolls comparisons are pretty obvious, which is to be expected when Oblivion's lead designer was involved, but there is more than enough to set it apart. For a start there's no series baggage to worry about going in; it's a fresh story with no references to be missed. The combat is far better than Elder Scrolls has ever accomplished, combat feels frenetic and has a lot of variety even if movesets are tied to weapon types. Oher aspects have definitely be simplified, but not in any detrimental way that makes the title feel lacking.\n\nBeyond a shallow Elder Scrolls comparison, Kingdoms of Amalur is an engaging title, very easy to get immersed into the world especially with some great story and dialogue. The world is gorgeous, very vibrant and detailed with a lot of that detail missable if you never take the time to look upwards. Though graphically it does show its age somewhat with its rather intense xbox 360 era bloom and short distance LoD pop-in, as well as a lot of reused assets both in terms of models but also parts of dungeons that are noticeably reused across the world, which of course isn't that surprising for the genre. At the time of this review I'm currently 60 hours into my first playthrough, I haven't even finished up the Alfaria side of the map, nevermind Fortenmar or the two DLC maps, that's testament to the sheer amount of content available. Highly recommend, though it seems you can't buy this directly from Steam anymore I believe you can still buy keys elsewhere, try to get this version instead of Re-Reckoning if you can.\n\nEdit: If the extra 40 hours added to my playtime to finish the main game and the two DLC area's is indication of anything, it would be the fact this game has a lot of content. Anyway, since they removed the three DLC pages before I had the chance to review them, here's a brief rundown.\n\n[b]Weapons and Armor Bundle:[/b]\nUtterly pointless, even if they did scale appropriately (locked to the level you are when you enter the first area of the game), the sets have better alternatives (self-crafted or other sets) and even as early game \"boosts\" are quickly outclassed.\n\n[b]Legend of Dead Kel:[/b]\nMixed feelings. Conceptually I really like the ideas they went with but I'm not sold on the implementation, particularly Gravehal and it's faction quests which end up feeling a lot like busy work than fully realised content. In other areas the DLC improves on aspects of the main game, like dungeon design.\n\n[b]Teeth of Naros:[/b]\nPretty great overall, engaging story and some neat dungeons that feel more vertical opposed to the rather flat layouts found in the main game, Nerotelos being one of the highlights.

The influences of games like World of Warcraft (2004), Dragon Age (2009), and the Legend of Zelda series are strong with this one. If you are looking for a  Dark Souls challenge, you will not find it here. Personally I enjoyed the semi-casual difficulty because I wanted a fun and semi-relaxing game that can provide hours and hours of entertainment and this game delivers. \n\nAt the start there are three classes to choose from, Warrior, Rogue, and Mage. Unlike so many games in the genre, KoA allows for hybrid classes. Players can specialize in one skill set or be a jack of all trades, at the cost of being master of none using \u201ctalent points\u201d or skill points (gained from level ups) increasing the power of abilities and acquiring new abilities. I chose to play as a Warrior dabbling a bit in magic.\n\n[u]Tips for beginners[/u]:\n\u2022\tUse \u201cFast Travel\u201d often (once you have discovered a town or dungeon/cave simply click on the map and the location you want to instantly travel to) it is superior to portals and mounts in World of Warcraft.\n\u2022\tLook for Backpacks (Bags) on vendors, each one will increase the amount you can carry by 10.\n\u2022\tThrough completing the right quests, a player can earn a house at three different locations, and further into the game a castle. Among other benefits, owned houses contain a special chest/stash where most inventory items can be stored providing a player much needed inventory space.\n\u2022\tSet gears (yellow quality) are inferior to gears which can be crafted at a Blacksmith forge, this is especially true of \u201cMastercrafted\u201d gears later on when a player has maximum Blacksmithing skill. The set gears appeared to be designed more for aesthetic uniqueness more than anything.\n\u2022\tA couple of full sets can be acquired through completing quest lines for a couple of different factions. Completing the House of Ballads faction quests will net a set for casters, completing the Travelers faction quests will net a set for rogues. Completion of each faction quest line will provide bonuses to character stats.\n\u2022\tIf you have ever spent much time with World of Warcraft you will already understand the coloring system used to indicate the quality of items, white for junk, green for common, blue for rare, purple for epic and so on. \n\u2022\tIt is not necessary to follow the storyline closely, pressing X (I used a PS3 controller) will speed up the dialogue. Only where decisions are made is a prior basic understanding of the storyline helpful to choosing your path. I made one mistake early on out of skipping the rather lengthy dialogues, price paid for impatience.  \n\n[u]Current Stats[/u]:\n\u2022\tLevel 37 (only 3 away from Level cap)\t\n\u2022\t32/61 Achievements (15 of these less than 20.5% players have attained, 7 of them less than 10.6% of players. Must say I am surprised more players have not unlocked these achievements, I doubt it is due to difficulty, because for the most part it is not a difficult game.)\n\u2022\t161 Quests completed\n\u2022\t4.5 million gold\n\u2022\t1,574+ screenshots\n\u2022\tI stopped counting the cups of coffee at 150.\n\n[u]Pros[/u]: \n\u2022\tAmazing graphics (2012), textures, lighting effects, etc.  \n\u2022\tAverage to above average soundtrack, sound effects, and voice acting.\n\u2022\tHuge world to explore, provides hours of entertainment.\n\u2022\tGameplay is fun and precise with a surprising variety of moves/abilities. \n\n[u]Cons[/u]:\n\u2022\tThe bugs are not all worked out. For example, I discovered an inventory bug which applies to the House of Ballads armor set. After the items went into my inventory, I was able to add to junk (to sell) but I decided I might save the set for in case I decided to change my \u201cfate\u201d to a Mage (though it is not necessary to equip this particular set), so I put the armors into my stash. Later I decided I wanted to sell the set to make more stash space. Turns out after placing the gear into the stash adding it back into inventory binds it to a player making it so the gear cannot be added to junk and sold at a vendor.\n\u2022\tConsidering the size and length of the game world, a greater variety of enemies and environments would have been appreciated. Also I like big bosses, the kind that make you think !!! There are too few end of dungeon/cave bosses which produce feeling of intimidation and dread.\n\u2022\tThis has been said by other players and it only hit me about 120 hours in, but aspects do get somewhat repetitive, but this is fairly common in games designed to be time sinks.\n\nAll in all my complaints are minor and should not detract people from giving this game a chance. Honestly I am not the type of person or gamer (since the 80\u2019s) who spends a great deal of time with any one game for hours upon hours. Few games can suck me in and hold my attention for a substantial amount of time. Two games come to mind, games I had difficulty spending only short amounts of time with, World of Warcraft and Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning pawned me.\n\nIn conclusion, on a scale of 1-10, I give this game an 8.9, which is almost perfect, but not without minor flaws.", "timestamp_created": 1595910492, "timestamp_updated": 1595994879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73397413": {"recommendationid": "73397413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198971476229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1599275441}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun", "timestamp_created": 1595906190, "timestamp_updated": 1595906190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73367828": {"recommendationid": "73367828", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994597411", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7982, "last_played": 1603041799}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de mis juegos favoritos, lo he terminado 3 veces y cada cierto tiempo vuelvo a instalarlo, esto puedo decirlo de muy pocos juegos.

this game on the Xbox 360 at the urging of a friend of mine who worked at GameStop a long long time ago.  And to this day I still thank him for showing it to me.  There is no division into pros and cons, because this game really has no cons to me.  \n\nThe graphics are charming.  To me, the character models, environment, weapons, and armor still hold up to this day, though I just assume the \"Re-Reckoning\" remaster will simply improve audio and graphics quality without taking away from the core gameplay.  I enjoy the art style.  \n\nCharacter creation is not as in depth as some RPGs, but it is just enough to allow me to make multiple characters of the same race or different races and they all look unique.  \n\nCombat is where this game really shines.  You can flow seamlessly from magic to melee weapons and back to magic with little to no trouble at all.  The developers truly mastered the ability for the player to use both forms of combat when fighting the enemy.  \n\nStory is excellent.  There are many side missions to this game that can keep you entertained for quite a long time as well as multiple DLCs to play through after the main story is completed.  \n\nWhile the world is large it's not necessarily open.  There are a lot of linear paths and dungeons.  Unlike in Skyrim, Oblivion, or ESO, you can't just take off running in a certain direction toward your objective.  You have to stick somewhat close to roads or paths in order to reach your destination.  There are a few large open areas, but they are more or less a mile or so in area.  Not miles.  \n\nThis game has many great qualities that threatens to let this game replace TESIV Oblivion as my favorite RPG.  It comes very, very close, but Oblivion was a big part of my childhood, so I can't let that happen.  All in all, I give this game a 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1595663786, "timestamp_updated": 1595663786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73240439": {"recommendationid": "73240439", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990385322", "num_games_owned": 508, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 807, "last_played": 1597538609}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a very popular RPG, despite some big name backing, and rather public... happenstances, this still manages to be a very good game.

So don't think it's bad 'cause you didnt even know it existed. This game is Amazing! the world is gorgeous, the abilites you get are fun to use and have, YOU. CONTROL. FATE. literally as an ability, you change the fates of the people around you and you get see it unfold before you, you choose your path much like Skyrim to be just a warrior? how about a Rogue? Spell caster? All three? or a combo? You allocate those points and make decisions based upon your play style, The world is decently big and I love this game. I only have 32 hours on PC, but i have much more on the 360, when it came out, Yea I know, 360 graphic but actually this game is still beautiful and it's not 'cause of the nostalgia glasses. It actually still looks good. \n\nSo Pros: Better story than skyrim imo, it doesn't boil down to BAD DRAGON MUST KILL! xD, and is very fun to experience. Graphics hold up! Fun classes! Great combat! You choose your path! Control the Fates as you see fit! Among others but i'll be here all day. Interesting encounters, Interesting monsters and creatures.\n\nThe Cons: you run everywhere, fast travel does exist but no mounts you gotta hoof it there. Some very forgetable NPC's the main boss is kinda meh tbh imo. but I love some of the supporting Characters. I wont name any as to not spoil anything. ^^\n\nOverall: If I had to rate this game it's easily 8-9.5 the only reason it doesn't get a 10 is 'cause that unrealistic. There will be no video game that ever gets a 10, but if you love Skyrim your rating should be up there as well.

I can only confirm that this is a game you should have played. Especially if you enjoyed Skyrim other similar games. There are many things that make Amalur what it is, I'll go ahead and mention those which stood out to me in particular. \n\n[b] Combat [/b]\nTo this day one of my most favourite implementations of fluid combat in an RPG. It has some aspect of a Hack'n Slash games, but you can go with the abilities of your choice. You can mix up moves mid-combat, switch weapons on the fly and you have an \"ulitmate ability\" for lack of better words that is just completely insane and very pleasing if you pull it off the right way. An additional bonus points: Rogues can actually hold their own in open combat. So if you screw up a stealth kill, you don't have to run for the hills and come back later. Speaking of stealth kills. Those animations, oh boy.\n\n[b] Music [/b]: The background music is for me how gamesoundtracks should be: In the background, gentle, helps you to truely sink into the world without disturbing you or trip you up by suddendly changing. You don't realize how much it builds the atmosphere but if you would turn off the sound, a substantional part would be missing. Each situation has it's assigned, individual soundtrack, so even without seeing you can always tell where you are and what you are doing. Genuine great work!\n\n[b] Various things [/b]\nBoss battles: There aren't many sadly, but those which are present will put you to the test if you are not carefull. There are two big boss battles which will make you feel like you challenge the world, and you will feel like a badass once you won.\nLooting system: This is a bit of a love-hate relationship. You can find weapons, armour etc in almost every looting container out there. Which means you can get an epic weapon (those are unique weapons with special stats and designs. Very cool!) in a puddle. Not kidding, this is how I got my greatsword which I used for a good chunk of one of my playthroughs. While this is great to get loot, it is also a good way to miss out on loot. Which will have you turn every stone in sight in fear of missing that one set piece you are missing.\nStory: A neat story which actually explains why your character is overpowered. There are some surprises here and there but nothing too mind-blowing. It's not an epic tale you'd tell your friends but it helps to carry the game. While this was enough for me, others might expect more. Up to personal preference.\nClass system: This is mentioned a lot. You can mix up the traditional classes of mage, rogue and warrior to create unique playstyles and offer different bonuses. You can reset them at any time, if you have enough ingame gold. Which usually isn't a problem.\nCrafting: You can level up crafting and make your own equipment which is actually quite well balanced with other gear. It doesn't look that cool but if you want to go down this road, you surely can.\n\n[b] Flaws [/b]\nWelp, no game is without and Amalur definitely has some of its own. The face animations of NPCs are sometimes off which has them talking with closed lips. Graphics may be too low for some. The combat can get repetitive once you know the enemies movement pattern by heart (you can try using a new weapon to counteract that) and there isn't much enemy variety. Sure, there are upgraded versions of basic enemies. But their design is only altered slightly and the movement set is expanded a little. You don't feel like you are fighting a new enemy but an old one upgraded. Some may not be bothered by this, I was a bit. You will become overpowered if you quest a lot which I did, this dulls the late game somewhat. Speaking of, I feel like the last of the 5 regions you can visit is a bit too linear. Perhaps this is to fit the story, perhaps to fit the deadline...\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nAt the end, the good far outweights the bad. Amalur offers an unique approach to RPGs which deserves your attention. How much you are willing to spend is up to you but you will get around 30h gametime for sure, not counting in the DLCs. If you do a lot of quests and prefer to start a second playthrough over switching mid one, even 100h should be possible. 100 hours spent gloriously mowing down enemies in a rich and beautiful crafted world which, at the end of the day, should be the goal of any RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1594887149, "timestamp_updated": 1594887242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72763309": {"recommendationid": "72763309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447979626", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 5635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5635, "last_played": 1575835389}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1594865060, "timestamp_updated": 1594865060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72762626": {"recommendationid": "72762626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106773147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3320, "last_played": 1609351267}, "language": "english", "review": "A Very Nice game!

Salvatore, Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion lead designer Ken Rolston. Although this game was not exactly the best result for 38 Studios, considering how they filed for bankruptcy shortly after its release, it is still a decent game with predominantly everything that you'd expect out of a \"poster-cut-out\" RPG. \n\nEssentially, you start out as a complete nobody, sadly like how many of us are in real life, until you are discovered to contain a special power or life-force of uncertain heroism, again like how many of us are NOT in real life, and as you would expect, your job to is to find out more about yourself and fulfill your destiny as the world's saviour. Although this game initially received mixed feelings when it was first released, you have got to hand it to the developers of 38 Studios that the general idea of a single man/woman being the supposed \"chosen one\" meant to save all of mankind and defeat the dark evils, that probably lurks just under your bed, is not a terribly overrated idea. This is considering, how many other games such as Skyrim, Greedfall, Witcher 2, Sekiro, StarWars: KOTOR, and many other similarities, have either fully adopted or partially used a strand of this primitive outline for their own storylines. I'm not saying that these games have done exactly like Kingdoms of Amalur, but rather, these games had done it better, with the exception of StarWars: KOTOR as that game is of its own supreme level and thus, might be covered by yours truly, in the future.\n\nThe gameplay, I would say feels like if the original God of War games had a baby with Dragon Age, and then in the mix came polygamy with Darksiders... then yeah, that's probably the best short description I can give you. On a real note, the gameplay wraps around a skill-based system where timing your button pressing skills would lead you to victory. Also, just like most action-based-button-pressings RPG's, this one does include a \"rage mode\", in or in this case, a \"fate mode\" where you literally wrestle with fate and use it to bash your enemy's head in. Sadly, unless you're into a full achievements Olympic track record, the replayability is not exactly there. Like Witcher 3, Kingdoms of Amalur is essentially a cakewalk after a few hours of character progression on the hardest difficulty and the only reason, that I would personally find, for going back would be the outcomes of the choices you make throughout the game.\n\nLast but not least, the look of the game is amazing. It could be your alternate, less people-ish / less community-ish World of Warcraft game since the graphics, if you were to compare it, looks fairly similar. However, if you think that this game does not look like a Gordon Ramsay's Special Beef Wellington, then I have news for you.

Lots of ways to develop your character and all builds are viable. You can be a jack of all trades or specialize. I went full magic and had a blast. The DLC story adds a way to craft custom weapons at which point it becomes a contest of how much you will overkill by due to the way damage boost stacks in this game (multipliers don't boost base damage, they boost current damage so it very quickly scales out of proportion). I killed the endgame DLC boss with a single autoattack :) Do note that if you are a minmaxer/completionist, you will need to get your Excel spreadsheet out and carefully plan things out. One annoyance is that each skill has 4 skill trainers (each can be used once) that can only be used within a specific skill point range (there are 9 skills with 10 levels each, trainers exist for levels 0-3, 0-3, 4-6, 7-9). If you assign too many skill points yourself, you miss a chance for a \"free\" skill point (you pay the trainer money).

I am loving the lore that they give you throughout the game, the plot is interesting, the world is gorgeous, and the battle system is one of my favorite battle systems I've played in most any open-world rpg. While the character customization is a tid bit sparse, I am still able to create a character that looks good. One thing about the battle system that I absolutely adore (and that is present in a lot of my fave games) is the ability to use multiple weapons. It looks as though you also have the ability to combine battle styles later on into something truly unique. \n\nAlso of note, giving me the ability to name the weapons/armor I create is dangerous. I will come up with the worst possible names for those things. That's part of the fun, though. \n\nThere are only a few issues I have with the game that MAY have solutions that I haven't found yet? The first being that screenshots are automatically in .bmp format, which is not an ideal format for me when I wanna show off my character. I basically have to use steam's screenshot system, which isn't bad, but it's not my preference if there is a built-in screencap system already. Another thing is camera sensitivity is taking a bit of time to figure out ... but again, that's easily fixed. I'd like to be able to fix it so that the music/in-game sounds still play when I move to a different window, because as someone who streams that's kind of a nice thing to have, but I also really like that it pauses automatically during cutscenes just so I don't miss anything, so it's kind of a weird give and take there. Another thing is that there are times when you can get stuck in the terrain, and if you haven't saved recently, you might just be a bit out of luck ... especially when you're in a dungeon instance where you can't fast travel your way out of it. \n\nOther than that, I really don't have any real complaints about the game.

After learning how rough its development was, I'm amazed it's as good as it is. I give it a thumbs up, as it has been quite fun for me in spite of many drawbacks. I'm less than half way though so far, but I think I have enough time in to share my experiences.\n\nSome specifics:\nThe lore is deep and could be interesting, but it still rather formulaic, and the delivery is awful. Collecting scraps of history scattered around the map feels like a chore. After awhile I stopped trying to talk to everyone I met as each additional NPC usually only added a tiny bite more information than any other. Fortunately everything that is important or involved in a quest or mission is very clearly marked with an icon, so you can just run through the story without exploring or thinking much if you want, but that in turn gives it a very linear feel.  \n\nThe inventory and crafting menus are a pain to navigate. In a game like this, having an inventory limit does not add a layer of strategy, it just makes picking up the loot dropped by enemies a chore. The nature of this game feels more like an old school, top down RPG in a 3D skin. As opposed to the weight limits in Fallout or Skyrim, it feels less like I need to plan my pack to travel light, rather that I need to make sure I unload all my loot before starting a new quest or going exploring, or I'll get punished for finding too many chests of loot.\nWhile I love the idea of crafting my own potions, magic gems and custom equipment, it felt more like an attempt at a mini game or padding than anything useful. Early on there isn't much I can do with these skills, and by the time I progress enough to effectively use them, I've discovered  that I can usually just find better quality loot than I can craft. Maybe by the very late game stages that will change, but so far very little I've crafted has been that useful.\n\nThe combat is probably my favorite aspect so far, the concept of having your character able to twist their fate around, you are able to mock up some rather unique combat builds. All in one encounter, I can use my stealth to sneak up on a guard and assassinate them, then cut loose with with some wild magic attacks on the rest of the group, then go full ninja, darting around with my daggers or some cool boomerang/scythe weapons, then use my secondary weapon slot to break out a big azz war hammer, all without needing to even open a menu to swap out equipment. Of course I could do that too and really broaden my arsenal, which sometimes (though rarely) may be needed if an enemy is resistant to certain attacks. The diversity or weapons and spells is really nice. Essentially it's as though my one character represents what would have been a diverse party in another RPG. I have to admit I really do like the way that plays. \nThough it is not perfect here either, the camera sometimes will end up in the worst positions, making it hard to see. And the controls (on controller at least) along with the auto-targeting assist and attack animation frames means I frequently find my character lunging into spots I REALLY don't want them in at the worst times. Still, I generally find it quite enjoyable.\n\nIn short, this is a fun, less well known game. If you like these kind of games, I think it's worth picking up on sale. OR waiting for the remaster that is supposedly in the works.

So if you are a story person, you should get some fun enjoyment.\n\nKingdoms is a vast game and promotes exploration, taking on the many side quests to level up and see all the nooks and crannies as you play, is a great way to enjoy the game. It can get repetitive and as you level and get better gear the challenge kind of falls to the way side, but the game itself is a gem that for most will stay unearthed and that\u2019s sad.\n\nThe better news is, in August the remaster is releasing, its releasing for 39$ USD so if you have never played and started only hearing about it, I would wait out to August and get the revamped version with new combat, visuals and a few other treats. This game is highly underrated and really many others should check it out, so grab it on sale or wait for the remake, either way don\u2019t pass this game up its another diamond in the rough.", "timestamp_created": 1592439083, "timestamp_updated": 1592439083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70954941": {"recommendationid": "70954941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298480072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 911, "last_played": 1595292622}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game awhile ago, and forgot about it... but recently, finally picked it up, and I'm addicted!

I have played it countless hours on xbox 360. PS3, Xbox one and on pc overall probably totalling 1000+ hours... I've never actually beaten the game though. All of the hours I have on pc are of one character doing all of the side quests and dialog in the first half of the game and the DLCs.\n\nPros: VERY LONG, Looks beautiful at times, Weapons and armor look badass, You FEEL powerful, its easy to get into character and immersed, A lot of customization on playstyle and design, plenty of weapon(even chakrams),large areas, and a fairly decent storyline, doesnt take too much space-quick loading times,\n\nCons: With how long it is it has possibility of being repetitive, It flips its difficulty a lot either you are an untouchable god or you are getting your shit rocked by 1 shot bosses tracking projectiles while he is immortal, Traveling takes a while the first time. names are forgettable (What's an \"agarth\") and finally there are 2 classes which are just leagues better than the rest which can sometimes make it hard to stray away from the usual, Oh and all the loot is completely random there are still several unique and set items I have never gotten.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games of all time and I think it is fantastic and everyone should atleast give it a try.\n\n8.8/10 is my personal rating, while I love it I do think there are better MADE games and games with better STORIES, while this game makes you feel like the badass the story makes your character out to be it is easy and characters can be forgettable at times. It also has the problems of being occasionally glitchy. the randomized loot makes sense but also bothers me because this game has a gear set mechanic and its hard to even get 3 pieces of a 5 piece set(unless you are a mage in which case a 4 piece set)\n\n7/10 for the dead kel dlc it simultaneously feels way too long and way too short, like the story feels rushed and weird but it also feels like the missions take forever to complete. besides that its fun, and gives you plenty of new powerful weapons, gear, and perks/buffs along the way. sadly you cant fast travel there after you beat it making 100%ing the area make it feel worthless to come back to after you do so (it also has several unremovable items that can enter your inventory)\n\n8/10 for the teeth of narros for implementing new mechanics, a few even cooler weapons, a beautiful area, and a decent story. This one is better paced BUT a lot of the enemies hit way too hard and the final boss is a nightmare to deal with. Its pretty good and has better dungeons than dead kel but the drastic change in difficulty that happens here is too bothersome. If it wasnt for the 1 hit enemies I would have probably given it a better rating,\n\nOverall I prefer the main game to the dlcs.", "timestamp_created": 1590541101, "timestamp_updated": 1590541101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69856807": {"recommendationid": "69856807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289373353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 12842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12820, "last_played": 1591099892}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]ENTERTAINING, HUGE BUT REPETITIVE AFTER A POINT[/h1]\n\nKingdoms of Amalur is a big RPG in terms of the number of quests, map size, NPCs and a fun game when it comes to combat with it's diverse, fluid, easy to use mechanics and layout. If there's one thing that will make a decent impression on you after you complete this game is it's combat and if there's one thing that will give you a mixed feeling about the game is it's repetitiveness. Although, I must say that only completionists might feel the latter. The main quests along with the faction/guild quests really shine and will atleast make upto atleast 60 hours of quality content but when trying to complete the huge number of side quests and tasks, is where the game tends to remind you that the world of Amalur is infact not that diverse or perhaps even boring to an extent with it's not so different caves/dungeons, not so different enemies, NPCs boring the daylights out of you with their not so different voices and after you reach max level, there are no not so different anything. Though, there is a character build reset feature available through NPCs and two really good DLCs that offer some fresh air, it might not necessarily keep you hooked all the way to complete the game in its entirety. The problem with Kingdoms of Amalur is that you reach max level mid-way to completion or atleast that's what happened in my case where i maxed out around 130hrs of my 214hr playthrough. After maxing out, the game goes stale. Thinking of it, I would say that the game can really be enjoyed if you are casual about it and not particularly a completionist. After all, it's an arcadey RPG. \n\nA break-up on how I felt about the game:     \n \n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td][b]Story[/b][/td]\n\t[td][b]8/10[/b][/td]\n\t[td]Never before heard story but it's you as always who is saving the world.

That's not to say it isn't worth anyone's time though. \n\nCharacter creation is good, but it's definitely not winning the award when you consider its writing pedigree - R.A. Salvatore is a wonderful writer and is of course very familiar with the denizens of The Forgotten Realms - so I was surprised that in a game for which he was the world-builder, the player race choices aren't as varied as I'd like - in terms of silhouette, they're all pretty much the same. Still, it's not bad for what you get, it's just not as varied as someone who is familiar with Salvatore through familiarity with DnD might expect.\n\nCharacter development on the other hand, is terrific and deserving of praise. It kind of parrots the better things about Fable's character development - you have distinct spheres of abilities to choose from and the \"class\" you get as a label for your character morphs based on what choices you're making. I was a huge fan of diving deep into the melee tree and then investing half as much into the magic tree to create a blink-stepping mage knight. You could do quite a bit - very similar to Fable with the same general spheres covered by its \"Strength, Skill, and Will\" system.\n\nCombat is fun and over time you actually get upgrades that make things feel like you've progressed - in-combat maneuvers and things that would have caused you trouble early on are much easier later. I did not think it really did anything super wild with the combat - you have pretty standard functionality with block, dodge, ranged attacks, and spells. The game really wants you to engage in melee a bit even if you're playing an archer or mage, but it gets lesser over time. One thing I will touch on is that the melee combat feels appropriately chunky and the heavier weapons feel really weighty and powerful. Additionally, fighting the very large enemies is pretty interesting.\n\nThe story is good - I still think the general premise is actually relatively unique - somewhat problematic pronunciations of Celtic mythological concepts notwithstanding - and I think it does a solid job moving you along and motivating you to play through. The sidequests are relatively standard, but you do get some cool rewards through them, like unlocking your house in some places.\n\nRPG features are hit or miss outside of the above concerning your character stats and abilities; you kind of lack agency in the story as another \"chosen one\" kind of character, and you don't really change much with your dialogue, but you do get some interesting things like housing and there is a good chunk of background myth, history, and plot to be discovered by simply running around reading books and encountering landmarks.\n\nFinally, I do think the visual style is hit-or-miss with people - it's like a slightly less stylized World of Warcraft, on the whole. Characters are big, bulky, and primary-colored. Armor sets are a little less wild in the shoulders department, but there's definitely a distinctly modern high fantasy style to all of the equipment and the colors are very saturated. I like that personally, but it's definitely not a game with a realistic-slant in terms of visuals.\n\nThe only other thing I'd comment on is that it's mostly a solo endeavor and that sometimes makes the world feel a little empty - you do encounter a lot of NPCs and sometimes have combat helpers, but it doesn't feature a robust party system for managing a crew of allies.", "timestamp_created": 1590386843, "timestamp_updated": 1590386843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69744108": {"recommendationid": "69744108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021080049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 6721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6721, "last_played": 1590341973}, "language": "english", "review": "Yep, it's worth playing, BUT better take into consideration that it can take over 100h to complete (note: I had both story expansions included). Sure, you can skip all the side quests, but I wouldn't recommend that - the lore and little stories are the best this game has to offer in the plot department. The main quest and characters are so plain and cliche I doubt I'll remember any of that after a month. \n\nThere are some side activities (crafting, lorestone collecting) and a few quests introduce some variety (e.g. there is a quest in the gnome city where you need to decipher a code), but without a doubt combat is the main activity here. And while it is satisfying, it's nothing stellar and after all this time it got rather boring. I doubt speed-running the game would help, if anything it would just rob the experience of all the other good things.

A lot.\nI started playing this game sometime in 2017~2018(?) through Origin. I ended up buying it on Steam, too, and thought I'd share my thoughts.\n\nCharacter Creation\nNow, this game has pretty decent character customization which is what I normally love and gravitate towards when looking for any Fantasy RPG. You can decide which gender to play and choose between 4 races. The hairstyles are much cooler and prettier than most hairstyles I've seen in current character creation in some games (least in my opinion and my experience). The faces and jewelry and tattoos are really awesome too, I especially love the piercings options, they're really great. So if you're someone who really loves character creation, this game has it, I gotchu.\n\nStory\nI really liked the story and all the side quests! Everything is literally and fully voice-acted and it is so nice. You'll recognize a lot of the VA's also. I've recognized many from Dragon Age among others! I love it so much because it's nice to be able to feel like you're actually there and talking to whomever you choose. Subtitles are optional as well. And the characters you meet in story and through side quests are so expressive sometimes! It's very refreshing and fun and adds so much more charm to the game. \n\nGameplay\nI cannot get enough of how good the combat feels. Literally, if you have been looking for a game with satisfying combat, and awesome finishers, you have found it. Hands down, it is so fun to play this game and fight enemies. You can dodge but cannot jump (except you are able to jump down from high ledges). My ONLY gripe is that the camera isn't great but I honestly got used to it and it doesn't affect my experience.\nNow let me explain the class division while I'm at it.\n*Classes are divided into 3 categories which have accumulated all related weapon skills(combos and awesome \"Moves\") and abilities within them:\n-Sorcery (magic weapons+skills)\n-Finesse (rogue weapons+skills)\n-Might (knight weapon+skills)\nIt's super simple to work with and you are free to apply skill/ability points to either category based on your personal preference. You are not restricted by which category/class you choose. And you are able to later reapply all skills later sometime in-game to try the other class categories. (Which you would eventually have to decide/change from trying out all the weapons as I will explain below)\nNot only that, there are nine different weapons to choose from which you are freely able to use without class restrictions. Let me break it down.\n*Nine weapons, 3 per class category, are available to use and are in no way are you restricted from using them UNLESS they require a certain amount of skill points in said-class category. (Ex. a weapon requires Level 3 Sorcery). Each weapon gets their own super cool combat animations and its so GOOD.\n>Might Weapons\n-Longswords\n-Greatswords\n-Hammers\n>Finesse Weapons\n-Longbow\n-Dual Daggers\n-Faeblades (SUPER FUN DUAL DAGGERS)\n>Sorcery Weapons\n-Staves\n-Sceptres\n-Chakrams (SUPER FUN MAGIC THING)\n\nCrafting+Inventory\nThe crafting in the game is super fun and easy! You can Sagecraft gems (that buff your weapons+armor), and craft armor+weapons(Blacksmith) and potions(Alchemy). Resources are literally everywhere and they drop pretty frequently from enemies and loot spots but never overshadow weapon+armor drops. It's really awesome and so satisfying. And your resources DON'T affect your inventory space for each one collected. All resources have their own pouches to keep in and makes it super awesome to freely collect resources while also looting for everything else. You also get to move whatever loot you find into your Junk space, making it easy as heck to immediately sell when shoppin'. \n\n\nTL;DR\nIn my opinion and from having played this game and truly loving it, I believe Kingdoms of Amalur is a really great game. I regret not buying it upon its release back in 2012.\nI highly recommend Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning and I hope my review helps some of you come to a decision!\nGood luck and have fun!", "timestamp_created": 1589843880, "timestamp_updated": 1589846158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69389166": {"recommendationid": "69389166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041669588", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1488, "last_played": 1596867758}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game, shame what happened to 38 studios", "timestamp_created": 1589839963, "timestamp_updated": 1589839963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69389048": {"recommendationid": "69389048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264704235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1589875945}, "language": "english", "review": "Old school and fun", "timestamp_created": 1589839784, "timestamp_updated": 1589839784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69366984": {"recommendationid": "69366984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198429358511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 16982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12190, "last_played": 1662036201}, "language": "english", "review": "\nPros\n\nGood Combat\n\nAmazing class combination\n\n3 DLCS\n\nCons\n\nTerrible camera\n\nTerrible Story\n\nNo end game content", "timestamp_created": 1589810624, "timestamp_updated": 1660988328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69305026": {"recommendationid": "69305026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062386470", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1313, "last_played": 1642409368}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game with incredible and unique combat and class systems.

But it is not skyrim. \n\nBefore I state whether the game was bad or good (spoilers, it was pretty meh), you must first understand that 38 studios had a pretty rough experience with the birth of the game and those troubles that the studio had does contribute to the end-result of the game. (there is a mini documentary about this on youtube but i'm pretty sure you've already seen it. if not, it's worth checking out) \n\nIt wasn't a horrible experience. After I actually started to progress through the game's story and map, it was enjoyable and fun. I remember a specific moment when I stumbled into a dark valley-like area with lots of spiderwebs and large centipede looking creatures when out of nowhere a half-woman half-spider monster appeared and scared the hell out of me. Exploration is great (albeit VERY linear), monster variety is not bad (what I wish BOTW could do better in), and the fighting mechanics are fluid and fantastic.\nBUT\nVery very soon it's easy to discover how repetitive the quests can be. Sure, the concepts and ideas for these quests are creative and great in theory, but the tasks themselves and what you do as the player behind the monitor does get bland because it is an unfortunate case of rinse and repeat. I also try not to focus on graphics too much when it comes to judging a game, but some of the facial animations (like with  a lot of games, let's be fair) aren't the most pretty or fluid.\n\nHaving played games like Skyrim really conditioned me into raising my expectations for fantasy/rpg/exploration games which lead me to be incredibly disappointed with this game.

You mage to open very hard locks or wards and it awards you with white items and basic healing potions.\n- Persuasion doesn't seem to have any repercussions for failing and you don't need to invest any points in it to still have a small chance at succeeding.\n- On the hardest difficulty, some bosses can just flat out one-shot you depending on the build.\nI find this forces you to guzzle down dozens of potions before each fight just to be effective.\n- There isn't really anything to do with all the money you collect. The game gives you tons of items so you never really need to buy anything.\n- You can very easily make Fate Potions which turns any combat into an easy one-sided massacre (even on boss fights).\n- Combat can be somewhat annoying. Enemy attacks will always fully interrupt you (unless you use the warrior ability), which will happen quite often with multiple enemies. Combined with the fact that most abilities have a slight charge up time and lock you into the animation, it is frustrating playing a build that doesn't involve you destroying everything with a large AoE meteor that can't be interrupted.\n- Armor sets don't really mean anything. They don't scale and cannot be upgraded.

Though it is built on solid enough foundations, much of its execution is dodgy.\n\nIf you're familiar with any of the Elder Scrolls, Gothic, Risen, Two Worlds, etc. template of open world ar-pee-gee then KoA isn't going to surprise you. The only thing KoA really has going for it over its cousins is its over-the-top action combat. It's actually pretty sick the scale and special effects and animations of the combat moves you can pull off - and they only get more absurdly awesome as you level up.\n\nThe rest of the combat has problems, however. Enemy movement and attack tracks you 1:1. Because of this, the game treats dodging as little more than a vague suggestion. Dodging isn't about moving sufficient distance out of the way of an attack because the hit will track you regardless. It is more about the timing of the dodge, and even then the game is often like \"LuLz naw that didn't happen.\"\n\nEnemies get to doge with impunity, however, since they always move such that they're conveniently out of your range of attack. This makes the ranged weapon types and magic a dominant strategy, the cackrum especially. Even then they can spam attacks and every hit stun locks you. This can result in groups of enemies locking you into an endless attack combo gang rape that you have no hope of getting out of. For enemy attacks with follow up hits, you WILL take the subsequent hits. You, however, get to rely on the RNG gods to stun and interrupt enemies.\n\nThis all wouldn't be so bad if you could treat combat like a sort of chess match, where taking turns defending and picking the right attack for the appropriate target made combat into a tactical affair. Alas, the game uses \"soft\" auto targeting for attacks that is waaay too hard for the finesse that combat requires. It's sometimes so bad that spells that should place enemies well within their area of effect sail right past em.\n\nThe combat isn't utterly broken, though. It's just constantly aggravating. It can be satisfying but it can also get plenty of repetitive.\n\nThe rest of the game is pretty standard fare. Run around, complete quests, get rewards, sell junk. We've played this game before.\n\nEnemy level is set to whatever region you're in. They don't level with the player at all. This might be considered a solid for people who criticize Elder Scroll's strict system of matching the player's level, but here it means that regions are gated by stronger enemies and areas you've been to are populated exclusively by enemies you can sneeze at and obliterate and receive no expee or relevant loot from.\n\nThe game does boast a ... \"unique\" presentation. Graphically its artistic style is somewhat refreshing from the norm. It's this colorful edgy fairy tale aesthetic that's a nice change from the usual gritty grimdark fantasy we're used to seeing. However, dungeon layouts are arranged like they were generated from building blocks by a logic processor with no end of reused assets. Even Skyrim's caves are more diverse than KoA's dungeons. And the overworld is this square grid of regions connected by narrow passages. It's not an organic looking world. To use my early analogy, it looks like something a logic processor assembled. Visually, however, the different areas all have their own unique aesthetic with some nifty visual touches here and there.\n\nThe story is pretty unique. It's an original enough concept penned by regarded fantasy authors including R. A. Salvatore and comes complete with its own extensive original world building. The concept and premise for Amalur is something I can get interested in. Your mileage may vary.\n\nBut there isn't much to do beyond combat and yucking it up with amalur's yokels. The dialog is awfully pedestrian and the characters largely forgetable.\n\nStealth is an absolute joke and it seems as though the designers only took stealth into account for select instances in certain quests. Even so you can just run all in sword point first anyway making stealth not so much a dominant strategy as a pointless waste of time. The problem is that enemies are programmed to either randomly wander or sit around waiting for you in such a way that they can always see you coming and there's never anything to hide behind.\n\nBy the end Amalur is left with some noteworthy if problematic combat and an original enough story and world to be compelling. It can't compare to the scale and sophistication of games like Skyrim, but it has enough of its own uniqueness and problems to offer.\n\nYou could either be intrigued and entertained - if slightly frustrated by combat woes - or painfully bored out of your skull playing Amalur.\n\nFor that, I wish I could give Amalur a simple middle of the road rating, but since Steam likes to keep things simple I'll give it a recommendation just for not being completely blinkered.", "timestamp_created": 1587008919, "timestamp_updated": 1587009767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595578312873840332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67392703": {"recommendationid": "67392703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195547390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1599701641}, "language": "english", "review": "wish they did more games like this one its so under rated", "timestamp_created": 1586985472, "timestamp_updated": 1586985472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67365547": {"recommendationid": "67365547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062455233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 5026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4915, "last_played": 1627022511}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome action RPG.

Long ago, only now am I recently finally playing it because it installed onto my steam account, which is awesome. I knew I shouldn't of expected much, in fact I expected nothing really, just a fantasy adventure rpg. The combat is the worst thing though, actually worse than most combat systems in its day with the day hitting, attacking, and lock ons work. I'm a heavy melee centric kind of person. I have a big sword, a shield, and a bow. I'm usually good to go but for some reason I feel more punished doing this over magic than anything else due to how combat is. Leveling is super slow as well and progression is very odd in this game. It's a limited free roam experience essentially iwth level zones. However instead of making sure you're a level you need to be you can enter zones far higher than your level from the looks of it. I still haven't died mind you but weapons just seemed to be tooth picks against certain creatures in the zones and nothing really gives weapon rewards.\n\nIt has fast travel so that's really nice actually, just have run everywhere to discover places form what I can tell, mind you even with 12 hours I still didn't get far (save files on different computers, putting hte game down after 2 days and picking up after a year so start overs.) My next issue are quest markers, it has them which is nice and I love it, but then you get quest markers that are \"hey bring this person these things\" okay where are they. \"Oh we're not showing you, we're just going to stay over the dude that asked for them.\" Which there are a couple of quests like this, tehy don't show you but rather show you were you got the quest. Why bother with a quest marker/tracker when it's not going to work all the time? Pair this with the progression is just pretty sluggish to get through certain parts. I think my main issue is that the leveling is tied to their freeze time ability, you get it early, you stack up a special and when you activate it it freezes time essentially and lets you attack monsters. When you complete it you can do a special interaction that'll increase exp earned by 25%-100%. My issue? I save it. This feels like a clutch ability when you need it, especially since there is zero health regen in this game and no ability to heal with.\n\nPersonally, I had a bad experience. When I finally sat down and actually played this game wiht intent to finish I just can't bring myself to because I hate this combat system, I hate the quest rewards, and I hate the leveling system. Maybe if I played with a friend it would be better, joking about the elves and the horny scaling they have for humans. Another plus was the spruce mustache I got but outside of that there was nothing really saving this game for me. THere are other fantasy rpg games out there that do much better than what this game does. I'll probably just watch a playthrough so I can at least see what the story is but man, really disappointed in it even with no expectations I was let down.\n\nA final note would be that the weapons DLC feels really waste of money. I got that when I got the game from gamestop, I think, I don't even know where I got it actually. However the armor/weapons DLC is pointless, you get a replacement for all of the stuff they give you almost immediately and you can buy better stuff right off the bat. This wouldn't of been an issue if maybe it lasted me to the 3rd zone, at least, but it's replaced so fast there's just no point in even equiping them. It's actually better to get them out fot eh starting zone city chest and sell them right away then buy better gear. It's just such a waste of actual money.", "timestamp_created": 1586920363, "timestamp_updated": 1586921602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67331121": {"recommendationid": "67331121", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983536968", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 1113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1113, "last_played": 1584232793}, "language": "english", "review": "KoA was one of those games I debated recommending or not for a fairly long time and had to go with no- not because it was a bad game but just because it was kinda too meh considering the options that are out there these days. Granted it's an 8 year old game at time of writing made by a developer that doesn't exist anymore so maybe its fair to say skip it?\n\nIf Diablo2 and Skyrim had a baby, it would be this game hands down. However, it lacks both the compulsive draw of Diablo and the immersive depth of Skyrim. Sound, animation, environments, abilities and UI (unless you have a large monitor) are all very good and there is nothing strikingly wrong with it but, after 18 hours of giving it a good shot, I'm super bored with the game. Maybe that\u2019s enough for the couple bucks I bought it for on sale but I'm only in zone 3 of, like, 20-some and have no motivation to continue seeing what's next.\n\nCombat is fine but samey, environments are pretty but lack intrigue and the story exists but is uninspired. You get easily lost in the constant string of nouns that defiantly feel like they were spit out of a fantasy name generator without thinking about player readability. I was once asked to collect some alviek root from the Geharyra cave at the far end of the Sarsanus river in the Dyssueh province and you wouldn't know which name I made up because the game throws so many in one ear, out the other words at you all the time.\n\nThe lack of readability meant I was in my quest log about as much as I was in the world trying to figure out what there was to do around me and where I actually needed to go to. Eventually I got fed up with it and just ignored quests entirely to go explore but even that was frustrating in its own right with around half the places I went to go explore into being locked until I had the appropriate quest ready to let me in\u2026\n\nSo, in conclusion, I cant say it\u2019s a bad buy if you get it for cheap. Sub $10 will get you at least 8-10 hours of exploration and enjoyment but don\u2019t expect a whole lot.

Most important parts of the game, particularly the cons, are bolded. some context: This is after beating the main story and doing a large portion, perhaps 70%, of the zone/side quests. Also, no DLC. \n\nPros:\n-Combat feels really good.  Can't quite put my finger on why specifically, for the most part. Some of the spells are quite elaborate and feel very powerful though.\n\n-The lore itself is interesting and well made. It's presented in a natural way through mediums like item descriptions, side quests and books. The worldbuilding is probably this game's strongest aspect. It's more-or-less what kept me going for so long. \n\n-The devs put in quality of life features you might not find in some games. Or at least, in 2012. \n\nCons:\n-Gear progression is messed up. After a relatively early point in the game, you don't really find a lot of gear that's better than what you have. I've heard blacksmithing gives better gear, but you don't find much as far as drops go. Not that you really need blacksmithing to have an easy time\n\n-Difficulty is generally not linked to rewards. This applies to both combat and skills. You could lockpick a very hard difficulty chest and get a minor healing potion. It provides very little incentive to go bother with chests after a certain point. The same applies for skippable enemies. \n\n-Economy is messed up. After a point, gold becomes completely irrelevant, as you have more than enough to buy whatever you need. Quest rewards also become worthless\n\n[b]-Combat is tedious[/b]. Let me preface this by saying I'm not a huge fan of this type of combat. There is little variety in the enemies you face and most of the enemies you'll fight are just generic monsters, even in higher level zones. There's a few variations, but not enough to make a huge difference. Attacks are often easy to deal with between how few are allowed on the screen at any one time and AoE attacks.\nAnother issue: The block button isn't reactive enough. I think the issue is animations can't be cancelled at all. \nThird issue: There isn't enough variety of weapons and abilities for each path. Or at least, if you play on doing a pure warrior, rogue or mage.  Especially applies earlier on in the game when you can't earn your abilities (you have few spells early). You will probably respec your abilities at some point. Not because you necessarily want to, but because you'll have tried everything offered for your preferred playstyle and grow bored.\n\n\n-Some quality of life issues are not present. I know I praised it in the pro section, but this can really hamper you. One of the biggest examples: Potions take up an inventory slot. This doesn't sound like a huge issue, right? Wrong. There are multiple versions of each potion and there are 25-ish types of potions. Most potions also drop from enemies or can be found in chests. Potions can easily account for 1/3 or half of your inventory space, depending on how many backpacks (increase your inventory by 10) you've bought .\n\n-Inventory space is small. \n\n[b]-Main story is very disappointing[/b]. The structure  is there, but nothing else. We don't spend a terribly large amount of time with any of the characters, even the main ones. You also do not have any companions/squadmates as you would in Mass Effect or Dragon Age. What these two things mean is you don't have many opportunities to interact with the main characters and even when you do, they don't have much to say. What does this mean? It means you end up not caring. Not going to go into spoilers, but a certain choice at the end of the game doesn't have a very large impact on you as a player.\n\nThe questline is also quite short for a main quest. Wouldn't be a huge issue, but there's not many quests which tie in to the main one until the end. Ultimately, the main quest feels devoid of life, lacking that \"spark\" which really makes them feel immersive and special. \n\n-Game is very grindy. The main quest moves far quite quickly.  It feels as if the devs expected you to grind through all the zones in the process. That can add up quickly. Most of my playtime is probably just zone quests. In fact, I went around doing everything in each zone I had to go through before I just said screw it and tunnel zoned the main quest. \n\n[b]-Game is buggy.[/b] Not unplayable or even disruptive most of the time, but you will notice if you play enough. My main issues (off the top of my head at least):\n * My first time, I ran into a game-breaking bug where loading my save file would cause the game to freeze. Couldn't find a solution online. I rage quit and didn't pick up the game until recently. As of this writing, my account has about 102 hours logged, but you can subtract 26 of those hours because of this\n* Undeletable/sellable items. There are some items in your inventory you simply cannot get rid of, even after their relevant quests. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that your inventory starts off sort of small \n* There is a horribly bugged questline I've discovered in the game. It's every quest in the red marches zone. According to the wiki, this quest can disable fast travel for the rest of the game at a certain point. Obviously, this is quite game-breaking. \n\nTL;DR: I've seen other people say this game is a hidden gem. I think that's very generous. The progression systems leave you with no reason to bother looting things beyond books and flavour text on epic and set items. Combat is boring and left me with no real reason to ramp up the difficulty, despite how undertuned normal difficulty was. The main story was so hollow that most of the sides questlines actually had a larger impact on me.  Amalur has the potential to be game-breakingly buggy. If it's not, you'll still notice the bugs. \n\nKingdoms of Amalur starts out strong, but you eventually notice all its problems. If you have *a lot* of free time and low expectations, I'd say Amalur is a good buy. But for everyone else, this is a waste of time. Instead, check out just about any other RPG. Perhaps Jade Empire or any of the other old-bioware games.\n\nEdit: \nI have now completed the Teeth of Naros expansion. Now THAT is what I'd call a \"hidden gem\" in this dunghill of a game. It doesn't solve any of Amalur's problems. But the story was well written, the characters were enjoyable to interact with (especially secandra) and the city of Idylla was fun to explore. If you're like me and played the base game fully first, you should be at the point where gear and levels are irrelevant. You just have to stomach the annoyance that is combat.

It has been narrated quite well through the main quest with much lore but understandable and not too irritating.\n- The possibilities regarding to the play style are plenty. You can mix the classes a bit and the skill system is pretty neat. You have to be an epic idiot to set the skills completely wrong.\n- The visual style of the game is okay. Mostly a little bit too colourful for my liking but okay. Some of the greater showplaces have been designed and staged very well.\n- I really liked the fighting system. If the enemies wouldn't have been complete blockheads most of the time it could have unfolded its whole potential. It's easy to learn but if you want to be more dynamic and dodge the enemy attacks with style it can be a bit challenging. Nice.\n\nCONS:\n- When you do every quest and also play the DLCs you reach the max. level of 40 quite fast. And with the right equipment and skills nothing is a challenge anymore, especially late game. It was by far too easy. On my final run I mainly specialized in magic skills with equipment which pushed my element damage to new heights and at the final area I only had to flock the enemies together to dash in a meteor or a lightning pillar to erase all of them at once, even on hard mode. Became a bit boring.\n- The world is really big...a bit too big at some points. I really love huge game worlds but Amalur was just very rambling sometimes with huge areas where you can't find something interesting anyway. The exploring aspect of the game is very disappointing. There are several chests and hidden loot places but the loot mostly isn't worth the search. Exploring the small corners of the world isn't very rewarding in my opinion.\n- The loot is horrible most of the times. When I open a chest after a very hard dispel I don't want to expect a single common alchemy ingredient. And that happened too often even in the late areas.\n- Most of the side quests are terribly uninspired. 90% of them follow the old \"Go to this place, get this thing/kill this dude, come back\" - pattern without a nice backstory like straight from a subprime MMORPG. And there were too many of them.\n\nAltogether the game is quite good. The story is nice, the skill- and fighting system is pretty exciting and it aged well in my opinion. The visual style is okay.

This game does have some missteps, believe me. I find the pure-RNG loot system to be atrocious  for playing my character exactly how I want to as well as ruining the fashion side of things, I strongly dislike how crafted gear at mid-game is miles better than most of the 'legendary' equivalents (Unique gear and Set armor) you find in the world, and at end game makes the game downright brain dead on hard. Crafting making the game trivial is then doubled down on due to the lack of both a 'Very Hard' mode and NG+ to give the enemies a boost once your character is leveled, geared, and specced how you want them to be.\n\nDespite all of that however, I still think this game is better than Skyrim (released a year earlier) and at least on par with Dragon's Dogma (which came out 3 months after Reckoning). One of my biggest gripes with RPGs where you create the character is that I always feel like I'm forced to play the way the Devs wanted me to, through class systems, or there's too much freedom and the only limits on a character's abilities are self-imposed. Reckoning allows you to become a Jack of all Trades, stopping you from becoming a master in all, but also giving you different bonuses based on the \"class\" you are.\n\nEverytime you level up, you get three skill points you can spend in three skill trees; Might, Finesse, and Sorcery. These three skill trees of course correspond to the typical three classes Warrior, Rogue, and Wizard. However you are allowed to spend these points how you will, and your allocation of points determines your \"Destiny\", this game's equivalent of a class. You can play a pure finesse character, and receive bonuses related to all the weaponry, armor, and skills relating to that tree from the related Destiny. Or you could play a finesse/might character, which locks away your access to some of the highest tier skills in both trees, but allows you to take advantage of different skills and passives from both, and have a Destiny with bonuses relating to those two trees.\n\nCombining this excellent skill system with the different weapon moves you unlock along the way allows combat to feel extremely dynamic, and rewards thinking about what order you use skills, dodges, and weapon attacks. I cannot get over how rewarding the combat in this game feels. Of course, this comes back to the main drawback; this game becomes trivial, and there aren't really any enemies who will force you to think on your toes. From the poor area leveling system which leads to you easily overleveling, to the fact that you can use healing potions and even open up your menu to chug other buffs while performing other actions or while being staggered means that if you die while playing this game, you probably weren't paying attention at all.\n\nWhen you are in a leveled zone, and you are fighting relatively difficult enemies, this game can be very fun. Even without that, I think that playing with the different abilities and Destinies has quite a bit of potential. Nothing in the game really pushes you all that hard, sadly. I'm going to recommend Reckoning based on its extremely enjoyable combat and character building, but be ready to be disappointed in the lack of an NG+ to help bump the difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1586420987, "timestamp_updated": 1586420987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66883977": {"recommendationid": "66883977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062857971", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9598, "last_played": 1587303122}, "language": "english", "review": "Though nothing about this game really stands out that much, it is in every way a good RPG.

That's what I'd rate this, a solid \"meh\". (Sorry, Ellen.)  Going to hit thumbs-down just because the current \"Very Positive\" is somewhat overrated.\n\nIt's a perfectly serviceable game, but it's not pulling me in like Skyrim or Oblivion did. My complaints are mostly nit-picks, but there are a lot of them. The keyboard bindings are awkward. A controller feels much better, but is a poor choice for a mage build, as you can only have four spells mapped to buttons.  The only way to cast others is to go into the menu, map them to a button, cast, then back to the menu to return to the first mapping.  You *can* use the keyboard in conjunction with a controller and select spells that way, but it's not reliable. Any touch of the controller disables the keyboard. The next key pressed re-enables it, but that key is not taken as a command. So you have a spell in slot 5. Press '5' to activate it. But really, that only activated keyboard mode. You have to press '5' again to select the spell, then right-click to cast it. Bump the controller in between and you're back in controller mode so the right-click isn't accepted.\n\nWhen combat works, it's good. Fire a spell, dodge one blow, block another, finish off the monster with your weapon. It feels cinematic and bad-ass.  When it works.  Ranged abilities are auto-targeted, and the game usually picks the nearest enemy. So you have an enemy advancing from the front that you try to shoot, but another one standing to the side is slightly closer so the auto-targeting whips around to them instead. One of the mage spells lets you mark a number of enemies then ignite all marked enemies into flame. Only marking them is a ranged ability, and you'll often end up marking the same one repeatedly because it's a little bit closer to you than the others.\n\nYou can only jump from specific platforms. You can dive head-first into the Grand Canyon, roll, and come out running if someone's put a platform on the edge.  But if there's no platform you can't jump down from a knee-high ledge. Or even step over a fallen branch. I got ambushed by some bandits on a knee-high patio and couldn't get away because the steps were on the other side of them. I was trapped and unable to drop from the dizzying height of 2 feet. Oh, if only someone had thought to put a platform there!\n\nSide quests. Oh my god, there are side quests! Yo, dawg, I heard you like questing so I put a quest in your quest so you can quest while you quest! Kindoms of Amalur: The Side-Questening. Side quests are great, but this just seems to take them to ridiculous levels. They're like a hydra. You can't complete one side-quest without acquiring two more.\n\nFactions. Join a faction, see the world. Or don't. Or join all the factions. Whatever. Apart from giving you more side quests, affiliation with a faction doesn't seem to have any effect on your standing with other factions or with NPCs.\n\nNPCs tolerate straight-up murder. I was on a faction side quest where I was supposed to return a deserter to his barracks. I found him drinking in a tavern. I failed my persuasion check and he attacks. Murder-mage that I am I zap him and burn him and leave his charred, smoking corpse in the corner of the bar. No one else bats an eye at any of this. Another quest had me returning some items to the leader of a bandit gang. I acquire the items and head to his hideout. The gang members attack so I kill all of them. Get to the leader. \"Thank you, adventurer! Good job! How about you come work for me?\" Dude, I just murdered your ENTIRE GANG. \"Welp, can't leave any witnesses, so if you won't join me, me and my gang will just kill you here.\"  Um, yeah, good luck with that.\n\nIt's not a *bad* game.

It's third person and the action and combat is more fluid and it's more of an action game than Skyrim, more action than exploration.

Must-play for fantasy RPG fans!\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and very fitting. The resolution of the models feels quite high as well and the game is from 2012.\n\nThe controls are very intuitive after a little getting used to the combat system. And if you are not satisfied with them, you can adjust them in the seetings. The one thing that bugs me a little is that you can't jump, but this is by far not the only game that has this \"issue\". The combat system is simple, you have health and mana and can cast magic at the cost of mana. For those who are more the fighters, there are eight different types of weapons to choose from. Depending on your play-style, you can skill up differently, which allows you to only wear certain types of armor that fit your style.\nTo the story elements:\nThe main story line seems to have not too many quests, at least that's my feeling, but I started the game almost two years ago, so I might have forgotten how many main quest there were. However, while traveling the lands, you find an insane amount of side quests and objectives. These add so much lore into the game and apart from the quests, you have a hell lot of people to whom you can talk for even more addtional information. So great job with the quests and the lore of the game.\n\nApart from all the very good stuff, there is one issue, though: \nThe studio that created the game doesn't exist anymore, so any bugs that are still in the game will most definitely never be fixed. The bugs are mostly cosmetic, but after a while one bug is very annoying: Items that were required for a quest that is now completed sometimes can't be removed from the inventory. So over time, you stack up items in your inventory that you can't sell. These items do NOT count towards your inventory item limit, so it basically doesn't affect the gameplay, it is just annoying. There is a way to get rid of these bugged quest items, though, that involves manually editing the save file.\n\nSo for everybody who enjoys fantasy RPGs and can ignore the few cosmetic bugs, this is definitely a brilliant game that takes up a lot of time to complete with 100%. \n\nHave fun ;)", "timestamp_created": 1585936939, "timestamp_updated": 1585936939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66509685": {"recommendationid": "66509685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258174649", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1763, "last_played": 1585924902}, "language": "english", "review": "Combat is great!

I think I bought this maybe a year or so ago, probably the winter sale of 2018. \n\nI was really eager to see what all the fuss was about. The most consistent thing I've heard about this game is that its a gem that's often overlooked or forgotten.\n\nWell, I'm here to say that in my personal opinion, this game doesn't deserve anymore recognition than it already received.\n\nHere's the gist of my points for the sake of brevity:\n\n-This game is painstakingly easy. The \"Learning Curve\" is more like a straight line.\n-Both the loot and the sidequests themselves are largely forgettable (Quantity over Quality). I found myself struggling at finding any interest in any of the main characters, the lore or the locales.\n-While the freedom to shift around playstyles was a very nice idea, the lack of class balancing overall becomes very apparent the further in game you go. This is especially true if you end up Blacksmithing everything for yourself.\n-The lack of variety in the brain dead AI (They almost never block)\n-The art style in general is unimpressive. I know this game is dated to 2012, and had to compete within like a week or so of Skyrim, but this looks like a mashed mess of DA:O, Oblivion, and the cartoony style of WoW\n\nI'm sure I could keep going, but I won't. Instead I'll end the review with what was, for me, the actual dealbreaker.\n\nThis game's leveling system is so pants on head stupid that it hurts. I may be forgetting a minor detail or two, but it basically functions like this:\n\nWhenever you enter a new area for the VERY FIRST TIME the game will look at your level, then set every mob and quest to that level FOR THE REST OF THE GAME. The also extends to dungeons, but only when you go inside the actual dungeon and not the surrounding area it is part of. \n\nSo what does that mean? Well for starters it means that enemies in the zone will eventually become gray (underleveled) even if you are not finished with the area. In turn this means that quest rewards and drops you find quickly become meaningless. It also means that you end up overpowering the last 1/2 or 1/3 of an area. It also means that area will be meaningless later in the game. So even if you wanted to come back later to finish the sidequests you skipped so you wouldnt over level, you can't.\n\nIt's so bad that there are actual guides to prevent over leveling (I kid you not, go google it)\n\nIn short, this is a very average game, and while some people may have nostalgic attachment to it, it's in my own personal opinion that it's by no means underrated, and in fact is overrated by some of the comments. \n\nIf you wanna buy it, ONLY BUY ON SALE.", "timestamp_created": 1585710535, "timestamp_updated": 1585710701, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494414389133453369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66304984": {"recommendationid": "66304984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073087250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5314, "last_played": 1585060598}, "language": "english", "review": "Ticks most every box for a third person rpg.

I finally managed to play through the main story. Kingdoms of Amalur begins with a unqiue twist early at the start. However over time the main story following up to all the mystery begins to become a lot less interesting. \n  The main story itself may cast a small shadow over itself, however the lore/world side quests can sometime have a interesting enough story there. Which really helps make Amalur a more interesting world to explore. Time is another huge factor in this game.  you can easily spend over a hundred hours playing this and exploring this game if you so choose to. I personally decided a more direct route. focusing on mostly just the guild quests and the main story. That can be accomplished easily will little issues. \n  The difficulty and scaling doesn't really seem to be properly finished. When you enter a new region, the game will scale the enemies and loot mostly to your level. Even on hard difficulty the game just feels too easy. I'm no designer but i'm just guessing that the loot is a little OP. That doesn't detract all the fun however with the gameplay. The loot is always exciting to find and the movement and combos that you can dish out to enemies in the fighting sequences feels great. The loot looks fantastic!.\nThe Art in this game is amazing, the world looks fantastic. The music is really good and changes up nicely through most of the game. Leveling is another major piece to this game, if you've played some of the elder scroll games you will find some similarity from a much more simpler design here. it's really fun mixing around with plenty of options offered for you to explore and experiment.\nIn all I don't HIGHLY recommend Amalur but I do think if you got an open world fantasy itch Amalur can potentially be a good option for you to have a deep dive with.", "timestamp_created": 1585611699, "timestamp_updated": 1585611699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570400834083557129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66201409": {"recommendationid": "66201409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194566026", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1841, "last_played": 1590084005}, "language": "english", "review": "Great open-world rpg game with a lot of alternatives.

Is this game perfect? Absolutely not. But I would still say it is a must buy for any lover of anything RPG. Obviously everyone fawns over the combat in the game so I'll skip that.\n\nThe main story's premise is really cool, your character died (don't know how) has been brought back to life (also don't know how) And you've been resurrected with some new special powers that are fun to use in combat. But the real kicker is that because you've been brought back to life, you now no longer have a \u201cfate\u201d or \u201cdestiny.\u201d Meaning you have achieved true \u201cfree will.\u201d This is a super cool concept for a story especially since it means you can actually change the fate of others, since you have non of your own. Having said all that, I felt like the execution of this sweet idea was awful. I don't feel like we got to see this type of power play out to it's full extent. The whole point of being \u201cfate-less\u201d is that you are unpredictable. Buuuuut pretty much everything that happens turns out to be very predictable.\n\nMain story I give a 6/10 I would have probably given it a 8 or even 9/10 but I mean no matter how unique and original your idea is, if you don't do anything with it, then it was meaningless.\n\nThe Legend of Dead Kel DLC is a solid expansion. I don't think they do anything crazy with the story, I was expecting some plot twist the way they were leading you, but nothing big is revealed. But the characters are fairly memorable for me, and the villain is \u201cvillainess\u201d enough? It is pirate themed if that wasn't obvious, which I'm not a big fan of, but that's me. The castle you get in this expansion though was fantastic! I loved upgrading it and doing all of the small and big side quests and tasks associated with it. I wish more RPG's had upgradable homes, castle, keeps, forts etc. It was nailed in this DLC in my opinion.\n\nTeeth of Naros DLC was BOMBASTIC! By far the better DLC between the two, and frankly I enjoyed it so much more than the main story too. You have a LOT of original ideas and cool plots and fascinating races, mainly the Kollossae. (pronounced Col-los-i) Tall, stone skinned, but flesh and blood inside, humanoids. They have a strong mix of Greek/Egyptian aesthetic to them, and I LOVE IT! There is a lot more I'm dying to say about this DLC but I'll just end with it's beautiful and you should definitely play this, even if you don't play the other DLC or can't finish the main story. At least play Teeth of Naros.\n\nMy overall score for the entire game would be a 7.5/10 with an award of \u201cMust Buy\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1585446254, "timestamp_updated": 1585446254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65995137": {"recommendationid": "65995137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198863334029", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3039, "last_played": 1585383825}, "language": "english", "review": "Underrated RPG with fun combat mechanics, one of the best i've played for years.

And despite that I can only give it the most marginal of thumbs up. From a dollars per hour stand point this may be the value of the century and yet Amalur has a lot of issues that hold it back. \n\nAmalur is an over-the-shoulder action RPG in contrast to the isometric ones ie. Torchlight and Diablo. It focuses less on huge numbers of enemies like those games but you can still tackle many foes at once unlike most MMORPGs. It has very robust skill trees which fall into the classic 3 archetypes; Mage, Warrior, and Rogue. It rewards multiclassing by providing extra perks for having multiple point in different areas, and this makes any build viable.\n\nAnd I mean that literally, anything will probably work in this game because it is quite easy. Even on Hard mode very little will challenge you save for 2-3 sections in the entire game. It may be the biggest fault of the game is you are going to get very used to using the same abilities for every combat. Enemies become a speed bump not a challenge as you navigate the absolutely massive world. I do mean massive, this game takes a long time to complete, even if you're just dogging it for the main quest line. But is it a game that's an inch deep and a mile wide like so many open world games? Not exactly. There are a ton of quests, and every word of dialogue is voice acted here. What a feat that must have been. Now this takes a page out of oblivion by having maybe 10 voice actors for the whole game, but at least it is quality voice acting, even if every second person sounds alike. And yet the quests do seem hollow. I eventually stopped reading the text and just started chasing pips on a minimap to get the quests done. \nThe biggest tragedy in Amalur is what a near miss it is. Technically it runs well, the colors are vibrant, the monsters are well animated (but around a third of the way through you'll have seen every monster, they get palate swapped after that), but it it's borrowed so much from other RPGs it has nothing unique about it. \n\nBut I still finished it, and as a relaxing RPG it fills that niche quite well.

Honestly, you'd have a better experience than I did if you went and listen to the OST and downloaded some awesome HD wallpapers of the environments.\n\n\nPROS\n\t* Environments (and the scope of them - the caves near the Codex of Destiny, jesus...) are absolutely mindblowing. Top 5 game environments\n\t* Top-tier fantasy music - very well themed and relaxing\n\t* Cinematic moments while exploring are really cool - monsters coming out of hiding spots and having them highlighted, or jumping from ledges changes up the flow of exploration nicely\n\n\nMEH\n\t* Though the basic combat loop is pretty fun and moderately skill-based, the way that the talents work to bolster weapon strategies means that you're almost immediately forced into using one type of weapon in the first few levels, and then for the rest of the game\n\t* Experience gain seems to be really imbalanced due to the fact that 99% of your XP comes from combat, but it is a very story- and dialogue-heavy game\n\t\t* Ideally I'd smooth this out by adding more logic / puzzle based, or reading quests, similar to the quests inside the city where you have to talk to others to get info from them & make decisions based on that\n\n\nCONS\n\t* The itemization complaint area\n\t\t* Item gain curve is ATROCIOUS. I'm not necessarily looking for Borderlands-style \"new gear every encounter\", but I had the same helm for my mage Selkie Veil for the first 17 hours of play because it was too good\n\t\t* Flat stat boosts are absurdly good for the first 40hrs of the game (until I quit), vs the % boosts that are often on items. I had 3 armor cloth gloves on for 15+ hours because it gave +20 Health and Mana, which was ~35+ of my base stats for that entire time\n\t\t* Items you gain are pretty much random item level, and 99.9% on the low side, so it's a vendor trash collect-a-thon. There are very few meaningful decisions when upgrading items\n\t\t* Unique items (Epics and Set Items) are completely random in drop rate. This may vary depending on certain key chests looted (e.g. the first mercenary stronghold leader's chest having the 6% exp ring), but out in the wild / dungeons / caves everything is random, as per a reloaded save has proved. The game design theory may be that a player would think \"oh wow, I discovered a random Epic or Set Piece, super cool!\", but since it is incredibly likely that the item is going to be hugely underleveled for your character, as well as not the right build (a might item for your finesse character, etc), that picking up a super rare item is just another uninteresting event.\n\t\t* Set item bonuses are nearly worthless, and doubly so when considering that the base items usually have next to no stats\n\t\t* Set items are vastly inferior to Epic items in terms of stats, which hurts Set items even more because you need 2 to 4 of them to enable the set bonus for them to be viable\n\t\t* Blacksmithing is WAY WAY too crucial. I was able to craft a pair of gloves with +65 Health & Mana on them (as well as shittons of other stats...) that couldn't be replaced for tens of hours. it also makes items that are vastly superior to any Epic or Set item.\n\t\t* Armor just doesn't look cool at all. Changing armor should at least give a visual changeup, but they all look almost exactly the same\n\t\t\t* Melee weapons are pretty cool, especially 2h swords and maces\n\t* Though Discover Hidden is pretty cool, having no mechanics or ingenuity used to discover these on your own without tons of points dumped into the DS skill isn't very fun\n\t\t* This leads to things like hidden doors or insanely hidden chests ending up as more frustrating Minimap-based discoveries at the end of the Discover Hidden skill tree rather than natural finds based on world design\n\t* Persuasion is almost worthless in a game functional sense, and truly worthless in an RPG sense. A couple of dialogue choices per hour, and even then it's just convincing the questgiver to let you keep the item they had you retrieve\n\t* \"Shielding\" in combat is pointless, and the shield item basically serves as a stat stick - the combat actions you perform that take the entire animation to resolve (spell casting in particular) can't be short-circuited by shielding, nor dodging, so dodging is by far the best solution to preventing negative combat outcomes in every situation\n\t* There are tons of books to read, but they only serve as character background or insights into world lore. They don't even grant new quests, open up new dialogue options, etc. Huge missed opportunity\n\t* Inventory management is constantly necessary and unrelenting. Throwing tons of loot at someone (most of which either has uses around selling or blacksmithing) and then punishing them for actually picking it up in a dungeon isn't fun at all\n\t* Lockpicking (a skill which is also worthless) is Elder Scrolls-esque, in that you have to position the lockpick in a range. Unforunately the range is smaller than any other game, so you start to understand the possible ranges an unlock segment can exist in, making every lock a trial and error issue that only takes one lockpick\n\t\t* Also lockpicks are unlimited, so there's no risk in failing\n\t* Spell damage does not scale with anything other than spell skill rank. This is great for power spikes while initially leveling the skill early and feeling like a hugely important decision, but as you progress through the game, monsters start to become massive damage sponges with no give & take, which makes it seem like your last N amount of hours was for absolutely nothing besides acquiring a new ability\n\t* Leveling slows down MASSIVELY ~20 hours in at approx level 20. Compounding this fact with the Spell Damage increase point above, this makes the game transition into a grind 1/3rd of the way through it's own story\n\t* Gold gaining methods become pointless ~15hrs into the game, and there are basically no 'gold dumps' of any meaningful significance, so it's just another pointless number going upwards\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1584198692, "timestamp_updated": 1584198692, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65017009": {"recommendationid": "65017009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004043157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2663, "last_played": 1514628166}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly an amazing game", "timestamp_created": 1584183480, "timestamp_updated": 1584183480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64990796": {"recommendationid": "64990796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072622992", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1662, "last_played": 1595381937}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend.

If you play it you probably want to do two things first:\n\n1. Get Widescreen Fixer or something similar to adjust the camera location. The art is gorgeous and you won't see it on default settings. \n\n2. The inventory is bugged, so you'll end up with boatloads of stuff you can't get rid of. It's not a cheat, but a necessity to raise the max storage to 1,000 items or so. \n\nLets get some of the basic cliches out of the way:\n\n- Color coded loot\n- Animals drop inappropriate items like pants and gold. \n- Incredibly easy to pull enemies from a group, an in fact it's so bugged it's a cheat. Very often after pulling a certain distance they'll ignore you completely, so just feel free to fire away. \n\nOf the genre, what this game does well is the close up combat and action sequences, but it's like college: You get what you put in.  I don't mean you can invest in armor and weapons, but that it's kind of hard to fail. If you want up close action death scenes you have to avoid pulling and bugging the NPCs to irrational behavior.  Jump in and slash or burn away. \n\nThe crafting is easy and grind free. You get a skill point per level, and yo  may choose to allocate this to crafting. Before you infest a alot of time into black smithing you want to find a crafting guide, as the mechanics here are unique. You can re-craft components to build them up. For instance, you make a sword, with a gem, and then salvage it, over and over until you get the right rivets you want. That sort of thing requires patience to learn and do well. \n\nOf the crafting skills, I never found potion making important, you won't be able to get rid of them fast enough. Gem and black smithing is where you want to invest in. Not only will you be able to do more repairs with repair kits, but making your own armor and weapons (including sorcery gear) is actually as good or better than loot. \n\nThe lore is also, well, tedious. It's all very wordy, and very elaborate, signifying nothing. At first you think the Fae are hot and you'd like to have a Fae harem, but soon you realize how much they talk. On and on and on.

derramar horas como un condenado.\n\nPROS:\n-Historia entretenida, no es la gran cosa, pero est\u00e1 bien.\n-Jugabilidad bastante buena, no he tenido ning\u00fan problema en ning\u00fan momento.\n-Gr\u00e1ficos digeribles y aceptables a d\u00eda de hoy, que ya es decir para juegos de la \u00e9poca de este, aparte hay mods que mejoran un poco las texturas y los acabados, aconsejo echarles un vistazo.\n-Un montonazo de misiones secundarias y secretos por descubrir, si lo que te gusta es completar todo lo posible, este juego te va a dar horas y horas, aunque si vas del tir\u00f3n a por la historia, tiene una duraci\u00f3n equilibrada para que no te parezca poco ni se te haga bola, as\u00ed que tiene para todos los gustos.\n-2 DLCs/expansiones (los cuales no he podido probar a\u00fan, pero me gustar\u00eda hacerlo) con muy buenas puntuaciones, lo que significa que si te ha gustado el juego base, vas a tener contenido extra, eso si, pasando por caja, pero si los pillas en oferta pueden salir bastante baratos.\n-Personalizaci\u00f3n del personaje bastante decente incluso a d\u00eda de hoy.\n\nCONTRAS:\n-Me he visto obligado a jug\u00e1rmelo en ingl\u00e9s, ya que en espa\u00f1ol carece de di\u00e1logos ni siquiera en ingl\u00e9s y se buguea de forma que no te deja continuar hasta que no lo cambias al ingl\u00e9s en algunos puntos (sin ir m\u00e1s lejos, la primera vez que me ocurri\u00f3 fue saliendo del lugar de inicio, en un di\u00e1logo con un enano)*, en mi caso no he tenido problemas a la hora de jug\u00e1rmelo en ingl\u00e9s, as\u00ed que para m\u00ed no ha resultado ser tan molesto, pero entiendo que para otros puede llegar a un punto clave.\n\n*He de decir que esto ha sido en mi caso, puede que a otra gente no le haya pasado, tampoco es que me haya preocupado por investigar, pero por si acaso pod\u00e9is hacerlo ustedes.\n\nCONCLUSI\u00d3N:\nRecomiendo totalmente su compra si eres fan del g\u00e9nero, tiene ya bastantes a\u00f1os, pero si no te importan los gr\u00e1ficos, vas a disfrutar de un gran juego, a ver si hay suerte y THQ Nordic nos trae una nueva entrega en el futuro, ya que compraron los derechos a 38 Studios

Which is sad, because it sounded like an amazing game from most of the reviews. I was excited to play it. This lasted...I don't know if it even lasted minutes. I think I knew from the opening cinematic?

From the other reviews I've read (even the positive ones) this pattern was going to repeat until eventually I won the game. \n\nIf other games didn't exist I would recommend this one because I believe it's technically a game.

If you want to play this, then get the remake.]\n\n[Hour 10]\nEllen was right.\n\nI'll be damned. I'd been hearing about this game that I had no idea it existed back when it came out. I was up til 3am on my weekend for the first time in a hella fortnight because I'm enjoying this game /that/ much.\n\nThis is the fable game we should have had a long time ago. Combat and level up feels like the Fable games but evolved into something so much more thoughtful and fun to buy into while the rest of the game feels a bit like a bioware RPG. You don't get the full Mass Effect RP experience, but you get close. It feels more like KotOR than anything else. You don't need to ask every NPC their opinion on EVERYTHING, but sometimes you get fun little rewards.\n\nThe game shows its age sometimes. Big packs of enemies can dangerously juggle you a bit. The camera in dialogue sometimes pisses off somewhere else bot a line or two, nothing huge.\n\nFable had three experience paths, Amalur has three varied and adjustable skill trees. Mixing the trees earns you 'classes' that eventually alter your character. For example the finesse/sorcery hero can turn his or her dodge roll into a snazzy evasive Blink teleport. Much later levels add a poison effect.\n\nSummary-\nLooking for a western RPG singleplayer game? Come take a peek at KoA:R. Look past the 'not bad but not good' voice acting. Enjoy the colorful stylized environments, the original story, and the solo Build-a-Murder-Hobo style of gameplay. You don't get a billion  choices, but you do get a good handful to tinker with as you please. This game's only real crime is getting released right around the time Skyrim came out ensuring no one was playing it instead because we were all still eating butterfly wings and trying to find the dark brotherhood.\n\nThanks OX Team, for letting Ellen stand on that soapbox for so long about this game.", "timestamp_created": 1583261191, "timestamp_updated": 1608183491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64440409": {"recommendationid": "64440409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053650713", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 13389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2744, "last_played": 1599379875}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my all time favorite games", "timestamp_created": 1583215845, "timestamp_updated": 1583215845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64439720": {"recommendationid": "64439720", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977160929", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 9393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8481, "last_played": 1586819589}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun Game, Good Graphics with interesting special effects and challenging without being overly so.

They do the job and are quite nice changing from area to area. The only problem is the camera which seems determined to give you a colonoscopy.\n\nCOMBAT\nCombat is mediocre. Does the job but nothing special. Once you kill enough enemies you can go into reckoning mode which makes you superman for a bit. Enemies tend to come in groups and at times they can be frustrating when no matter how well you dodge or block an enemy stun locks you.\nFriendly NPCs are useless in combat as they don't do more damage than a wet fart.\nAlso , enemies are fairly repetitive. They are all unique but it won't be long till you've seen all. DLC adds a few but they are not that interesting and some feel like reskins.\n\nSTORY\nInteresting fantasy world with some lore and thought behind it. Some factions (house of Sorrows) have decent stories. Only a few of the characters stand out though the rest seem rather generic. With other RPGs i played , the NPCs tended to be more memorable and have a bit more personality.\n\nFinal thoughts\nA bit grindy but a big world to run around and have fun in. OK-ish story to keep you engaged and some stuff to do on the sides (crafting , alchemy , stealing etc). Overall I had fun with it. \nIt is a fairly consistent game - as in it is predictable. No matter the area i was in I expected to get a quest , kill some mobs, get a reward. A good and bad thing. Bad because nothing jumps out. Good because you know what to expect.\nFinal boss was a bit underwhelming - the DLC boss from Teeth of Naros was much better.\nGiven the age of this game I recommend getting it on sale if you don't mind games with some repetitive gameplay but a big sandbox to play in.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1582837956, "timestamp_updated": 1582837956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574178218841552734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64200418": {"recommendationid": "64200418", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999597603", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 3153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3085, "last_played": 1685284401}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome RPG, one of a kind.

Combat isn't quite as deep as games like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, but it still manages to have surprising depth, entertaining combos, and a quality mix of abilities that add just the right amount of spice. The story is neat, but the game is very much more about the world and your character's place in it rather than having a phenomenal central narrative. \n\nThe game can be quite easy though, with side quests regularly overleveling the player, money being unnecessarily easy, and skills allowing you to get quality gear the moment you acquire a single piece of the newer tier of equipment. I highly recommend installing and configuring the\n[url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Kingdoms_of_Amalur:_Reckoning#YSA_Heartcore_Mod] YSA Heartcore mod [/url], which reduces exp gain, player damage output, money gain, etc. whilst raising enemy damage output and generally balancing the game to be a fair bit more challenging. If you are at all familiar with combat systems like Dark Souls, God of War, DMC, Bayonetta, or even Kingdom Hearts 2, I cannot understate how much I'd recommend installing this. If you're familiar with the Fallout/Elder Scrolls series and their economies, regularly breaking them and acquiring mass quantities of cash, then definitely install it at least for the gold rebalance.\n\nAt the end of the day, this game is absolutely worth a playthrough or two, but maybe not for full price at the moment. The DLCs greatly add to the experience, giving new areas, NPC races to interact with, stories to enjoy, etc. and they recently raised the price of the whole game package (from around $35 to $53), which is a bit shit, but oh well.

Is not a master piece, but is a good game, maybe even great game, that is worth playing at least once IMO.\n\nThe strong points of this game are, \n1. replayability (several weapons to use and many things to try, many \"builds\" options), \n2. Environments, they are beautiful. And the world is huge.\n3. World building and setting. in the sense of the lore and background,  \n4. Game mechanics and combat. Combat is fun and enjoyable (but see below in the \"weakness\" part for a caveat.) \n5. (See below, point 1) Some of the few characters that have \"characterization\" are great. The sad part is that they can probably be counted with one hand only.\n\nThe weak parts are, IMO\n1. Characters in general: there are not many characters that stand out (but those that do, are good IMO.) In general, there are just too little of character development and there's just a few instances of characters that are well developed enough that you will grow attached to them, like other games have.\n2. Combat is a bit too repetitive. It never bothered me too much the first times I played through it, but this last time since I made a complete playthrough in Hard for the achievements, I had to overcome the tediousness of fighting some enemies (there are many \"statbags\" with oodles of HP) and the limited selection of enemy move sets... combat gauntlets are normally repeated setups of the same enemy types over and over. Also, there are some enemies that are totally obnoxious to fight and you often have to fight them in hordes.\n3. Main quest is good, and many of the side quests are good but not all of them, and the bulk of them are completely forgettable IMO. This is part of the \"character\" problem I mentioned above, and the fact that most side-quests are just fedex type of exchanges and there aren't many options or conversations to engage, either with the quest givers or other characters that you have to interact with for completing them.\n4. There aren't enough options/choices that matter, and in fact, I'd say that AFAICR there are none.\n\nAlso, in a separate topic from the pro/con section, I'd say that most people would say this game is too easy, and that would be a con for them... I kinda don't consider that a con myself, as someone that often wants to just turn the brain off and enjoy some gameplay with not much hassle... but yeah, it is a bit too easy, even in Hard. Thing is, the game becomes tedious in Hard, not \"Hard\". Still, there are other games for scratching the \"hard\" itch for me, and this one is one of those you want for scratching the \"want to play a badass character in a cool fantasy world and forget about our crappy real world\" itch, and it manages it quite well :)\n\nDuring this last playthrough on Hard there were some things I disliked combat-wise about the game, that I only realized now... but I'm still not sure they are important enough to mention here... it certainly has its flaws and quirks, but I don't think they can take you out of the game, so to speak.\n\nOverall, IMO it's a 7.5 game, maybe even an 8 one, depending on taste and other subjective measures.", "timestamp_created": 1582689474, "timestamp_updated": 1582689474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565885722637176514", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64124511": {"recommendationid": "64124511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400533723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 3060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2226, "last_played": 1637392463}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not just good.

I lost track of time playing this. \n\nNow the bad: way too much running around, backtracking through dungeons is very tedious after you've cleared  them. There's no mark/recall like in TES games, and not all the dungeons are designed with a quick exit afterwards. I found the constant running around to the same place multiple times kind of annoying, especailly after having just done a quest there, or missing something. The side-quests are severe overkill, there's hundreds and each is like \"hey help me do xyz\" and it gets very redundant, to the point I just skip all the dialogue to hurry it up,  There are also some MAJOR bugs, not the least was I had the best set item in the game for a mage and a bugged quest literally made it disappear from inventory to get replaced with the quest helm, I no way to recover it. By the time I noticed it was gone my option was either reload a game from hours back or just say F it and keep going.   Another bugged quest forced me to reload too which cost me 40 minutes of redoing things. So... save often don't just rely on auto save.\n\nI give this game a 65% positive rating because of all that.

Fortunately, the pros outweighed the cons so I couldn't let myself give a bad review. In general, KOA is an 'okay' action RPG that failed to live up to its potentials.\nThe pros: \n+ Fantastic combat and perks system. The ability and moves are very unique and diverse. Players are urged to utilize all kinds of powers and character builds/fates, from sorcerer, warrior to assassin build. Chain attacks/combos and magic are super cool, fun and easy to learn. In comparison to Witcher or TES, KOA is on another level with regard to varieties of magical spells. \n+ QTEs (in fate mode) are exceptionally well-done compared to other games. Implementing QTEs as finishing moves is not a new thing in video game, but the way KOA executed the mechanics is effective and satisfying.\n+ Incredibly well-written and original lore.\n+ There are diversity and indescribably beauty in the world of KOA. Despite its outdated visuals, the game still looks fantastic at times due to the uniqueness of its world design.\n+ The map is vast, packed with contents. To specific, I have completed around 110 quests, from primary, secondary, miscellaneous to guild quests - I haven't yet uncover half the map and I still discover more quests from NPCs. It's a good thing if you're looking for a huge sandbox experience to invest your time in. On the other hand, there is a big downside to this  which I'll get to in a moment.\n+ Gears and equipment, such as armors and weapons are cool-looking and super badass. You can equip full gears to get extra stats or mix and match to fit your play styles.\n\nNow, about the cons:\n+ Quest design is terrible. This game is more about quantity instead of quality. The main story is shallow and generic (you will find yourself difficult to care at all), side quests are basically story-less chores and fetch tasks, and guild quests are poorly written and confusing.\n+ Despite being an open world game, there are lots of invisible walls so you'll end up using long way to move around. And worst of all, you cannot jump.\n+ Graphics are outdated. The camera angle is terrible. Bugs occasionally appear and sometimes game-breaking. Despite being released in 2012, It feels and plays like a 2007 game.\n+ The voice-acting is mediocre and robotic. Although the lore are interesting and unique, the voice-acting (with the combination of poor facial animations)  is not captivating enough for players to actually follow or invest their emotions in.\n\nOverall rate: 6/10 - this could have been greater and big enough to get a sequel.

Kingdoms of Amalur has certain... pretensions. It thinks its combat is far more engaging than it is, so it gives you far too many enemies to fight; it thinks its writing is much more compelling than it is, so it inundates you with dialog. None of that is really a deal-breaker: these are common problems with open-world RPGs, as much as we might wish otherwise. What is the dealbreaker? The quest design is excruciatingly dull.

And even so, they get stale from the midgame onwards. The combat consists of combos with various weapons, giving you control over how to approach groups of enemies, while the class system allows mixing three skill-trees: Might (melee warrior with heavy armor), Finesse (archer/thief with light armor) and Sorcery (mage, with access to staves, sceptres and chakrams). When mixing them, you build your own playstyle and get rewarded with bonus stats and abilities (e.g. a Might/Sorcery build can replace dodge with a teleport function, improving mobility).\u00a0\n\nNow for my major complaints:\n\n[b]Terrible map design[/b]. Every open area and dungeon is composed of extensive winding corridors. That wouldn't have been so bad if they were shorter or if we could traverse them using any type of mounting. As it is, you'll spend half the game running around, you might even have to replace your Shift and W keys after a playthrough.\n\n[b]Over-leveling[/b]. Too many quests, too much EXP. Regions are level-locked, so it's easy to level up above the region level and make the rest of the game boring. Worse even, there's a time in the main story where you have to choose which main quest to pursue, separated into two different regions. If you follow one and do some sidequests, you can become too OP to enjoy the other region when you're forced to go there. Basically, 1/5 of the game is made obsolete in any given playthrough because of that quest design.\n\nEvery other aspect of the game is just average.

If you stop to appreciate the details, it really does feel as if the whole word is alive and interconnected. From the stories told by NPCs, to the books you can read, to the way the dungeons and world is laid out. It feels as if more thought has been put into this than most western RPGs.\nI would also like to praise the skills system.

Story wasn't really a strong point here and the questing reflects it. You'll encounter generic fantasy hero fluff with mostly interesting main quests and a few decently interesting faction quests. Side questing can best be described as mindless filler and I skipped the majority of it. \n\nIt features an awesome combat system with some real weight to it though. You can expect each weapon to offer a unique combat style and it comes fully equipped with elemental affinities and status effects to boot. Classes can be tailored to specification so it's possible to swing a big sword and cast lightning to your hearts content. Big plus in my book.\n\nI really enjoyed the environments as well. I found the various zones visually appealing and very vibrant with decent texturing given its age. I was rarely left bored while exploring as each new area felt refreshing to traverse. There was plenty of loot to be found around the world too. I should mention that crafting felt a bit hit and miss to me personally with bloated inventory as a result of components and no decent sorting method to filter with. \n\nTo wrap things up, KOA has both strong and weak points that are balanced fairly well as a whole.

When it came out, it was by no means a bad game. In fact, it was innovative in a few ways, with Destiny being the main thing. You are not 'forced' into playing any one particular way, and the closest thing to a class system ensures there is an option for everything under the sun.\n\nThat being said, just because you CAN do everything doesn't mean you SHOULD. For one, equipment is not optimized to support the Destiny System. There are no True Hybrid armors, something is Might (Your typical strength/warrior build) Finesse (typical agility/rogue) or Sorcery (intelligence/wizard build) You CAN mix and match but you have very little incentive to do so (aside from certain catch-all skills like Hardy Constitution, Conservative Casting and Inoculation, however rare Poison is) Mixed Destinies are far worse than focusing except in niche cases (Basically any Might Destiny is good, but why play Might when Sage can just obliterate 1/2 of it's enemies with a Tempest and Meteor?) Combat is clunky at times (a tree roots itself in the ground and suddenly a METEOR is doing about as much damage as a Longsword swing by the world's smallest man, meanwhile the Fateless One will get interrupted by the slightest breeze which gets irritating after three enemies)\n\nThere are very few glitches, but when they happen, you will most certainly feel it. I am unable to complete the Traveler quest line due to being unable to talk to an important NPC who is unreachable. Killing him, leaving the area, exiting and re-entering the area, nothing works, so I'm just stuck in this part. You cannot play anything higher than 1980/1080 or else the menus will break (specifically, Quests won't show properly, and Destinies don't show up) and there are a considerable amount of Quest Items I am unable to remove from my inventory (at least 30 slots are just permanently unavailable due to poor flagging of quest completion) and there will never be a future patch as 38 Studios filed for bankruptcy long ago.\n\nIf you're here, you either have it and are debating the Remaster (It's not worth [i]another[/i] 40$) or are here when you should be on the Re-reckoning Page (Seriously, go buy the Remaster if you are thinking about it, this version of the game is [b]dead.[/b])", "timestamp_created": 1578333462, "timestamp_updated": 1630909708, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476377934217453003", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61414296": {"recommendationid": "61414296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102489182", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1531242158}, "language": "english", "review": "I finished this game on xbox360 when it first came out.

I saw it discounted on Steam and thought I would replay on here. This is the second game I own on Steam (the first being The Forest) so I am not used to the controls compared to Xbox but I found you quickly get used to all the buttons and can look rather professional when killing enemies.\n\nThe Game now... \n\nThe World: \nThis game is beautiful. It has vibrant colours and a great style. It is very open and you can go off and wander rather than following a quest line if you wish. This game is individual in itself but gathers great elements of open world action adventure games.\n\nCharacter options: \nYou can play as one of four races and have some control over appearance; not as much as 'The Elder Scrolls Skyrim' but still enough you feel the character is yours. There are various presets you can choose and then you may change hair colour styles and tattoos. \n\nYou can choose to be 'good' or ''bad'. You can join thieves or go around stealing from houses/pickpocketing. You can join a proud group of warriors for hire and choose communication options that follow different results. \n\nFactions:\nAs mentioned above you can join factions, for example, Travelers or Warsworn.\n\nResolution Glitch: When playing on a high resolution I found that the games 'Quests' section did not show any writing but this was rectified by dropping the resolution which meant I lost about an inch on each side of the vertical screen and was not detrimental to game play experience. I googled this glitch and found the way to solve it online and was reassured that I was not the only one it happened to. \n\nPlot: \nThe main missions are very interesting and send you on a mysterious adventure. I have not completed the game even on the XBox because it is so big and I am currently at 29 hours of gameplay on Steam and still have much to do.\n\nThe side missions are many and can immerse you in hours of gameplay. There are various different biome styles to explore in the Kingdoms of Amalur from the spider infested Webwood, trolls of Haxhi, the beautiful Cradle of Summer or desert areas.\n\nThe NPCs offer alot of information so if you are not a fan of this it can be avoided or skipped (it depends how much of the lore you want to learn). As you explore the world you discover lorestones that help with the history of the world with some amusing records.\n\nWeapons and Armour:\nThe game offers a wide variety of weapons and armour which are colour coded so you know if you have a rare item that you might want to stash. Purple is unique, blue is rare and green/white are more common (green less so that white). You can easily see how strong a weapon is and whether it gives specific attack damage. \n\nSome of the DLC offers a cross over armour from Mass Effect which looks good.\n\nThere are some great weapon attacks and I specifically like using chakrams, staffs and magic but you can choose to use daggers, swords or hammers too.\n\nPossible spoilers in the next bit - Games it is similar to:\nWhen you meet a mysterious female character that you don't remember, it reminds me of 'Dungeon Siege III' briefly, while some of the sword action reminds you of 'Devil May Cry' or 'Bayonetta' with spam clicking a button for entering the special finish moves. Its animation reminds me of 'Fable II' and 'Fable III' in some places and possibly 'Darksiders' but has the vibrant colours of 'Ori' and 'Fable: The Journey' or maybe even 'Hungry Shark'. On the XBox it was a good looking game but on Steam, with the added resolution options you get from computer games, it really is even more beautiful. It sometimes reminds me of 'Zelda: Ocarina of Time' because of the various areas of the world going from Forest to Desert etc. You can blacksmith, make potions and join factions like in 'Skyrim'. It basically has some of my favourite things brought together from other similar games to make a new unique and beautiful game. If you like this style of animation and enjoy RPG, open world action adventures then this game is great.\n\nSome Controls:\nMouse to position sight and direction of facing \nWASD as usual\nShift for Block\nCtrl for run\nF for interacting\nBlock and Attack with a Staff at the same time releases a cool move to keep enemies together and deal damage.", "timestamp_created": 1578076018, "timestamp_updated": 1578076018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61222342": {"recommendationid": "61222342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267966525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1583708775}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended by Ellen and her word is true!

The gameplay feels like if you took the tight combat of fable and made a full on RPG of it.\n\nA neat feature in this game is how the class/ability system is handled, allowing you to mix and match classes as you see fit. Want to blast lightening at your enemies while wielding a massive greatsword? Go ahead. Sneaky spellblade assassin? Knock yourself out. However, I'd suggest just sticking with the classic mage, warrior or rouge initially, and then respeccing once you have a decently large pool of skill points, lest your spread yourself too thin.\n\nThe selection of playable races is sadly disappointing, just two human races and two elf races, none of which are particularly interesting or unique from eachother. Similarly, character creation, while servicable, is also lacking in any form of fine tuning, and only allows you to pick a preset face and change a few other things.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is pretty decent and allows a good amount of customisation when it comes to combat, and the world is chock full of content.

I have played as every class (warrior, mage, archer/stealth) and mixtures of the three. Although I was excited for this game before its release, Kingdoms of Amalur released in February 2012, mere months after Skyrim. I'd spent hundreds of hours in Skyrim by that point and loved it to pieces. I figured Kingdoms of Amalur would be a disappointment in comparison.\n\nOther than being action RPGs, the two games aren't really comparable. I love Kingdoms of Amalur, but its issues are deep and teeter on the edge of game-breaking sometimes. This is the only game 38 Studios published before their bankruptcy kerfuffle. As a debut game, Kingdoms is fantastic, yet it also bears a lot of flaws that seasoned development teams often conquer in subsequent games.\n\nIn Kingdoms, you play as a character who died and is brought back to life. The story branches out from there, touching upon themes having to do heavily with fate, unraveling it, destinies, and so forth. To be honest, even though I've beaten the game multiple times, I have little memory of the story. It is forgettable, and as a person who doesn't believe in fate/destiny, it's simply uninteresting. Kingdoms has a problem with forgettable stories, lore, and characters. I saw another review comparing it to an MMO, and the comparison is fair. I'm someone who goes into an RPG hoping to get obsessed with lore; in Skyrim, for example, I keep libraries of in-game texts and I actually read them. Here? I tried, and I just can't get into it. Historical events, people, and wars are vaguely explained and low on detail, forcing you to only stick to the present. Nearly all NPCs in the game are lackluster. When I come across an NPC who manages to spark my interest, it surprises me.\n\nSo why in the world do I like this game enough to keep coming back? The gorgeous, unique fantasy world and ridiculously fun combat. Kingdoms of Amalur isn't the best-looking graphically; the character designs are often hideous (clunky animations in facial expressions often lead to unintentionally hilarious or creepy conversations), and if you walk closely to anything you might start to see its flaws. But on the whole, they did a fabulous job of creating a world that feels enormous despite its straightforward map-to-map pathways, and the locations are gorgeous. From gigantic forests where the trees assault the skies to rolling plains to the canyons of a desert, this game is a feast for the eyes and the world is simply fun to explore. Never before have I experienced a fantasy game like this that feels whimsical without being innocent (the enemy designs can sometimes be eerie, and blood spills frequently in combat). Amalur feels unique in this aspect; the world is so gorgeous and colorful that a lot of times I'll feel like playing just to look at it.\n\nAs for the combat, it's ridiculously easy. But you will look and feel like a badass no matter how you play. My least favorite play style was as a two-handed weapon warrior, because combat is slow and leaves you vulnerable to the ramming attacks of low-level enemies like wolves, brownies, etc. Still, the combat was fluid and beautiful. My favorite way to play is with faeblades and chakrams; seriously, at least try using chakrams once. These weapons are gorgeous, elementally-imbued, and sweep through enemies and the environment alike to where nothing can touch you. Even on hard difficulty, this game is a cakewalk. But at least it's a ton of fun as you play.\n\nA few other tidbits: the quests and enemies are unfortunately low on variety. Even when you join the Travelers (a thieves' guild, essentially), you'll find yourself completing clear-out-a-dungeon-and-kill-a-boss type quests rather than stealing more often than not. It seems like the developers tried to emulate other games with factions (like Elder Scrolls) but just did it poorly; Amalur has varied factions, of which you can join them all, but their questlines are lackluster and all start to mimic one another. Enemy designs are pathetically few and far between; you might make it to a new area and think, \"Oh! I'll start facing new enemies now!\" Ehh, unlikely. Going from the forests to the deserts only netted me a few new elven enemy types; all the creature enemies stayed the same. And if you're heading toward a climax battle and think you'll get a unique enemy type, I have bad news for you: 9 times out of 10, it'll just be a human/elf who calls themselves a special name, and they won't be harder to beat than anyone else.\n\nKingdoms of Amalur also suffers from weird glitches and game-breaking bugs, one of which happened to me while playing the Dead Kel quests from the DLC on Steam. There's a mission where you have to run out of a collapsing cavern. I did so just to find my companion was stuck behind the rubble. There was no fast travel or way off the beach, so I reloaded just to come across the same thing. Lo and behold, the only way to fix the glitch was to restart the quest. The only other save I had was an autosave, so I lost 40 hours of gameplay progress. Basically, always keep at least two saves: one where you're in a safe place, and another for more recent gameplay. Amalur's glitches are rarely foreseeable, so you'll need a save when you least expect it.\n\nAll in all, I really like this game, but I want to love it. I wish 38 Studios had survived past Amalur and went on to grow from this experience, because underneath all the grime of rookie mistakes and uninteresting lore, there's a great game here. For a debut game, Amalur is an amazing effort. Had 38 Studios learned from its flaws and went on to create a sequel, I honestly could see their games going head-to-head with the Elder Scrolls installments and other mainstay RPGs. Unfortunately, their bankruptcy lost them this perfect opportunity, but we will always have Amalur. It's unique, it's troubled, it's sometimes frustrating, yet always beautiful. I'd give Kingdoms of Amalur a 6.5/10. At its best, it's higher; at its worst, it would be lower. Either way, it shouldn't be missed.", "timestamp_created": 1577588987, "timestamp_updated": 1577588987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820995211601257324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60795032": {"recommendationid": "60795032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345826769", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1999, "last_played": 1681694369}, "language": "spanish", "review": "este fue uno de los demos que mas me envisiaron en mi pobresa durante los ultimos a\u00f1os de ps3 y cuando al fin lo consegui fue una pasada, es bellisimo lastima que las posibilidades una saga se murieran con el estudio maldito EA destructor de empresas brillantes (el problema es mas complejo que eso)", "timestamp_created": 1577580978, "timestamp_updated": 1577580978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60761757": {"recommendationid": "60761757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069123746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1232, "last_played": 1577718514}, "language": "english", "review": "best rpg", "timestamp_created": 1577548647, "timestamp_updated": 1577548647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60752977": {"recommendationid": "60752977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070715026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1164, "last_played": 1581954784}, "language": "english", "review": "I just love it.

They used the bloom and lightning very well. Some dungeons are very beautiful. Texture is ok until everything zoom in (dialog for example). This is a 2012 game so I'm ok for what it is. Would be perfect if this game has some kind of DOF.\n\nStory wise, eh it is just a classic random dude are destinied to become the hero, defeat the dark lord and save the world. I haven't finished the main story yet but for now it is good enough to keep me playing.\n\nGameplay. Oh boi here we go. The combat is quite fun actually. There are many type of weapons and they have different moves as well. You will unlock more moves as you leveling up in each class (Might-Warrior/Finesse-Rogue/Sorcery-Mage). At first, I intented to play rough style but later on I got to the hybrid rough mage style and mostly mage. Why? Let me explain.\nThe combat is literally stun lock hell. A single hit from smallest trash mobs will stun you and interrupt your current action. Enemies mostly come with a group and they tend to swarm you. Your attack animation are slow, clunky, and guess what, once you press a button to do any action, you are locked and you can't dodge. This become very annoying when you are attacking one enemy, some other dudes attack you from other direction and you can't dodge because the your animations lock you from dodging. Same thing when you are trying to do a charge attack. This is why I lean toward the Mage style. 2 reasons, spell and chakram. Mage's spells are very powerful. They can deal with multiple enemies and they deal shit tons of damage. You can just keep a distance and cast spells, easy game. About chakram, they are one of mage weapons. You throw them at enemies and they can hit multiple enemies as well. The best part about this weapons is your attack animations is fast, fast enough so you can hit your enemies before they hit them. Once used chakrams it is hard to go back to any other weapons (except bows).\nTo \"balance\" the stun lock hell system, normal mobs don't hit very hard and using any potion are instant so you can instantly heal and keep fighting no problem. Things only get more interesting when you fight big enemies like golems or giants.\nThere is a special meter called \"Fate\". Killing enemies will refill this meter. You can active this Fate ability to slow time and deal much, much more damage. During Fate, you can beat enemies to near death, pick one near death enemies. A prompt will show up and you can quickly tap space to gain more exp from this enemy. Other nearby near death enemies will die after this. Note that Fate will end right after you kill one enemy so try to bring as much enemies to near death as possible. \nInventory spacing is very frustrating as you have a very limited space and you won't get a stash early game. This will interrupt game flow because more often then not you will just finish one or two quest and then fast travel back to shop to sell/dismantle your loot.

While there isn't anything wildly unique or groundbreaking about Kingdoms of Amalur, it's the execution of some simple game design choice that make this game worth at least a try.\n\nAmalur would draw natural comparisons to western RPGs that came out around the same time, most notably Skyrim. But the things that appeal to me about a game like Skyrim are very different from what is appealing about Amalur. Skyrim's largest appeal is the world itself, the sense of immersive adventure, of discovery. That the combat, quests, and plot are merely o.k. is covered over by the fact that the world is so compelling to be in. If you didn't buy into Skyrim's world as immersive, you probably wouldn't really enjoy the game as a whole.\n\nI would contend that the world in Amalur is far less immersive, but that isn't the game's selling point. There are some impressive visuals: wide-ranging vistas abound and there are lush colors everywhere. But while there is a lot to see in the landscape, there isn't a lot to do, per se. The game won't let you fall off a cliff, but it also won't let you climb one either. There is no exploring to find another route around; no, what the map says are the outlines are what they are, and I spend as much time just looking at my map than I do the world itself. And while the world has the obligatory biomes (forest, desert, grasslands, swamp, etc), they don't bleed into one another at all in continuous gameplay. You'll be in the dense forest, walk up to a break in the hills, watch a loading screen, and poof, you're in the arid desert. In a game like Skyrim I would rarely use fast-travel because the world itself was just compelling to explore between objectives. In Amalur, I use fast-travel constantly because there's just not much to explore.\n\nSo I wouldn't recommend Amalur to someone looking for a compelling world to explore. But it's the combat and character building that make this game a blast. I've played the game mostly as a mage, so I couldn't comment on all the combat mechanics, but suffice to say that the combat is what sets this game apart. Played entirely from a third person perspective, combat is all about different moves and combos that your character will learn and develop. The animations are all quite flashy, and the more complex/powerful your moves get, the more over-the-top, almost comic-book style the animations get. Which is pretty cool if you're into that sort of thing. And that is where the appeal of the character building comes in. Most RPG have become more and more action-genre oriented, so you're character grows mainly by what sort of equipment or weapons they can use. In Amalur, the main joy in leveling up is not just seeing your stats get bigger but in increasing the variety and effectiveness of combat moves you can perform. In other words, increasing what you can actually witness your character DO. (Although skills like sneaking, persuasion, alchemy, etc are all present in the game, and do play a role depending on your character, I would argue that Amalur doesn't implement these skills any better than many other games. Although there's nothing wrong with that, I'm guessing that if someone didn't find Amalur's combat enjoyable, they're not going to enjoy the game terribly much as a whole.)\n\nAnd I'll admit, the combat mechanics are not always perfect. In certain situations when you have enemies on every side, the camera will pan back to view the whole area. But then it becomes confusing to aim your attacks, as you can't seem to tell which way you're turned. (So I'd have enemies swarming in from three sides and for some reason I keep throwing lighting blasts off into nowhere.) But this was a rare occurrence, especially after just a little bit of practice.\n\nThe story in Amalur is alright; I never felt like I'm part of some epic tale, but I never thought it was corny either. There are a few, mildly interesting twists on some of the standard fantasy-genre tropes, but nothing to write home about, or that change the gameplay any. Although the further into the game, the more I find that I actually DO want to know where this story ends up. There is a fairly limited number of enemy types, and it does seem a bit odd that almost every enemy in the game can be found in every biome (the same spiders in the swamps are the same ones in the desert...hmmm). Voice acting is actually pretty decent, although the dialogue isn't anything memorable. I felt that some of the NPCs COULD have been memorable if utilized better. But there are only 3-4 NPCs that actually continue with you through the storyline, and you interact with them very little in the grand scheme of things. You'll play for 10 hours between meeting with certain ones, and you'll think \"oh, right, you're in this game...\" There is a lot to do in this game in terms of quests. I haven't looked up any sort of quest-count, but it just seems that there are tons and tons of side quest, faction plot lines, and so forth. And you really can't tell if this go-fetch-item quest is a one-and-done deal, or if it will turn into the next five hours of plot for you to follow.\n\nSo, overall, Kingdoms of Amalur is a lot of fun due to watching your character get stronger, learn new moves and abilities, and become a whole lot cooler to control during a fight. I would describe the game as the more simple, arcade-like of the western RPGs, not one that rests on an immersive environment or writing. For that reason, I would recommend the game to at least try out. If you find you like the combat and skills systems, then that will cover over the fact that the game's other elements are merely o.k., and you'll get many hours of fun out of this.", "timestamp_created": 1576301659, "timestamp_updated": 1576301788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59749006": {"recommendationid": "59749006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013535971", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1611, "last_played": 1679295930}, "language": "english", "review": "I\u2019m a huge fan of this game as it\u2019s Elder Scrolls meet\u2019s Fable.

It was notable for its expansive world & sheer volume of in game lore, editing character skills on the fly and gigantic quest list. It received mostly good, however flopped commercially.\n\nThe story is fairly involved, with you being dropped into the thick of things at the beginning. You play as an amnesic character who has been revived, and might help turn the tide against an immortal enemy. Before the process can be applied to others or the research notes shared, the lab is destroyed and the inventor goes into hiding. It\u2019s up to you to speak to the worlds inhabitants to glean what is happening. A war has started between a subset of the winter court (immortal Fae that are reborn into new bodies when they die but typically relive the same events in their lives) and the mortal races (humans, gnomes and the more typical fantasy elves). All mortal races can have their fates read by fate weavers, but recently the results have all been the same -killed by the Fae. When the player character is found out to not only have an unreadable fate, but be able to change fate itself a plan is set in motion to discover their past and try and put an end to the war.\n\nGameplay is mixture of running through the world killing enemies or performing tasks, and clearing each area of quests. The world is split into different regions which prevent returning to them once you leave, however all main story missions need to be completed before you can move on. There are tons of quests in this game, and they can have you traveling all over the map collecting resources, slaying mobs or delivering items for minimal xp gains. Most times the quest log will be filled to the brim, and each area requires a few passes to finish all the quests if you don\u2019t outright skip them. Each area has a set enemy level strength, they don\u2019t scale with you, so progressing is more regulated by how quickly you level up. There are factions who have long chaining quests, and branching choices which leads to different fixed buffs for the rewards. These can be ignored, but the bonuses are worth it.\n\nThe player character levels up by investing upgrades into 3 skill trees -fighter, mage and rouge. Each focuses on a different style of combat, and the game recommends you experiment as the passive bonuses for each upgrade are quite good. KoAR\u2019s system allows you to do this effortlessly by allowing you to respec on the fly, and as long as you haven\u2019t started a quests you are free to changes your skills as needed. While it\u2019s likely that you will max most of the skills trees by the end of the game, it\u2019s good to be able to change how you play whenever you want, and was way ahead of its time. Power creep is a problem, as the difficulty doesn\u2019t increase with your character level, so by end game if you have been busy the enemies are a cakewalk, even on the highest difficulty. There is a ton of loot to collect, and a good crafting system as well.\n\nI found the environments and textures looked good and didn\u2019t have any issues with them. While they weren\u2019t the best quality for what was released at the time (it was originally designed to be a mmo and converted to single player RPG) the environments were large, and there was always plenty to do and fight. Each of the environments were diverse, and many had layers to them, making you explore for secrets. It might hurt your eyes now to play as it hasn\u2019t aged well, but it was more than serviceable at the time.\n\nThe DLC that were released are all separate side stories that lead to better loot and new enemies to fight. Each of the new environments was distinctive, and fairly unique.

I knew this going in, but I got the game as part of a bundle and decided to give it a try.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game is how generic the setting feels. Maybe it gets better if you tough it out, but the lore is so dull and shoved so fully in your face that it's hard to just ignore it. Nothing about the returned-from-the-dead protagonist setup or any of the characters I met made me want to play more. So, I started trying to get something out of the gameplay.\n\nThe big hook for Kingdom's gameplay is your ability to customize your character abilities. You've got access to 3 ability trees: Might (Fighter skills), Sorcery (Wizard skills), and Finesse (Rogue skills). In practice, this means you get to select exactly the sort of skills you'd imagine from each of these trees and combine them. \n\nAlongside your ability system are the weapons you can use in combat. Each weapon is effectively a movelist/function. You can switch weapons at any time, but doing so is so stilted and janky that you're better off picking 1 weapon per encounter and just using it throughout. The weapons tend to combine far easier with your abilities, allowing you to break up an attack string with an ability before resuming your attack string. Blocking is a matter of either holding a shield while moving really slowly (doing nothing, forever the least useful and fun option), or dodge-rolling.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong; I haven't encountered any bugs or other issues in execution. Kingdoms is a competently put together game. It's just uninspired on seemingly every level, and the combat is so stiff it seems like it'd play better as a top-down action RPG with a lot less emphasis on story or character interactions. Like Torchlight.\n\nBasically, I'd play this if action RPGs didn't exist, and I was trapped alone with this game on a desert island.\n\nOne final point: I got bored, as you may've guessed, and quickly discovered that you can kill NPCs when I tried stealing an item in a place called Shieldring Keep (inspired name, no?). Out of curiosity, I decided to see how far I could take the killing, and proceeded to slaughter every NPC in the keep (including the keep's quest-giver!). I know other RPGs have done this kind of thing, and I didn't find it to be much fun (thus why I'm not playing anymore), but it's a consideration psychos and serious role-players might find interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1575868571, "timestamp_updated": 1575868571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4873923659324646", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59540302": {"recommendationid": "59540302", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977240877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1294, "last_played": 1579273112}, "language": "english", "review": "Great overlooked RPG.

I have about 60 hours on one playthrough and that is with mainly doing a couple faction questlines, the main story, and one DLC. Hardly any side quests because they have a very MMO repetitive feel to them.\nThere is a ton of lore, a pretty good crafting system, and a dang interesting story. The decisions you make feel impactful and there is a lot of small details that may go missed if you dont pay attention.  A TON OF DIALOGUE. \nThe combat is super fun and probably my favorite part of the game besides the great rpg elements. However, this is also where the biggest problems show that I find VERY  annoying.  Firstly the game is very easy, mostly towards the end of the game. I had to nerf myself to present any sort of challenge. I played on hard after the first few levels because it was such a joke. Im a terrible gamer so I know its a game issue. But on the other hand I have never played a game with a stun lock problem like this one. You often fight several enemies, and any damage will stun you if you dont block it. Fine, but it breaks up the combat so bad it becomes annoying, mostly facing ranged enemies because mages spells track to such an extent it is literally impossible to dodge them, so you have to block the spell and they SPAM them. Making it so you are constantly either blocking or on the ground. But even on hard the attacks hardly hurt you toward the end of the  game, they just knock you down over and over. Its a shame because otherwise it feels great, very god of war like. Slower weapons are also worthless because of the issue because by the time you swing a heavy weapon you are being hit again and get stunned! \nI still recommend the game, just play it on hard and play around with different classes and learn to block perfectly to avoid getting stunned as much.", "timestamp_created": 1575528270, "timestamp_updated": 1575528270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59257353": {"recommendationid": "59257353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125056679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1577240891}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

I got it the same day as FFVII during a sale because I had encountered one or two loud voices who sung the game's praises. It doesn't look impressive nor can it promise a life-altering adventure that changes how you think about video games forever. What it CAN promise you is a fun 50-100 hours of hack and slash goodness with the always cathartic, if a bit predictable reward of looting and dungeon crawling.\n\nThe game is mind-numbingly easy on normal difficulty, but I don't think that's all in all a bad thing. In fact, I think the game's \"Screw it, be what you want to be\" attitude fits the difficulty nicely. No matter if you want to be a sneak-archer-mage or a full on offensive spellsword juggernaut, you'll always feel like a bad son of a gun exploring a world that is surprisingly rich and large. The crafting systems are well made and interesting, though making your own armor quickly outpaces the actual loot you ever get, even if you manage to get an entire special armor set. \n\nThe writing isn't superb or entirely terrible in any particular place, and it seems content in doing its job and little else. This isn't meant to betray the effort that went into creating the world or characters or quests, which is also very apparent, but it isn't going to win any prizes for storytelling. It exists to set a time, place, and reason for your aforementioned Mean SOG to kill some baddies without being distracting.\n\nThe number one word to describe this game is FUN.

Again, it isn't bad, but it's kind of long winded and not very engaging in my opinion. \n\nThe whole thing kind of feels like an MMO that you play offline by yourself, which isn't too surprising to me since the idea they had was to make an MMO based in this world that they'd created, and it seems like they used a lot of those same design principles in this single player game, which falls flat for me. It's a shame because I really wanted to like the game as it does have some cool stuff going for it, but the lack of a challenge and mediocre storyline give me no reason to keep going. Every so often for a couple years after the game released I looked for some difficulty mods to make things a bit more interesting but could never find any that would make it worth playing. I haven't looked in a while so maybe those exist now, but the common consensus for a long time was to manually gimp yourself in game, which is a horrible solution. I want to feel like all my best laid plans are helping me overcome the challenges that the game poses, not like I have to handicap myself to get any kind of enjoyment out of the experience. If you can find a mod to make the game challenging, it would probably be a really great experience, but otherwise, if you're someone who likes to feel like you have to be good at a game to survive--especially if you're a fan of the souls games or other unforgiving RPGs, you'll probably feel like I do and get bored quickly.

It gets such a bad rap because it's the game that sunk a studio and got Curt Schilling in so much trouble.

The game itself has an interesting history, involving a star baseball player, poor business decisions, a famous author, bankruptcy and so on. The game itself is more or less an Elder Scrolls clone. It is a large scale open world fantasy action RPG. Yeah no commas. It's all those things with no short pause in between.  The graphics are very nice for a game that launched on XBox 360, and still holds up to many current day games. Music is decent, although I'm not a connoisseur of video game music. There is a leveling and ability system that is fairly well implemented as well. The story is ok. You are The Fateless One (read: Chosen One), the only person to be able to escape the bonds of fate. The world is being threatened by a rogue splinter of a race of magical beings known as Fae, and it is up to you to stop their evil machinations. For me, the best two aspects of the game are its gameplay, and it's deep lore. The combat is fast paced, with dodging, blocking, and intuitively mapped special moves and abilities. If this were measured up against an Elder Scrolls game, Kingdoms of Amalur would crush it in this category. The game was meant to be the first in a series, and to build a captivating world, 38 Studios hired famous fantasy author R.A. Salvatore to create the game's lore, dialogue and characters. He did an excellent job fleshing out the world and lore, except the 38 Studios went bankrupt and there won't be any sequels to build on his creation.\nAs for negatives, the quests get to be particularly monotonous. Most are fetch type quests, and the game holds your hand and tells you exactly where to go at all times via map markers. You could just skip all the dialogue by mashing the skip button and then follow the arrows, never bothering to learn what to do or figure anything out for yourself. The game is fully voice acted, but not particularly well. Some actors are actually good, but others try to do a Scottish accent, or maybe it's Irish I don't know except that it sounds corny. By the end of the game things get a bit tedious also. It's a pretty long game if you include side quests, and there isn't enough variation in the gameplay formula to keep my interest for as long as it is. One more thing, I like puzzles in these types of games and there weren't any. Overall Kingdoms of Amalur is still a pretty solid title.", "timestamp_created": 1574248243, "timestamp_updated": 1574248243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57517474": {"recommendationid": "57517474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031994050", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1586366828}, "language": "english", "review": "dope ass combat + cool story = lit rpg game", "timestamp_created": 1574236505, "timestamp_updated": 1574236505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57507797": {"recommendationid": "57507797", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974928804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1191, "last_played": 1574218617}, "language": "english", "review": "It's actually more fun than Skyrim, the gameplay and UI is much better and less cluttered and less clunky than Skyrim.

Classes come in 3 archetypes (Mage, Warrior, and Rogue), HOWEVER, these classes can be mixed for in a myriad of combinations, and you equip cards called \"Destinies\" which buff your choices. \nFor example, say you want to do ALL 3 of them combined. SO you disperse your skills into all 3 skill trees. By doing so, you can choose the \"Universalist\" Destiny. This card or destiny,  gives you buffs accordingly, unlocking ALL weapon masteries and giving you buffs that helps with each part (gives a 20% damage bonus to ranged, magic, and melee damage and +3 to ALL skills). \nThe combat has a ton of diversity and feels very fluid. I wouldn't call it soulslike, but it definitely has similarities; evading attacks and weaving in your own is essentially the combat of the game. Shields and Heavy Armor are also very useful though, so if you prefer facetanking that's entirely viable as well. \nMages can do massive AOE damage, and stealth is very similar to Skyrim. Executions as a rogue are very satisfying. Weapon and character movement is very organic. \nOne issue however many have and i will agree with is this:\nThe game, even on hard, is just easy. You get so powerful half way through the game. Mage in particular is almost ridiculously op. However, i will say that I personally adore difficult games but still found Amalur to be very, very entertaining.\nCombat: 9/10 \n\nWorld/Setting \nThe world is huge, interesting, diverse, and simultaneously generic. Enemy variety is good, but could be improved slightly. Each region and city feels different and like a breath of fresh air. There are vast deserts and forests with towering trees. \nThe pitfall of the settings is its generic. The game was made originally to be an MMO, and was instead refitted to compete with Skyrim. It's hard to explain, but the game doesn't really seem to have a unique identity at all. The fate system seemed to be an attempt at this but really just serves as a unique combat mechanic and nothing more. If you're looking for fantasy environment, this game has it. Sidequests are hit or miss. there are many boring and very cool sidequests.\nWorld: 8/10\n\nStory\nThe Story is interesting but contains little deviation from typical fantasy storylines. Don't expect anything mindblowing or emotional. There's not much to say here, it keeps you interested but also doesn't throw many surprises or any revolutionary ideas.\nStory: 7/10 \n\nOverall, I'd give the game an 8/10\nNothing is really new, but the combat and world are designed very well. This comes at a price of the game not being very unique; nothing in game hasn't been done before. The Story is cool but nevertheless falls flat.\n", "timestamp_created": 1573456204, "timestamp_updated": 1573456204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56965499": {"recommendationid": "56965499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011949824", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 3310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2050, "last_played": 1574187920}, "language": "english", "review": "this is awesome", "timestamp_created": 1573441936, "timestamp_updated": 1573441936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56954158": {"recommendationid": "56954158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136404121", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4086, "last_played": 1574439102}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game to play, and the graphics have aged well.

This includes a friend from high school who went on about how underrated it was but to this day only has about 7 hours on record. This game takes very long to complete, and that might be why, but this pattern also suggests that this game is great at drawing you in but not so great at keeping you there, which is why I didn't buy it immediately and instead put it on my wish-list.\n\nAfter first play-through, I found out for myself. It was great at first but just got tedious after a while. I write this review after having come back and made a second character, which I've now played for a while. Personally I would put this down to the combat and the travel/exploration, which form the majority of the moment-to-moment experience.\n\nCombat is a mixed bag for me. Enemies slowly approach you, and take turns trying to smack or shoot at you. Occasionally they don't take turns, and it's much harder. Sometimes it's a lot of fun; it's a nice mix of tactical play and mechanical skill. At other times it feels frustratingly bogged down and sluggish. The combat is paced quite slowly, and a lot of attacks/abilities have a relatively long windup and recovery. You often end up swinging at enemies that are just out of reach, partly because the angle of the camera in combat isn't great for judging distance, and partly because some enemies just move away during the afore-mentioned windup. This is something that bothered me more the longer I played.\n\nThe world is enormous, with a lot of variation. Not all zones are different, but there is a good variety of environments to explore. The problem is that the actual act of navigating the world becomes unengaging after a while, and I found myself crossing zones just to get to my quest objectives rather than staying to explore. I'm not exactly sure why this is, but one thing I noticed is that, aside from towns and cities, once you've seen part of a zone, you've pretty much seen all of it. The zones are distinct, but lack features that really make them interesting, such as sweeping vistas, enormous waterfalls and cliffs, peculiar structures, or other such landmarks. The game also features various caves and dungeons, but these only have a few distinct themes.\n\nI usually don't care much about the story in video games, it doesn't make or break a game for me. With Kingdoms of Amalur, I still don't, which means the main story is neither bad enough nor good enough to draw my interest. With that said, the meat of the content is the quests, and there are way more than enough of them to finish a playthrough with, and they're generally interesting and varied.\n\nThe character progression is well-designed, and is the main thing that makes me want to keep playing. Each level-up was exciting for me, especially when the next destiny was just around the corner. The destinies are almost build-defining and are a really nice touch on top of the ability trees. The abilities and therefore the potential builds are varied, which makes for more interesting characters as the game progresses. You can also refund your ability and skill points at any time by paying a modest fee to a fateweaver. The game does not punish you for doing this a lot. This is great for experimenting or adjusting your build as you reach higher levels.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game. You might get hooked like some other people have, or you will have a brief but enjoyable experience and put the game down for a while to return again another day, like I did. I realize that my review conveys a mixed experience, while most other ones are shiningly positive.

Yes, that's right; a single player action RPG couldn't even get talents right as they're all boring, passive % damage talents in one form or another. The quests are repetitive and boring, fighting the monsters is repetitive and boring, the action is repetitive and boring, leveling is repetitive and boring, the environments are meh, finding and upgrading gear is repetitive and boring, and the world design and lore isn't special or anything you haven't seen before. The only thing I had fun doing was creating characters, that's it. I have no idea why I waited so damn long to review this game, and I have no idea why on earth this game has a positive overall score.", "timestamp_created": 1572852897, "timestamp_updated": 1572853036, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479592710733413696", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56452040": {"recommendationid": "56452040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235011056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1096, "last_played": 1600565691}, "language": "english", "review": "is pretty coo", "timestamp_created": 1572831656, "timestamp_updated": 1572831656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56442607": {"recommendationid": "56442607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821264299", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1573442372}, "language": "english", "review": "such a great game", "timestamp_created": 1572820661, "timestamp_updated": 1572820661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 7954, "total_negative": 1117, "total_reviews": 9071}, "cursors": {"AoJ4sNbame4Cf+6n1wE=": "Thu Nov 23 23:28:32 2023", "AoJwmpLor4YDdee8+wM=": "Thu Nov 23 23:55:14 2023"}}
