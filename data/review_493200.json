To be honest, I played this game before cracked, but I decided to buy it to support the developers, because I liked it... a lot. Let me explain why.\n\n[h1] Worldbuilding [/h1]\n\nIt's difficult to talk about worldbuilding in a game like this, because the player visits several worlds, each with its own theme and aesthetics, but one thing they have in common is their rules. The way puzzles are resolved is consistent in every world, and seem to function the same, no matter where the player are in the game, which implies the existence of some sort of magic. And given the overall intentions of the writers with this game, I'd say it's pretty consistent in essence. If the rules were different for each world, taking into account the main storyline, that would be jarring, and would disconnect the player from the flow of the story. Fortunately, that doesn't happen.\n\n[h1] The plot [/h1]\n\nSurprinsingly, the plot of this game is very simple. It's just the story of a person going through the five states of grief. Why this person is grieving I won't mention, because it'd spoil the whole story and would robbed it from it's punch, because the story of this game packs a punch alright. I said this game relies heavily, if not completely, on visual and environmental storytelling, and it does it wonderfully. It conveys a hard-hitting messsage without any line of dialogue. Seriously. This game has no dialogue, but the story is written and designed in such a way that they didn't need to. It takes the \"show, don't tell\" mantra to a whole new level. And that's applicable to either the story and the gameplay (which I'll discuss in the related section). Pro-tip: getting all the white shades makes the ending way more powerful. Refer to guides if you are lost.\n\n[h1] The characters [/h1]\n\nThis game features only two characters, a father and his son. The player controls the son. Since there is no dialogue, it's hard to evaluate goals, motivations and personalities. But his actions throughout the game speaks of someone who is kind and compassionate, because of how he interacts with different elements or sentient beings in the game, and the father obviously loves his son, because of some things that happen at the end of the game. Some beings, like the fox, the sentinels and the giant bird are allegories to things in the world the child used to belong to, and represent the five stages of grief perfectly.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is also pretty simple. The character the player controls can jump, roll, crouch, grab to ledges, the works. Basic platforming, in short. There are underwater zones too. He can also interact with several objects, like blocks, keys, balls of light and other elements. The puzzles in this game are basic but curiously satisfying. There are basic perspective puzzles, light and dark puzzles, activate all statues puzzles, and so on. The player can also make the playable character to use his voice to a number of purposes, like breaking jars, light up fires, even to solve most of the puzzles in the game (hence, the comment at the beginning). Because the controls are simple and intuitive, the main character is easy to control, and makes traversing the world a breeze. There are no tutorials that break the momentum of the game, only unintrusive control pop-ins when performing an action for the first time that don't stop the flow of the game whatsoever. Oh, and there is plenty of collectibles, too.\n\n[h1] Artistic and technical elements [/h1]\n\nThe art direction of this game is lovely and somewhat cartoonish, but fits the setting and the tone of the game. Sure, this game hasn't the best of graphics, but, with a story like that, who needs ultra-realistic graphics? Plus, the art direction more than makes up for it. But one thing this game deserves praise is the music. It combines with the story to give it extra punch, and makes all the emotional highs of the game even better. Since there is no dialogue, I won't mention voice acting quality, but the sounds the boy makes fits the actions he performs and the context he is in. The performance, though, is a mixed bag. I played this game for the first time with a laptop GTX 1060, and the framerate dropped like a rock, even when the visuals doesn't look demanding at all. I had to lower the settings to get a playable framerate, so optimization was an issue then. I wouldn't know now, because my RTX 4070 runs everything just fine. The collision system needs work, though, because there were places that the character won't move, even when there wasn't any collision object, like a step or a wall.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n-Excellent story with a hard-hitting message.\n-Superb visual and environmental storytelling.\n-Simple but functional gameplay.\n-The music was just awesome.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n-Some performance issues (and that's tentative)\n-Collision system is imperfect in some instances.\n\nI wish more developers told stories the way this game does, because dialogue, if not done well, can do horrors to a story-driven game, Forspoken being a prime example of this. This game, on the other hand, thanks to the strength of its visual and environmental storytelling, its no-frills gameplay and tear-inducing ending, has no need for it. It's amazing how much this game achieves with so little, and that's why I recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1691186487, "timestamp_updated": 1691187069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143230307": {"recommendationid": "143230307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055440373", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 469, "last_played": 1691898606}, "language": "english", "review": "A heart-touching game that is well-designed", "timestamp_created": 1690930789, "timestamp_updated": 1690930789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143161047": {"recommendationid": "143161047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082423281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 416, "last_played": 1690829249}, "language": "english", "review": "Absence of a hint system hurts the experience a lot.

Sin embargo ni el uso de CPU ni el uso de GPU llegaban al 100%, pocas veces sub\u00edan por encima del 90%. Era como si no hubiera ni cuello de botella de CPU ni GPU, pero el juego \"no iba fino\".\n\nPude disfrutar y completar el juego con un port\u00e1til con una 1060m de 6 GB y un i7-7700HQ.\n\nAhora (al escribir esta rese\u00f1a) he cambiado el R3 1200 por un Ryzen 5 5600G y el juego se comporta de manera estable pr\u00e1cticamente como una roca a 60 fps con exactamente la misma gr\u00e1fica (la 1050ti), memoria, etc. Eso significa que de alguna manera el cuello de CPU era el procesador, pero me sigue pareciendo extra\u00f1\u00edsimo que no se pusiera al 100% para indicarlo. \u00bfQuiz\u00e1 no era capaz de aprovechar el paralelismo de los cuatro n\u00facleos y su rendimiento estaba fijado por lo que era capaz de dar un \u00fanico n\u00facleo en particular?\n\nBueno, ahora la rese\u00f1a \"buena\" del juego:\n\nEl juego no tiene una elevada dificultad, ni falta que le hace para poder ser disfrutable. Los puzzles se dejan resolver con sencillez y muy pocas veces nos veremos perdidos en el mundo buscando c\u00f3mo resolverlos.\n\nPara m\u00ed eso es un punto muy positivo.\n\nHe jugado a juegos en los que me he quedado atascado en alg\u00fan puzzle durante m\u00e1s tiempo del deseado no porque no fuera capaz de resolverlo por m\u00ed mismo, si no porque no estaba bien dise\u00f1ado el juego para \"mostrar\" las pistas necesarias para que lo resuelvas, y en algunas ocasiones la resoluci\u00f3n parec\u00eda que ten\u00edas que saberla de antemano sin que recibieras pistas de ninguna manera.\n\nEn ese aspecto este juego me parece fant\u00e1stico. Un equilibrio muy bueno que, adem\u00e1s, suma el hecho de que tras finalizarlo (y soltar unas l\u00e1grimas por la empat\u00eda que te genera el juego) quieras jugar un poco m\u00e1s para encontrar los juguetes perdidos.\n\nAl final no he completado esa tarea, pero fue en lo primero en lo que pens\u00e9 cuando lo termin\u00e9, pero suger\u00ed a mi hija que lo jugara y eso termin\u00f3 haci\u00e9ndome olvidar ese impulso de buscar yo mismo los objetos coleccionables que dej\u00e9 atr\u00e1s.\n\nComo mi hija solo pudo jugar en el PC con el Ryzen 3 1200, lo dej\u00f3 abandonado cuando lleg\u00f3 a la zona de la lluvia (casi al final del juego). No me dijo directamente el motivo por el que lo abandon\u00f3, pero imagino que (al igual que yo) se debi\u00f3 sentir mal tras jugar un rato con tan mal rendimiento.\n\nAhora que he ampliado el PC dom\u00e9stico espero que se anime a retomar el juego y que disfrute de esta inolvidable aventura tanto como la disfrut\u00e9 yo.", "timestamp_created": 1667493708, "timestamp_updated": 1667493708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124645825": {"recommendationid": "124645825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166086948", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2026, "last_played": 1694240623}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game so much that I played completely through it twice; once on PS4 when it first released, and then again on Steam.

Your player character moves rather slowly, and feels very stiff and heavy to move. It felt really cumbersome playing as him, especially since the game features lots of platforming and exploration. The camera is awkward as hell, and will fix angles for you whether you want it to or not.\n\nSecond, the collectables. There are so many freaking collectables in this game, and most of them feel pointless. The toy collectables contribute to the game's ending, one outfit helps with an achievement and the shells unlock a nice lullaby, but beyond that, none of the collectables unlock any special features. Combined with the awkward game mechanics above, they feel more like a chore to collect after awhile.\n\nThird (and probably most relevant to a lot of people), the price. Forty freaking dollars??? For an indie game that you can beat in under 10 hours? This isn't something like, say, Hellblade or A Plague Tale, which weren't triple A games but still clearly had a sizeable budget and a lot of work put into the graphics, voice acting, etc. This game feels massively overpriced for what it is, especially when similar games like Journey, ABZU, or even Gris each cost $20 or less.\n\nHonestly tho I think the MAIN reason I don't fully recommend this game is the attitude of the developers. For the last Steam Awards they tried to encourage their fans to help make it a candidate for the Labor of Love award...even tho the last update for the game was four years ago. Either the devs genuinely didn't understand what the award was for, or their sense of ego was so inflated they thought they could get away with getting an undeserved nomination. I'm hoping it's the former, but either way it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThis is not a bad game by any means, and I did find parts of it enjoyable, but there are better games out there, including but also ESPECIALLY Journey, ABZU, and Gris mentioned above.

It has a story but that's not the focus either. \n\n\nIt's hard to give comparison, but it lies somewhere on the spectrum of The Witness, Outer Wilds, Talos Principle Superliminal, and even a bit of Firewatch.

If you aren't interested in the more emotional/artistic aspects of games then there are probably other games that you would enjoy more. Even with that caveat, however, RiME has the feeling of being a labor of love, and it feels like the result of not only a strong initial design vision but also the result of iteration and polish so that everything works together well and the whole feels greater than the sum of its individual parts. I think it is a good example of a game that does exactly what it sets out to do.\n(I think it's worth giving a special mention to the use of dynamic music in the game.

Every piece of it has been set up as a challenge for you to overcome. You're not exploring a world, you're going through a sequence of goals; and if you see a bunch of touch obstacles coming up ahead, you know you're going to have to get through it somehow.\n\nIn that, Rime isn't exactly my favorite kind of game. I like solving puzzles, sure, but I like the feeling that I happen to be finding a way through a strange land - not that I am finding THE only way through the strange land, the specific path that's been laid out for me. Every ledge in Rime is one you'll have to climb up onto, every item is one you'll have to use somehow, every side path leads either forward or to one of the bonus collectibles you'll find which fill in some of the story. (I'd have preferred this game if I only needed to complete *some* of the goals to proceed, whereas *all* goals completed would unlock an achievement or a bonus item, perhaps.)\n\nAnd the story's not much to begin with. Kid washes up on an island and immediately starts figuring out how to get past the obstacles that have been set in his way. There's a fox companion, but unlike other games with fox companions (The First Tree, Lost Ember [actually a wolf], Never Alone, Spirit of the North), this one barks like a dog and appears to only have the purpose of showing you which way to go next, as the lavish environments sometimes make that difficult to figure out.

Second chapter needs some thinking to evade a threat, third chapter features some really majestic encounters, the fourth with the sapping black all around (need to see this on an OLED screen) just visually tears you down. But especially in the end chapter this game actually really managed to connect to my feelings and get me emotionally, can\u2019t really explain why, but it truly did. So in hindsight, even if I at first wouldn\u2019t have expected it, a very strong title indeed. Can\u2019t really criticize much, visuals in their minimalism are superb, music is enchanting, lots to collect and explore. Only two downsides I have to mention.

I just finished this up and in my humble opinion it was a masterpiece of a puzzle game. For a long while I sat on the fence with this game, coming across it in various searches and reading through some of the reviews. It was something I'd wish-listed for several months. Then about a week or so ago I saw a recent review saying it could be argued the game had subtle elements of the game Inside scattered throughout it. This immediately piqued my interest as I personally view Inside as the greatest game ever made. At any rate, I Rime on sale and decided to pick it up. It's just as all the positive reviews have said: excellent puzzles, nothing too incredibly hard, absolutely gorgeous soundtrack, awesome animation and so on. Also thematically brilliant in that it borrows the concept of Elisabeth Kubler Ross's \"five stages of grief\" to great effect. But the part I perhaps liked the best was the world building throughout and that the developers managed to bring an element of exploration into the game. The world is, at times, very surreal and dark. It's true that there's a bit of an Inside-like vibe, and it also echoes the strangeness of games like \"Vane,\" for instance, although Vane was quite flawed, overall, compared to this. Rime's game mechanics are pretty tight, loading times are good, and the glitches are essentially nonexistent. As I played through this I found myself thinking at various times of so many great games: The Talos Principle, Portal, Inside, Hob, Vane and even Ori in a few spots. I didn't cry at the end but I must confess there was a bit of a lump in my throat. But...when it comes to things like death and the loss of loved ones, we have no choice but to face up to our common fate. Rime handles all of this in a very beautiful, heartfelt and inspiring way.

I dunno if it's a bad port (or if it is even a port?) or if it is just a matter of finding what works on your components.. But it can be off putting and make this worthwhile game easy to turn away from far too early on. Most of the suggested fixes in the forums are a matter of switching away from default settings (windowed full to full, triple buffering to double, SSAO to another choice, etc etc). Perhaps they shouldn't have been the default? This game is a visual masterpiece in storytelling but by all means should \"just work\". Especially on powerful systems. I mean, the frame drops I had at first couldn't even be smoothed with G-Sync on. So it's a crying(pun intended) shame it isn't optimized for a wider breadth of builds. \n\nBeyond performance there are some gameplay hiccups as well. For a game so wonderfully animated and with a player character full of life(pun not intended); The controls can feel lackluster. Especially jumping. You just don't get a smooth feeling while making your character move. Then like many games before it, the movement on ledges is mind numbing at times. Shimmying along a ledge and leaping to the next is an exercise in patience of trying to figure out which way the game wants you to point your thumbstick versus the camera. Also of note, there is an odd design choice with the ledge stuff where there's a needless requirement to be hanging or standing on particular ledges. Seemingly identical gaps in different parts of the game require you to transition to one or the other before you can jump. And well, jumping and ledge work are the bulk of the platforming. Some more polish for a smoother wield of the controls would've led to me being completely lost in the amazing experience that is RiME. I have no doubt I would've played it through in one sitting if the controls were smoother.\n\nI only point out these complaints for one reason though; To say they're well worth getting over. Figure out how to make the game run smooth enough on your machine. Take a break if you're annoyed by controls. But play RiME. The visual storytelling is spectacular. To think of how I felt exploring in the beginning and discovering this new world to the way I was rocked and along for the ride by the end is wild. I love narrative experiences like this in games. I'd definitely hesitate to say that the story isn't predictable as you go along, but I still felt more than I expected to when I got there. It really is a masterpiece that I'm glad I played. And the game is indeed fun to play most of the time as well. Sure there's jumps and ledges but there is also really decent puzzles and tons of exploring on foot. Plenty of hidden collectibles of various types as well. You can get lost in the experience at times and it is amazing. \n\nI really enjoyed the storytelling experience that was RiME and the unique world it presented. I highly recommend it.

It's also extremely derivative of games you know and love. There is nothing special about this game mechanically, and sometimes it's trying too hard to be \"cinematic\" and it actually negatively impacts the way the game feels to play. That being said, you get the sense that this game is very important to the people who made it, and if you like games like Journey, Shadow of the Colossus, and the Zelda franchise, you will probably find something to enjoy in this game. I give it a strong recommendation, with maybe a caveat that you might want to get it on sale.

In the background you can see a ruined tower at a cliff. After climbing up a cliff the boy notices in the far distance another tower. One that is gigantic, intact and having a keyhole like shape on the upper floor. The scenery is gorgeous. Everything looks like it is hand painted. It is a pleasant art style, not trying to be photo realistic but rather to convey being in a very artistic hand painted world. Furthermore there is a day and night cycle which nicely wraps the landscape in different tones, where the night is as atmospheric as the day.\nMelodic compositions accompany the boy on his journey through this island and the tower. \n\nNot a single word is said to convey any goals or the story (besides some shouts of the boy). Therefor one could wonder how the game can tell its story and guide the player throughout the journey. Bits of the story are mostly told by mural paintings, secret keyholes (which show a picture regarding the boys past) and a few cutscenes between the chapters. You are never clueless about what it is you have to do next, even though the game is not stringently holding the players hand. The puzzles are not that challenging but more than often you are surprised by how interesting the mechanics are. In general I would say that the gameplay itself is very chill. The boy has the power to interact with certain objects with is voice. He can reignite torches, break specific vases and activate certain statues, all with a shout of his. Besides chapter 2, which brings an element of danger until right before the end of the chapter, you can almost always take your time exploring (chapter 3 had some areas you could not access after leaving them, so there is that as well). And even the element of danger in chapter 2 is rather there to be kind of a puzzle to be solved.\nIn some instances exploring was very rewarding, for example when you see a place in a distance not being accessible at first but when you examine the surrounding area you could find a way to get there and eventually find more collectables or achievements. I like that design philosophy.\n\nWhat I really liked about the end is that the developers made it to tell a story and not have a love, peace and harmony ending (so be warned, if that\u2019s what you always have to want!).\nIt was very touching and after having unlocked the chapter selection, the meaning of the chapters became more apparent in regards to the actual story. I love it.\n\nFor those achievement hunters: There is a chapter select after finishing the game, so there is nothing you can really miss. I was peeking in an achievement guide from time to time after the first chapter to make sure I did not miss anything though. Some achievements are indeed hidden, but if you get them on your own, just by exploring the world, you\u2019ll feel awesome. I\u2019d say play the game mostly without a guide (or like me peeking there from time to time) and enjoy the game. Afterwards you can always replay chapters.\n\nTo wrap it all up: \nRime is not on the lengthy side. It took me around 8 and a half hour, with getting almost all achievements and looking in an achievement guide in between.

It focuses a lot more in art than anything else, so expect simple game mechanics.\n\nSummary:\n+ Good Disney like art style.\n+ Easy to control.\n+ Very calm game. Good to kill time.\n- Too slow, should be faster.\n- Puzzle are too easy.\n- Short game, with big levels, instead of big game with short levels.\n- No real replayability. It sums up to getting all items. It's pointless.\n\nYou control a kid that looks like a Mexican ancient roman that solves most of his problems with impressive physical ability and by screaming at objects. You can pretty much climb anything, push big stone statues, grab heavy metal spheres and swim for many seconds underwater. Very impressive but he is a kid so he can't jump very high. For some reason screaming at monkey statues, vases, torches, and so on, activates them. Makes no sense, and all that screaming can get annoying, but you just have to do it.\n\nThe main selling point is the art style. It's kind of like a classic Disney style and works well, though it could have more shading. There are different themes in each stage, so there is art variety (e.g., water stage, ruins stage). This does make the game a lot more interesting and essential for these kinds of games. The story was designed to fit the art style, meaning the kid is always happy, smiling and tagging along with friends he finds along the way. Kind of nauseating, but as you'll eventually find out, not all is what it seems. The music is nothing to brag about. It's not bad, not good, sometimes annoying and not memorable at all. This is one area the developer could have invested more.\n\nIn my opinion there are some obvious issues with the game. It's a very slow game were you spend most of your time running instead of solving puzzles. It's not as bad as it should be because at least you can enjoy the art style, but it could be a faster game. The puzzles are too basic and sometimes it's hard to understand what you're supposed to do. It should be the opposite, easy to understand, but hard to solve. You do have hints if you're lost, in particular a fox helps. By the way, someone should tell the developers that red foxes don't bark like dogs. Either way these two flaws can be off putting to a lot of people. The game does start boring, but gets better over time. It's also a short game, with big levels. Instead it should be a big game with shorter levels. But I guess the main focus was always art.\n\nSo it's a slow game with pretty graphics and basic puzzles. It's good to help sleep for sure, not that that's bad. It's a calm game and doesn't really require much skill. It's a good game if you like art and have patience.", "timestamp_created": 1621120096, "timestamp_updated": 1621707835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491611391305923462", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91963566": {"recommendationid": "91963566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003562746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 111, "last_played": 1613818050}, "language": "english", "review": "Visually good looking.

The console port is pretty bad here, you can tell the game was designed for console peasant childrens toy gamepads, and KB+M was an afterthought.  For example, \"Shift\" makes you roll, not run.  Presumably the guys at Tequila Works got their name for a reason, and also, they never saw a PC with a keyboard before.  The sure as hell never played a PC game before, or they wouldn't bind \"Shift\" to \"roll\". \n\nThe same console peasant centric design is followed along with completely gamer-hostile camera controls.  The camera is wonky as all hell, and the developers break one of the core rules of game development... [b]NEVER[/b] seize control of the camera from the player.  Except of course, the guys at Tequila Works drunkenly decided players love having the camera yanked off the player.   Well, we don't.  Maybe console peasants like that kind of thing. \n\nOn a technical basis, 4K works, but only in Fullscreen mode.  You can't go that high if you like borderless window, because they either didn't bother testing on PC (a plausible scenario given how bad the controls are), or they just didn't see the sense in making it work properly in 4K because console peasant appliances usually don't go that high.  Also, the graphics are really low poly, again this is because consoles can't render PC tier graphics properly so compromises get made to make the best out of a bad platform.   Told you consoles make gaming worse for everyone.\n\nAnyway, this is basically what might have been an okay game, but it's console ported trash with PC as an afterthought.  Also, it's stupidly overpriced for such a poorly done port.  $40 would get you a game developed for PC, with KB+M working smoothly, proper UHD support, and proper graphics.

The puzzles aren't to difficult, you might get stuck for a minute\nor so but then it's easy to figure out. Thats not a ding against a game unless it tries to be difficult. This game isn't trying to\nstump you. I feel like the puzzles here are just to add variety of gameplay and it works fine.

Play as a young boy who finds himself washed up on shore of a mysterious island. With the help of a mysterious fox he must explore the island and learn the mysteries of where he is and why he is there.\n\nGraphics/Art Style: I really like the art style in RiME. It really holds up well considering the game is over 3 years old. Characters have a somewhat unique look to them, and the environment is absolutely gorgeous. From the starting beach all the way to the end of the game, every environment you encounter is breathtakingly beautiful. Detailed landscapes inspire a sense of wonder and awe, dark ominous areas instill a sense of dread, and ancient abandoned buildings make you wonder where you are and what happened in the ancient civilization that existed long ago.\n\nAudio/Music: The music in RiME is exceptional. It is a great mix of insightful, somber and tranquil. I added the soundtrack it to my spotify playlist immediately after finishing the game.\n\nControls: RiME controls fairly well. My only complaint is that the character seems to lock on to some ledges very strongly, which can lead to you falling to your death when trying to jump somewhere else. I only had one or two deaths that I attributed to the controls, which is acceptable.\n\nGameplay/Difficulty: The puzzles of RiME are fairly simplistic. I like this, as overly complex puzzles could easily detract from the story, which is the main highlight of this game. Although they are simplistic, there is a lot of variety, and none of the various mechanics are overused at any point of the game.\n\nReplayability: Sadly there is little replayability in RiME. Unless you missed some collectables and want to go back and find them later, once you beat the game you will be more or less done.\n\nWriting/Story: The story of RiME is where this game truly shines. Unfortunately, due to spoilers I can\u2019t say much about it, but what I will say is that I haven\u2019t been this emotionally invested in a puzzle game for a long time.\n\nLength/Price/Value: I was able to beat RiME in 5.3 hours, and I collected roughly half of the collectable items in the game.

Similar to INSIDE in that regard, but that's where the similarities end.\n\nYou play (mostly) as a young \"boy\" (in quotes because i found it ambiguous) and get to follow a fox around that shows you where you need to go for most of the game.  Simple concept, and its shown in beautiful cell shaded style.\n\nBut it gets much deeper than that.  Who is this mysterious cloaked individual?  What are these creatures?  What is this world?

I cannot stress that enough, this game is gorgeous from start to finish, and only gets better.\n\nIf you're looking for a mindless game where all you do is kill people and get points for it, this isn't for you.\n\nThis is a prime example of a game being art with a deeper message that can and does take everything you know and shine a new perspective on it.

Most achievements are easily missed, but a chapter select option is unlocked after beating the game.  \n\nRiME is a gorgeous game with compelling music and visuals.  Each environment, each creature, each towering structure is so beautifully crafted.  The areas feel unique, the scenery is stunning.  Unfortunately, this is all that RiME really brings to the table.  Personally, I could not find the fun in this game.  The puzzles were dull (but pretty!), the platforming was stiff, the walk speed was much too slow, and the story felt disappointingly ordinary.  \n\nLooking at the screenshots on the store page gives the feeling of such grand, expansive environments.  \"Adventure\" and \"Exploration\" are two of the top tags describing RiME.  One could certainly be led to believe this game is full of sprawling stories, diverse places, and lots of content.  This is not the case.  RiME is a linear game.  The environments are giant, but they're also empty.  The only thing earned by exploring them is the occasional collectible.  Some of the areas are designed in ways that are confusing, forcing the player to backtrack large distances or redo long climbs.  I feel there was more of a focus on aesthetics than good level design.  This, plus the lack of any maps, means there's a huge potential to get lost while looking for the one place the game wants you to go.  \n\nNavigating the vastness of RiME is not fun.  The run speed is slow while the climbing is clunky and stiff.  I don't feel compelled to search the lands for secrets when it takes so long to get around.  There's no sprint button.  There's a roll, but it's slow and seems useless.  Jumping while running removes your momentum.  For me, a game with long walks needs something to keep my attention along the way-- whether that's combat or environmental hazards or just a button I can press to make me feel like I'm going faster.  \n\nRiME could be called relaxing, but it could just as easily be called boring.  The puzzles are bland.  Don't get me wrong, they feature very strong and creative imagery that feels satisfying to watch unfold.  They are still very bland, though.  The solutions are simple, the same mechanics are repeated throughout the game with little variation or complications.  There's no challenge to them whatsoever.  \n\nIn terms of value, I think RiME is overpriced.  One playthrough-- wherein which I got lost several times-- took only 5 hours.  The rest of my playtime was spent getting the achievements I had missed.  Five hours of content-- regardless of how scenic it was-- should be cheaper than $30.  \n\nOverall, I am disappointed by RiME.  I enjoyed the visuals, the symbolism, the breathtaking music, but I did not enjoy the game.  For me, it just wasn't very fun.  If there was more to the puzzles, more to the lore, more fluidity towards the platforming elements, then I would be more inclined to recommend it.

It's there.  Expect to have your heart stabbed if you're the sensitive type.  If you're not the sensitive type...  Um...  Yeah, surreal story art game right here!  Enjoy the lush game play experience!!\n\n- Speaking of, the game play involves jumping from ledge to ledge and climbing stuff or grabbing items in order to open doors to get to the next area.  It's pretty loose in terms of direction and you can tell your helper to sod off and explore all you want per area, jumping recklessly into pits or throwing yourself at rocks to find hidden paths.\n\n- Each chapter is unique and provides different challenges and enemies, however most of the puzzles revolve around the 'push box, get key for door, jump and cling to ledges' formula.  Once you beat the game, you can access each chapter individually.\n\n- The graphics are pretty and the camera is very well balanced.  I normally die of motion sickness in games, and fully expected to here, but the worst I had it was in the underwater levels, and it wasn't that bad at all.  Took a ginger pill and I was fine for hours.  Turn up brightness for the darker levels if needed.\n\n- Music?  Music's pretty and atmospheric.  \n\n- There's a fox!  Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!\n\n- You pet the fox!  AND hug it!  (Once, anyway)\n\n- There are many inventive achievements to get and trinkets to collect that unlock all sorts of fun stuff like outfits.\n\n- On the very last scene the camera was a bit laggy, like my processor could barely withstand the experience.  And this is a beefy comp.  If you experience this issue, try turning VSync off.  I also fabulously went out of my way to glitch the fox so he's invisible for cut scenes and the pigs so they were stuck in walls.  Tried really hard to get the boy stuck on multiple occasions, almost succeeded once, but he's good at getting free (better than his animal friends).  So the game isn't glitch proof.  Not that any of those glitched killed the adventure for me.\n\n\n\nIf you're into games like the ICO trilogy or Uncharted series, Rime is a very nice, entertaining adventure puzzle game with very loose story elements, an atmospheric soundtrack, and replayability.

The puzzles are very easy, but that's okay because the game is pretty clearly meant to be relaxing and sentimental. Wish the kid were a little faster, but again, adequate.\n\nNow. The story.\n\nI'm sorry to say the story is where it lost me.\n\nFirst of all, we don't spend enough time with the characters to develop a strong emotional attachment to them. Like, at some point a \"character\" we have sort of been solving puzzles with for less than a hour disappears, and the kid throws himself to the ground wailing in despair. And I'm kinda feeling, well, that was unfortunate, but I'm not exactly feeling like crying here. Sir, I hardly know you.\n\nThe goals are also too vague and unclear. You move forward because it's a game and you are supposed to move forward, but there is no real sense of *why*. It's a desert island, it's not like you are going to get back to civilization by diving into underground caves. In fact, given that the first stages are like a beautiful paradise with plenty of food and the chance to be spotted by passing ships, while the later stages are creepy and dangerous and hidden away, story-wise it would make more sense for the kid to remain where he is and build a shelter.\n\nOf course, in the end this logic is meaningless, because...\n\n[SPOILERS]\n\n...the story turns out to be a metaphor/dream.\n\nUnfortunately, that still fails to move me. Partly because by the time of the Reveal I've already been moving forward for no given reason for 4 stages, so it feels a little too late. Partly because, well...\n\nI didn't know why so many indie developers are obsessed with loss. If you are playing an artistic indie game, it's a pretty safe bet that the story is about death, either your own or a loved one's. It's so widespread that it turned what is supposed to be an emotional journey into *routine*. I'm sorry, but at this point I consider it an unexpected plot-twist if they don't die/aren't Dead all Along.\n\nGiven how predictable that theme is, a game that follows it has to do something really special to shine. For example, LIMBO has very creative puzzles and a 100% unique presentation.\n\nNothing RiME does feels special enough.

Rime is a 5 chapter game, and in each one of this is talking about the 5 steps of grief.

It's not fast-paced, and there's no combat or anything like that - you're just exploring the world while trying to solve puzzles (a big plus for me, but could be a minus for others). Playing this game was a serene experience for me, and I would often find myself taking moments to stop and soak in the environment around me. So if you're not into playing a game that has a more relaxed pace/feel, you might not enjoy this as much as others. It's also on the shorter side (I beat it in about 8 1/2 hours, and I played it at a relaxed pace), so you might wanna wait for a sale.\n\nOtherwise, I would absolutely recommend that you play RiME.

Plus it's one of those games where there's no dialogue, it tells its story through actions and cutscenes which this game pulled off very well and this game is one of the few games to make me tear up.\n\nThe music in the game was incredibly beautiful to listen to especially the ending theme. The puzzles in the game were good and fairly difficult but not impossible to figure out. All those Collectibles you can get throughout the game was very cool like the keyhole collectibles.\n\nNow the dislikes, the game is a bit short you can beat it in four hours, it only gets longer if you're going after the achievements. The price for the game is seriously too high for such a short game, I mean I could understand if the game was like 10 or $15 at most but 29,99 that is way too high. \n\nAnd lastly would I liked away to skip cutscenes I mean when I was going after the achievements I wish there was an option where I could just again skip the cutscenes.\n\nNow with that said RiME is an incredibly beautiful and heartfelt Adventure, Puzzle game.

You're told nothing, you just dive into the world you find yourself in and learn as you go, the scenery is gorgeous, vast and actively fascinating.

There can feel like pressure and weight to your actions but failure is gently corrected.\n\nThe music is subtle but very mood-influencing!\n\nIt's a good modest length, I clocked 7 hours while barely scratching the achievements list\n\n\nBiggest downside is it REALLY doesn't play well with my monitors and OBS, it took a long time of turning options on and off at random before it could settle.

I feel like the developer hit the perfect balance of keeping things visually appealing without compromising on performance. You're not going to be wowed by super complex textures or water physics, but game stays beautiful from beginning to end and runs great. What really stood out was how the gameplay elements (climable ledges, interactive objects, etc) fit in seamlessly with the surrounds; enough to make it seem like everything was supposed to be there but not so much that you weren't sitting around scratching your head wondering what to do or where to go\n\nStory (NO SPOILERS) - I've seen a lot of developers try and capture the emotional tones of games like Journey and Abzu and completely wiff. Thankfully, TW knocked this one out of the park. Telling a story without dialogue or written words isn't new, but it's tricky. The overall theme only becomes apparent to the AFTER you beat the game but what blew me away was how well each section of the game complemented each other. There's optional collectibles that flesh out the narrative a bit as well. I missed most of them on my first playthrough but the game's length (~7 hours) and post-completion chapter select mean I'll probably try once or twice to find more.\n\nGameplay - The puzzles in RiME aren't difficult, but I don't think they're meant to be. The puzzles are there to give context to the narrative, and while they're not challenging they are pretty clever and satisfying to solve. There's some mild platforming in the form of some Nathan Drake esque ledge climbing but again, it's there to enhance the feeling of exploration.

I see some reviews online where people are judging the game against what they want it to be and it leaves them disappointed. The real question is, what is RiME TRYING to be, and does it accomplish what it sets out to do? To me, the answer is a resounding \"yes\" to that final question.\n\nGraphically it is gorgeous. I have a mid-range PC and it ran silky smooth on high settings. I believe the performance issues they were having earlier on have been ironed out. I really love the art style in this game. The music/score is also top notch... really beautiful stuff that fits the game nicely. I also really liked the story. I've seen some complaints about the story not being explained or complex... but that's the point. The game is a journey of discovery where you have to piece it together. And when you finally do figure out what is going on, yes, it is a \"simple\" story, but it is powerful. A game doesn't need a dozen characters or voice acting to tell an effective story.\n\nAs for the puzzles, yes, they are not especially challenging, but they aren't trying to be. I enjoyed working my way through them and exploring the beautiful environments. I recently finished The Witness and it was one of my favorites, so I am not opposed to some good puzzling, but RiME is not trying to be a hard puzzle game. I did find some of the platforming a bit repetitive and the controls were not perfect, but they were more than sufficient.\n\nSo take RiME for what it is, a beautiful journey of discovery with some fun but not overly difficult challenges along the way.

It's confusing, and it doesn't know what it wants to be throughout the entire level.  Is it a maze?  Oh, the maze part is done.  Is it an avoid the evil creatures?  Oh, the evil creatures part is done.  Is it lead the drone through the ancient puzzle areas?  Yes.\n\nThe final level lacks any of the beauty of the other levels.  it rains the entire time and the level is all stone black.\n\nThe game also has a story.  It's not necessary at all, and for me it's what makes the game mixed for me.  If they threw the story out the window and gave me the same first two levels but five different times, then the story just wouldn't matter.  But they have a story and thus fit mechanics into said story:\n\n[spoiler] You play a son who died during a storm at sea who is searching for his father.  Each of the five levels emulate the five stages of grief.  So while the first two levels emulate denial and aggression, which fit really well into the game, the third and fourth levels emulate bargaining and depression.  I guess I felt those during the levels?  But it was so poorly done at the third and fourth levels that the end did not pay off.  The fifth level is \"Acceptance\", which means you simply press W a few times to walk through a hall and let a scarf go.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I spent about 5 hours in the first two levels, having fun.

El punto fuerte de RiME es su sentimentalismo (envuelto en el misterio de su historia), sin olvidar sus gr\u00e1ficos preciosistas y su tremenda banda sonora.\n\nLos puzles no son complicados, pues el juego no pretende ser un gran desaf\u00edo ni atascar a los jugadores demasiado tiempo, sino que est\u00e1 pensado para que el que lo juegue vaya disfrutando sin frustraciones, con un ritmo din\u00e1mico y enlazando poco a poco pedacitos de la historia en los elementos que va encontrando en el mapa o las secuencias de v\u00eddeo (los extras no son imprescindibles para pasar el juego, sin embargo aportan informaci\u00f3n importante para entender la historia). En resumen se trata de un juego corto (unas 10 horas si no nos detenemos mucho a explorar todo o hasta 30 o mas si queremos completar todo). La Historia es el gran misterio que hay que desvelar. El \u00fanico \"pero\" es el de sus problemas de rendimiento (FPS o ca\u00edda de frames/cuadros), solucionado ya casi por completo con parches. Sin embargo, si has jugado juegos antiguos con muchos elementos en pantalla, las ralentizaciones entonces (Nes 8 bits, etc) eran mucho peores y no nos privaban de jugar magn\u00edficos juegos. En mi experiencia personal no me afectaba ya que ocurr\u00eda de vez en cuando, y con menos frecuencia a partir del segundo capitulo (lo he jugado completo en Nintendo Switch antes del parche que lo mejora much\u00edsimo). Es un diminuto gran juego, que pasar\u00e1 a ser una obra maestra con el paso del tiempo, aunque para m\u00ed ya lo es. INOLVIDABLE. Lo estoy jugando de nuevo en PC ahora que lo acabo de comprar en edici\u00f3n f\u00edsica (DvD).

However if you love puzzles , I'd highly  recommend  purchasing it.  The visuals are excellent and the overall story is great. I also LOVED the  design of the protagonist.  Something seems lacking though.  You interact with the world using your voice and carrying things. When that's not the case, you're just climbing. Given the ultimate twist to the entire game, I feel like it could have been a lot more adventurous. The overall themes have  various interpretations that  would have allowed  for many potential enemies and allies. While what we got was ok, I feel  it was a little uninspired.  I started to want to do more than jump from ledge to ledge and scream \"Hah!\"  Or carry glowing orbs around.  If you need  a little guidance even in a sandbox setting, you're fresh out of luck.   It's entirely possible to a puzzle wrong and have to start a stage over to remedy that. You're going to have to find  a good online guide.  The closest thing this game has to that is a little fox that barks at you and even so, you'll need to solve a puzzle to get him.  I purchased this game while it was on sale.

It is, after all, a gorgeous game, and I must admit, I was captivated by it almost the entire way through.  But there are two things I really didn't like about this game.\n\nThe first was that most of the puzzles weren't interesting, once you are introduced to their mechanics.  Basically, the game will introduce a puzzle mechanic, and the first puzzle might be somewhat confusing, but after that, almost all puzzles are straightforward variations of it.  Some aren't even puzzles so much as busy work, especially climbing sequences.\n\nI could excuse this defect because the game has really gorgeous aesthetics to it, and the protagonists, despite the lack of words, have endearing qualities to them.\n\nThe thing that really annoyed me about this game is the following.  About 3/4ths of the way through the game, I mentioned to my wife, \"I really hope that [hackneyed plot twist] isn't true.\"\n\nAnd waddya know?  It turned out to be true!\n\nAnd that was so disappointing, not just because it has been done to death, but because it does not serve to tie any of the other game's elements together.  Frankly, the game would have done better to leave you in the dark to form your own hypotheses.  Instead, it clumsily attempts to hit you over the head with its \"big reveal,\" but misses by a mile.\n\nWhat follows is my opinion, which slightly gives this away, and so I will shroud most of it in a spoiler:\n\nI think this game suffers from what a lot of media suffers from these days: the need to be deep by over-explaining things.  Professor X can't just have gone bald, because Male-Pattern Baldness is a thing.  He has to have lost his boyish mop of hair after being strapped into a machine of death.  Han Solo can't just be named Han Solo, because it's just a name.  No, he has to acquire it, because he \"goes it, alone.\" (and, for some reason, people in a galaxy far, far, away are aware of Spanish).  In this case, [spoiler]you can't just have a child truly journey through a mysterious island with ancient technology, and unconventional topology.  No, it has to turn out to be \"like a deep metaphor for loss, and grief, man.\"  Give me a break.  If you're going to do that, at least do it well.  Have the Fox, the scary bird thing, and the ancient walking robots be symbolic of this.[/spoiler]  Instead, we get what amounts to a hairy dog story in video game form, and that really does the rest of the  game a disservice.", "timestamp_created": 1593582739, "timestamp_updated": 1593584059, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492241263389587402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71772574": {"recommendationid": "71772574", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965768605", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1593566269}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: beautiful game that reminds Journey, easy to grasp, nice ending.\n\nCons: way too short, too pricey, the puzzles are too easy, not really inspired, and there is no replayability.

If you're expecting a casual, relaxing walking simulator, \"Rime\" is not quite that. Because in order for a game to be that, it wouldn't ask so much from its players as \"Rime\" does. Most of its puzzles are fair enough, but some others can be really brain-wrecking and time consuming. So this is the first thing to learn about this game: it's not so casual as it looks. It will take you some time; my first run in it took me close to six hours.\n\nThe game is very much a semi-open world, with these large areas. There's very little to indicate you where to go, since the game goes for minimalism, but it surely could use a way to at least point players where to go next, like in \"BioShock: Infinite\", \"Alien: Isolation\" and even \"Mirror's Edge\". For \"Rime\", there's this fox that barks at you, pointing you where to go in bigger areas. And sometimes, there'll be lights coming from the ground into the sky like beacons. Those are helpful, but a bit cumbersome; a mini-map could have aided much.\n\nAs a puzzle game, it has its fair share of classic key fetching, and sometimes you'll need to carry small objects to complete your goals. You'll also be dragging larger blocks around like in a \"Tomb Raider\" game. One little problem with the game is that it can have some annoying backtracking, as once you activate something, you're required to walk your way back into where you've been before. It's not something that happens often, but it's a noticeable issue nonetheless.\n\nThe game is heavy on puzzles, but one big thing about \"Rime\" is the platforming. There's a lot of jumping and climbing to do in this game, and controls are fluid and reliable - except however when you need to drop down from some higher ground, as landing from certain altitudes will stun your character for a bit. There's also a lot of swimming in this game, but underwater environments can get very big and very disorienting, while you can only hold your breath for so long.\n\nThis brings me to something important: you can actually die in this game. Falling from large heights and drowning are the ways the environment can kill you. As for enemies, you'll come across the \"shades\": sinister creatures in dark hoods who are harmless at first, but become dangerous later on. In a level, you'll also see this giant bird that can poach you if you stay in the open for too long. The good news however is that once you die, you immediately pick up from close nearby, meaning that you don't lose anything at all. The deaths in this game will be more of a nuisance than a heavy frustration.\n\nThe visuals are splendid, and many compared them to \"Breath of the Wild\": it doesn't go for ultra-realism, but instead for painting-like graphics that are exuberant and evocative. It even feels like those short animated films you see in YouTube. The thing however - and I don't think this is something all players experienced or will experience - is that my PC would get really hot while playing this game, to the point I could personally feel it. And this scared the hell out of me, more than any of the enemies or visuals in this game. I toned the graphics down, but even then my PC would still heat up like a fireplace. It's weird that happens for a game in which the visuals don't even look that demanding.\n\nThere are plenty of collectables in this game - so much in fact that to call this game a collectaton wouldn't be so far off. Some of these collectables are easy to find, but others are very well hidden, representing massive detours from the main path. After you beat the game, you can access the levels individually at the main menu to pick up what you missed. There's also a lot of achievements, so this game will keep completionists busy for a time. You can even unlock new clothes for your character, but they're just cosmetic; it would have been nice if different clothes would bring certain benefits.\n\nSpeaking of your character, this is when I address the story, and I left it for last for a reason. I won't spoil anything, but I'll just say that the main idea of this game was treated clumsily. It tries to tell a story in a symbolic fashion, but at some flashbacks, the game kind of lies to us in order not to reveal itself so soon. And the game is so minimalist with its storytelling (not a word is uttered throughout the whole game) that some players might not even get it after concluding it. The story itself is quite noble and surprisingly profound, but I wish its themes were treated better.\n\n\"Rime\" is a flawed gem of a game. It is much more than its visuals alone, and you should definitely buy it if you're a fan of puzzles, platformers and collectatons. It assimilates all that is familiar to us in its own unique way.", "timestamp_created": 1593477843, "timestamp_updated": 1643718797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71606343": {"recommendationid": "71606343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198984719246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1695775009}, "language": "english", "review": "this is an amazing game with beautiful music and a wonderful story", "timestamp_created": 1593381363, "timestamp_updated": 1593381363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71582525": {"recommendationid": "71582525", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982836239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1593358682}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome art design and excellent sound track.", "timestamp_created": 1593359222, "timestamp_updated": 1593364924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71436579": {"recommendationid": "71436579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129920929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1555252818}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1593207817, "timestamp_updated": 1593207817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71408572": {"recommendationid": "71408572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271621062", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 611, "last_played": 1593183659}, "language": "english", "review": "Like Limbo or Inside - without the scares.\n\nIf you have like games like Limbo and Inside, you will most certainly love this one.

There are environmental puzzles to an extent, but they don't feel like full-on puzzle games either.  And you're actually doing something, so they're definitely not walking simulators.  \n\nWe like to put names on things, and these games kind of defy categorization.  Each one is its own unique self-contained experience.  For that reason they might just be tough to make, too.  \n\nIs this true?  Explain yourselves, developers!\n\nThis particular one lands somewhere between NaissanceE and Ico, which is a pretty good place to be.  It's not as pure and abstract as NaissanceE, nor as grounded in narrative structure as Ico.  \n\nLike Ico, you play as a little kid who's not the slightest bit afraid of heights; but for all of the acrobatics, what they're really focused on here is creating a certain mood.  To do this they rely heavily on one of the most difficult and underappreciated skills in storytelling: knowing when to shut up. \n\nYou wake up on a beach, alone.  A less confident game would immediately start dumping text onto you--maybe a flowery poem or a cryptic quote or something--to tell you how to act and feel; or even worse, they'd give you a chattering companion to follow you around like a nervous salesman trying to close the deal.\n  \nNot here, mercifully.  Just you, the wind, the waves, the rustling grass, the seagulls, some low-key music and the sun rising and setting as you head out to explore this strange new island on your own.  It's a totally different sort of immersion.  The game simply creates a space and invites the player to reach out and fill it.  Without saying a word they make you want to investigate every last corner; but not in a hurry.  This style slows you down to a point where you feel really present in this place.\n\nThey do speak to you along the way, but it's a visual sort of language, subtle little signposts of meaning that offer both guidance and new questions.  The little \"i\" up there in the title, for instance, is like that because it's supposed to look like a keyhole, a theme that shows up throughout the white tower that serves as the game's physical and figurative axis.  Other elements like the fox and the red cape appear to draw your eye and pull you gently down the game's path; and the road changes a lot as you go. \n\nAt the beginning things seem perfectly tranquil.  Time and time again I found myself stopping just to listen and watch, looking out over some magnificent ocean vista.  Seriously, this first part is just absolutely gorgeous. At one point you interact with a puzzle that causes the whole sky to wheel around you, and I actually said out loud, \"wow!\" \n \nArrive at the next section, though, and and the tranquility gives way to a frenetic, hunted tension.  Each new level brings with it a similar shift in tone.  By the time you get to the rain section, the atmosphere of crushing sorrow is so thick you practically choke on it. \n \nIf you're more perceptive than I am, it might dawn on you at some point that there's a coherent purpose to what they're doing here; but rest assured they explain everything in the end and it makes perfect sense.\n\nSo while you might be thinking that this whole thing sounds awfully \"artsy,\" they're not being pretentious about it at all.  It comes across as very sincere and heartfelt, like the authors had a genuine vision they wanted to convey.  They really are trying to show you something, not obscure it behind a cloud of oh-so-cleverness like some games do.\n\nOf course, it'll surprise no one that the story is ultimately geared to make you feel bad.  That's pretty much par for the course with these things, huh? \n \nI wonder if that lingering bittersweet aftertaste is part of why this game doesn't seem to get talked about as much as, say, Ico.  Although Ico also had a more overtly personal story, too, with the girl and all that, whereas this one is more allegorical; so maybe Ico is a little easier to connect with in that sense.  Plus, nothing here quite matches that drawbridge scene, which was one of the most brilliant examples of visual storytelling you'll ever see in a game. \n \nStill, it's a worthy addition to the whatever-you-call-it genre.\n\nAnd hey, developers take note: they managed to build this entire game of mystery and wonder without including a single sewer level.  Was that so hard?\n\n\n\nYou can find more indie game reviews at [url=https://oddlittlegames.com] oddlittlegames.com [/url] or visit my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34514756/] curator page.

I'm really impressed with how this game managed to convey such a clear story without words..\n\nMy thoughts on this game (SPOILERS)\n-\n-\n-\nI think the \"boy\" was the father all along, and the entire journey symbolized his journey through the stages of grief. The reason he started out as the boy was because in his mind, he'd rather he had been the one to die in the accident instead of his son, which is why we see the seemingly misdirecting scene at the beginning: it was his denial that started this whole journey. The world is seemingly beautiful and perfect, but there is always that nagging feeling of wrongness, symbolized by the red hooded figure he is always chasing, but can never quite reach. Gradually, anger sets in and the world is a desolate, scorched land plagued by monsters. We also begin to see the dark creatures that symbolize depression and grief. The giant bird represents our psyche that actively tries to fight back and continue our state of denial but as we pull out the stops and let the grief run free (the smoke), this opposing force weakens until we are able to face the fact that something  bad has happened. In the bargaining stage, the dark creatures become hostile but the boy can seemingly fight back against them using the light orbs and the robots, and for a while it seems that the boy could win. That he could change the world back into the sunny place it used to be. But then we see the last of the robots sacrifice itself to open a door into more gloom and darkness, and you see the boy finally break down. The last stage is pretty obviously grief and depression. Instead of lighting torches, you proceed by extinguishing them. There is no light, and the dark creatures leave you be because you are clearly not a threat anymore. As the last of your hope dies (the fox), you stop feeling and become numb (stone). Life feels pointless, you've screamed so much you've lost your voice and you literally become a shadow of yourself. In the last stage, the boy fights to open up the flood gates and let the light back into the world, and finally the truth is revealed and relived. The \"boy\" walks towards the corridor and confronts himself (as the father). He chooses to accept his fate and leaps into the void. The father then gets up and goes to his son's room for the first time in a long time. All the locks the boy opened through out the game culminates in the final, physical act of unlocking the door into the room.

Are you the kind of person who can decode the ending of The Sopranos, either by yourself or with a couple of hints? Do you love \"Ways of Seeing\" by John Berger? Then this game is probably for you. \n\nIf, like me, you would never, ever in a million years have figured out what happened to Tony Soprano without that Master of Sopranos guy explaining it, or you tried to read \"Ways of Seeing\" and didn't understand WTF Berger was trying to explain and didn't particularly care; then this will probably just be another blah 3rd person platform puzzler. If you like that gaming genre, you might like it, but the controls feel sluggish and unresponsive. I get a strong \"poorly optimised console port\" vibe from it.  \n\nEvery 3D puzzle game I play now gets compared to [i]The Talos Principle, Portal[/i] and [i]Portal 2[/i]. Those games had a narrative, atmosphere, and/or carefully crafted mystery that inspired me to persevere with the tougher puzzles. The plot in [i]RiME[/i]... exists[1] as far as I can tell and that's about it. Again, this is probably because it is told purely visually, so I'm no doubt missing a lot.\n\nThe difficulty of the puzzles (at least as far as I got with it) lies exclusively in decoding the visual cues that explain the mechanics. Once you understand the mechanics that the visuals are trying to communicate, they are utterly trivial. Compare with [i]Talos[/i] or [i]Portal[/i], where the mechanics are explicit, but the logic is challenging. \n\n[i]The Talos Principle[/i] evoked an incredible, simultaneous combination of joy and melancholy. My emotional response to this game can be summed up as either \"that's pretty\" or \"that's annoying.\" YMMV.\n\nI did not enjoy this game.\n\n[1] [b]SPOILERS[/b] [spoiler]My best guess at the plot is: you are a prince. You have been shipwrecked/orphaned/killed (not sure which). You must navigate the ruins of what may or may not have been your kingdom. You are not given much of a reason to do this beyond figuring out what happened to you. You have a pet fox. It is not much help. I got to the windmills level with the big bird. It is pretty obvious you have to activate the windmills to drive off the bird so you can use the golden ball to set the time of day, then stand on the pedestal so yours and the statue's shadows open the portal.[/spoiler] I didn't care enough to bother.\n\nEDIT: Just read the plot summary in Wikipedia.

RiME is a beautiful game. The landscapes and stunning visuals just ooze a one of a kind atmosphere, developing tonalities that play a part in the larger narrative. It has the capacity to be meditative and small, in moments just a wonder-filled story about a boy encountering a magical island steeped in myth, but also larger than life and compelling if you'll listen.\n\nI've played exploration puzzler games for years, starting with the Myst games when I was a kid, and I have to say that if you're looking for a game to wow you with complexity and crushingly difficult puzzles, that isn't what RiME is about. The puzzles in RiME are a mechanism of the story-telling and while they are often surprising and always fun to interact with, they just don't have that kind of difficulty as an object. That said, if you're looking for a story told in long dialogues and filled with characters verbally developed, this is also not what RiME is about. Instead, RiME is an exercise in the kinds of stories that can be told beyond words, and it tricks you into loving every part of the world that they made along the way.\n\nSo please as you play this fantastic game (and you really should!) take it slowly. Explore. Be playful. Take time to experience the world and feel your way through this masterful piece of story-telling. Too many games today tell the same stories, packaged in the same way, or have nothing to say at all. RiME is a breath of fresh air, from a team of developers who took the time to craft something poignant and meaningful. \n\nHope you enjoy it as much as I have!", "timestamp_created": 1579816825, "timestamp_updated": 1579816825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62213229": {"recommendationid": "62213229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045633368", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1561201924}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1579667701, "timestamp_updated": 1579667701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62091093": {"recommendationid": "62091093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132898070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 647, "last_played": 1599622418}, "language": "english", "review": "This a very complex and interesting game.

The puzzles are shallow and reminiscent of every other puzzle game in existence (moving boxes, basic platforming, borrowing Journey's voice mechanic, etc.). Because of the lack of dialogue, the story is entirely told through occasional cinematics and environmental storytelling. Unfortunately, these things aren't executed as well as in many other games that use them, and for the majority of the game you're left guessing at what's really going on. I came up with my own interpretation of the story based off of the scraps of information the game provided, and was unsatisfied when the full story was essentially packed into the last 5 minutes and clashed with what I thought was going on. Even after the game was finished, I had to look up the synopsis of the game to answer the question: \"What happened?\" Even understanding now what the game is about, there are certain elements that are still confusing. \n\n[spoiler] This game is meant to represent the 5 stages of a father's grief over his son. Okay, cool concept. But there's just not enough concrete storytelling to have everything in the game make sense with this. What do the robots in the green temple area represent? What do they have to do with grief? Are the shadow people just grief personified, or are they something else? Sure, the monster bird thing probably represents anger, so what do the windmills represent? What does the storm in the windmill area represent? Why is the kid's voice his source of magic, besides to copy Journey? This game feels like it was supposed to be something besides an allegory for grief, but maybe that's just me.

There is one quality that all video games endeavor to share, though: that they are entertaining, that they are fun. Lamentably, and as much as this reviewer wishes it were not the case, [i]RiME[/i] just does not deliver on that front, despite being created with so much apparent care.\n\n[i]RiME[/i] sees you filling the sandals of a young boy shipwrecked on a mysterious island populated by ancient ruins, curious statuettes, a delightful red fox, and plenty of mysteries. Throughout your time on the island, you'll look to discover who you are and how you managed to end up here in the first place. Your journey will take you through a variety of beautiful locales, dizzying heights, and treacherous lows, all of which have been beautifully (and stylishly) realized with Unreal Engine 4. All the while you're accompanied by a haunting and lovely soundtrack. It's these qualities that make it so unfortunate that [i]RiME's[/i] gameplay is such a woeful slog.\n\nRest assured, it's not the lack of combat or the heavy focus on exploration that make the gameplay drag so. In truth, at the outset of the game there was hardly any notice of a drag at all. As [i]RiME[/i] proceeds, though, the block-pushing, climbing, and even the decidedly clever puzzle elements that are introduced early-on begin to wear thin. Bear in mind, this is not something that would make or break a game. It's the fact that on top of this, the simple act of movement in [i]RiME[/i] starts to become an irritation. It began to feel like every action made by our curious hero was mired in some way: his running [i]just[/i] too slow, his climbing [i]just[/i] too sluggish, the cooldown on his interactions [i]just[/i] too long. This even lead to a moment of shouting, \"Move faster!\" at our hero. At this time, the very game itself had become a draining experience and it was the curiosity about its story alone that kept me pushing onward to the end.\n\nThat being said, [i]RiME's[/i] ending is touching and heartfelt in a way that was unexpected...but getting there had felt like such a chore that the impact was lessened. I was shocked to find it had only taken around 4 hours to complete when it legitimately felt like it had taken five times longer. This is all written with a pang of regret: [i]RiME[/i] has so much good about it but moving around its world is simply not fun and the player spends most of the game doing it. I feel that the best way to express this is to point to Giant Squid's [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/384190/ABZU/]ABZU[/url], which has no combat, is only about exploration, but is an absolute joy to move around in.\n\nThere are so many things to appreciate about [i]RiME[/i] but it just was not enjoyable to [i]play[/i]. On top of this, the price of entry (at time of writing: $29.99) is far too steep a price for what [i]RiME[/i] brings to the table. All of this being said, I simply cannot recommend [i]RiME[/i]. As beautiful as it may be, as lovely as its soundtrack, its fatal flaw prevents it from being something that all games should aspire to be: fun.", "timestamp_created": 1574576936, "timestamp_updated": 1574576936, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520346879959106445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57658438": {"recommendationid": "57658438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162083578", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1575159971}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me va bien a 30fps con proton 4.11-8 en Ubuntu 18.04.

It's certainly not a bad game; a positive of being so simplistic, but visually competent, is that there is nothing fundamentally flawed in the underlying structure. But it's not a game I can say I will remember or recommend people spend the time playing if they can play anything else.\n\nTechnically RiME looks fantastic, and will really work your PC if it doesn't have the most recent of cards. Your graphical options are fairly minimal, and even on max settings you aren't missing out on a lot from there to low settings and SSAO aliasing off. Regardless you get the visual equivalent of a water-painting, and even if you didn't have any choices with graphical fidelity the game would still stand on its own due to the good work underneath it. Ironically I can't say that this game blasts, say, Windwaker out of the water, but that's more a testament to how cel-shading endures the passage of time.\n\nTypically I don't talk about 'graphics' in my reviews, and this next section should explain why.\n\nRiME is a competent, albeit shallow experience. The game is a puzzle platformer, with you travelling 5 somewhat open but fairly linear areas. I'll give the developers a pat on the back for making this feel like an open-world game whilst not being one-that takes a bit of map design skill. The game mechanics focus on either pulling on objects, grabbing ledges, activating mechanisms, or rolling spheres to change shadow trajectories. There is no additional equipment to collect, which means that you never feel like you shouldn't be in an area, as every puzzle can be solved upon encounter.\n\nWith minimal narrative tools, the game really should be applauded over its ability to give no information whilst not leaving the player in the dark. Part of the fun is figuring out just what is expected of you, and perhaps as an outgrowth of its simplicity it's never too complex.\n\nThere is a story here, and a lack of narrative doesn't necessarily [i]hurt[/i] the game...but it also doesn't [i]aid[/i] it either. See, there's a twist at the end of sorts, but it's less impactful when its the only piece of information that makes any sense. In the end there wasn't much of a story to begin with. I can explain it in a sentence but it would spoil the whole thing. Just as shallow as everything else, the story is a lot of fluff until the reveal.\n\nRiME's development history was tumultuous, and in the transition from an open-world tower defense/survival game the developers likely stripped everything to basics to get a finished product. It's a fine product, but a thoroughly unforgettable one that was perhaps too stripped down to amount to anything memorable. It will get praise by the \"artistic\" gamers in the crowd, but I can't find any solid merit to recommend this over anything else on the market. \n\n4/10: Below Average\n", "timestamp_created": 1572381123, "timestamp_updated": 1572381123, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484629988670349121", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55791108": {"recommendationid": "55791108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126409901", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1572061557}, "language": "english", "review": "Excelent Game", "timestamp_created": 1572061619, "timestamp_updated": 1572061619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490289121866226196", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55680307": {"recommendationid": "55680307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017003179", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 703, "last_played": 1571448505}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful visuals, story, and music.

Since I'm not all that enamored of it, I really don't think it's worthy of a Thumbs Up and I feel bad about giving it a Thumbs Down.  But, since there are plenty of positive reviews here, I guess I'll go the negative route and Not Recommend it.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\nAesthetically, \"RiME\" is a beautiful game both visually and aurally.  It's got a good, solid theme.  And, mechanistically, my only gripe is that the game tends to grab and reorient the camera for its own purposes instead of leaving it where it belongs for mine.  \n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\nUnfortunately, there are several big faults with it:\n[list]\n[*]The story is very weak, and, when you get down to it, what the story has you doing really has no logical connection to the end result.\n[*]You don't even get an inkling of the story until you've completed the vast majority of the game.  Coupled with that, or perhaps because of that, you play the game without having any idea of what you're supposed to be doing or accomplishing (or even why you should be doing it).  I spent much of the game wondering if I was letting some vast, old evil loose into the world.  After all, someone locked all this stuff up for some reason, didn't they?\n[*]Outside of aesthetics, the game doesn't know what it wants to be.  Is it a platformer, puzzle, adventure, or exploration game?  Well, yes and no to each of them.  There's platforming, but it's fairly pointless and easy (it works out to a search for guano since that marks places where you can climb).  There are puzzles, but they're all trivial.  The adventure aspect is marred by your having no idea what your goal is or why you're doing the things the game wants you to do.  And, exploration is scarred by the game locking paths behind you for no reason and having no way to go back since it's a checkpoint game.\n[*]The game introduces some kind of \"shadow people,\" gives no explanation for them or what you're supposed to do with them.  Heck, in most places they're entirely passive (basically, landscape).  But, in one area, they attack you for no reason.\n[*]At the same point where the game introduces those shadow people, it starts putting sand statues of people in.  Again, with no explanation or apparent use.\n[*]And, finally (and I have to be vague here because of spoilers), in one stage of the game, it uses a very silly thing as a key to a lock.\n[/list]\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt took me 8.6 hours to \"finish\" the game with only 13 out of 31 Achievements (41%) complete.  Aesthetically, I'm pleased with the game.  But, gameplay-wise, I'm not happy with it.  Also, at its current list price of almost $30, it's certainly not worth it.  Normally, I 100% all Achievements.  But, since I'm not all that happy with the game, I'm not sure if I'll be going back to complete them.

There are little secrets you can go out of your way to grab but they don't mean all that much in the end, it just meant you explored more of the world that was built. I personally don't recommend it cause it will take away from the experience of the game. What you're really here for is the meat/story of the game which is throughout the entire way through, incredibly vague and puzzling but intriguing which keeps you hooked constantly. The payoff of this game comes in the final parts where it all finally snaps together because the story is told without words. The game is adorable, the colors are vibrant, and the sound design is stunning. I could go into more depth but it would take ages. If you want to play this game I would suggest playing with a controller so you can lay back and relax from your bed or couch when playing this game. Being hunched up in a chair while trying to play the game will really take away from the experience. Comfort is key.

Very peaceful and zen with nature. The artwork is gorgeous, the world complex, soundtrack superb and it changes subtly with the progression of the levels. The puzzles and the gameplay make me think of this as a more kid friendly Tomb Raider. The puzzles feel like they are the right amount of hard for me, with some decent queues on how to progress without much back-tracking or head scratching, younger players not used to the genre might get stuck on some of the sections of the game though. Overall, it feels good to explore the different locations of the world as the game progresses and that's it's main selling point. The feeling of wonder didn't seem to vanish. You do need to be in the right mindset to enjoy your sessions without the progression feeling like work (i had to keep them short and occasional) but the whole cinematic ambience is very quick to make you feel at home at once when you come back to it. It feels a bit pricey, i got it on a sale/bundle, otherwise i probably wouldn't have purchased full price, but you can see where all the development money went into as you progress through the game. I agree with some negative points mentioned by other reviewers that the camera movements sometimes feel a bit counter-intuitive and the character moving too slow to really make you want to explore every nook and cranny.

I want to start with what I don't like about this game first before I get to the good.  Beware of exactly what type of game this is.  Steam recommended it to me because I play a ton of puzzle games, and the trailer made it seem like it was going to be very puzzle intensive.  Well if you're a hard core puzzler, DO NOT expect to be challenged whatsoever by this game.  The puzzles were extremely easy.  There were less than a handful of times I was stuck very briefly, and that was always because I literally couldn't find an object I needed or a ledge I was able to jump to.  It was \"pixel hunting\" stuck, not mentally stuck.  I feel like this game had much bigger potential to take advantage of the types of puzzles it used.  Some of them were heading in the cleaver direction but the moment there would be the slightest hint of a challenge, that was the end of the puzzle.\n\nThis game also had huge potential to be challenging in a different way but again was made far too easy.  The platforming aspects.  It is heavily influenced by the original Tomb Raider games.  Often times that type of platforming can be puzzles in and of themselves.  Once again, this game touched to surface of that aspect but never presented an actual challenge.  It left it very ambiguous as to whether I was playing an atmospheric walking sim, or if I was playing a puzzle platformer.  \n\nThe game seems like an open world exploration game at first but it's actually straight up on rails.  Which I have no issue with.  That part is done very well because you feel like you're in a large world but you're always subtly steered in the correct direction without it being overtly obvious.  That's not an easy feat and they executed that well.  There are hidden bonus items scattered variously off the path, however I stopped purposefully looking for them early on.  I don't feel like this game rewards exploration because there is no way to make your character go any faster, and these areas can be quite large.  So if you go all the way to a far corner of an area just to find nothing, you have to trek all the way back to the main path every single time.  It really gets old after a while.  There needs to be a sprint key.\n\nOnto the good.  The game is downright beautiful and the music compliments it perfectly.  I was very absorbed into the atmosphere of the game and I kept playing it just to see new areas.  Your character is very entertaining with all of his little quirks that you can trigger with the \"shout\" button.  He sings when he's in a good mood, pouts when he's frustrated and in a difficult area, shivers when he's scared, says hello to strange creatures.  The art is simply incredible and sound design is also outstanding.  There is no dialog at all but there is most certainly a story with an emotional twist.  I kind of predicted the ending but it was still very powerful.\n\nIf you are on board for a feel good experience with only slight challenges then this game is a 10/10.  If you love games like The Witness, Portal, Stephens Sausage Roll, etc., and are looking for something along those lines, then this game is a 2/10.

The game tells a story, but as a game there's not much to do. But does it need more? \n\nBut I do have some cons too about this game, as beautiful and breathtaking as it was: \n\nThe \"puzzles\" were quite straightforward so there was nothing to solve really. I was overthinking things and trying to do things ahead as I didn't know what was coming sometimes, but when I gave up I realized there was really nothing to solve as you walked ahead and the puzzles kinda solved themselves and I found out I was just wasting time. \n\nAlso no way this game is worth 35\u20ac.

Metacritic ranks this at 78 - I'd rank it more in the low 90's.  Definitely one of the best games made in the last decade (uh...I play LOTS of games) and is also ESRB rated E10+.  Other than the second level, I enjoyed it very much.  The first level was an absolute treat - very relaxing, discovering what to do, easy game mechanics, beautiful visuals, long view distance, no enemies, etc.  The second level brought in the game's only real enemy that was very annoying and left me no time to freely view the landscapes.  Part of the second level and a good chunk of the third level missed a huge opportunity to have relaxing underwater puzzles.  Instead, the underwater bits involve frequent racing through the water just to get to the next section before the character would die.  Plus the underwater bits are quite beautiful but there's just no time available to simply stop and look around.  There's some replay value in the game to go back and find all of the missed secrets and to get the achievements.  Revisiting/playing the first level again is totally worth it but you'll have to decide for yourself if the other levels are worth revisiting.  The game can be beaten very casually in about 6.5 hours and the story is solid even though none of the characters really say anything.  The music and audio are fantastic and timed to the actions of the character.  Definitely recommend.

Each area has a different motif or a hidden meaning and I would say try not to spoil yourself on the ending or major levels before you buy it as it kind of ruins the experience.  You will go through a nice grassy starting island to a desert cliff side to an area that is always pouring rain with water drenched rocks reflecting what little light there is.  Visually and artistically speaking RiME is a very pleasant game to look at and experience.\n\nYou control a boy as he wakes up after being thrown out of a boat, the area is friendly in how it is presented to you and really fits the whole \u201cstarting zone\u201d type of thing that games like Mario 64 accomplished decades back.  You progress through levels by hunting through slight mazes, hitting switches and opening doors in order to progress to the next area.  The areas are somewhat open world, some zones you can run around everything that you see, back tracking all the way to the place that you started, others you are very clearly locked out of going backwards.  \n\nI just wish that it was better optimized, from what I\u2019ve read the game running smoothly is a serious issue even on console platforms.  You will have a major machine but you may not even be able to break 40-50 FPS maybe see 60 every so often but it is very inconsistent.  I mean inconsistent as in you\u2019ll be seeing 50-60 then suddenly go through a tunnel and come out of the other end and suddenly you\u2019re seeing 30 FPS!  That\u2019s honestly one of my biggest problems with the game is that as much as I want to enjoy the story and the emotional ride it gets jarred constantly but the poor optimization.\n\nI would say for the visuals and story alone to pick up RiME, as I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve started to appreciate these \u201cwalking simulators\u201d more and more (so long as they are good) but this one is far more of a 3rd person puzzle game than just a walking sim.  I ended up playing this a few times just to grab every secret, items and story fragments that the game has and each time I noticed something new (as you tend to when you revisit games that you\u2019ve already beaten).

Sometimes even if you do the puzzles right the game still doesn't count them right so you have to redo them, but it's not a big problem.\n- The music is amazing, it's the most important part of this game, it helps you feel like you are truly into this game's world.\n- The story's very nice, since there are no talking scenes or written collectibles, you have to understand the story by yourself (some collectibles help you understand more though).\n- Even though the game is created using Unreal Engine and the graphics are very simple, this game still manages to lag even on good hardware and I saw on some forums that it's not the only game Tequila Works made that was very poorly optimised not only on PC but on consoles aswell.\n- The game's not very long, 4-6 hours for the story and around 8 hours to get 100% completion, the only achievements you have to pay attention for are the collectible ones and some hidden ones which with the help of a guide are very easy. So I think the full price is not justifiable, I recommend you buy this on sale.\n\nNow, even though the game is very beautiful, I didn't find it very captivating, actually boring at times.

Don't watch a review. This game must be experienced firsthand; anything else would be a disservice to yourself and to RiME. Spoil as little as possible for yourself.\n\n\nOriginal review: Unplayable. I'd really like to play this game, it looks beautiful. But I've got slightly above the recommended specs, and turning down the graphics gets me... 24 fps. That would be okay, but there's something about the extremely unstable fps and the fov that just give me a massive headache, which means I can't enjoy what seems to be an absolutely amazing game. \n\nThis is the first time since seven years ago when I built this PC that I've needed to overclock my GPU to play a game.\n\nUpdate Mar 2020: Even with a 1080ti, the game still stutters and crashes. Also, the gameplay is really, really slow. It might be beautiful, but I'm not sure it's worth my time.\n\nUpdate April 2020: Welp, this game has THOROUGHLY redeemed itself. Seems like the one crash was a fluke, because the rest of the game has been relatively smooth, although still with some occasional frame drops. But now that I've played through the whole thing, I can easily forgive everything except the fact that those on less-capable hardware (The recommended specs listed, an R9 280x, are not enough to play this game at all). It's a shame, because everyone *should* have the chance to play this game, regardless of the hardware they run. It's truly a beautiful experience. Even the backtracking that I was annoyed with earlier was mostly a fluke as well. The devs really put some thought into what the player experiences. \n\nI would be doing a total disservice to this game if I tried to actually explain it, but typically a review is meant to tell you whether you should buy the game or not. The answer is not unequivocally \"yes.\" But this game is not for everybody in the same way that any other game is not for everybody. It's just that \"Zelda/Tomb Raider Reboot but prettier and with a more touching and more personal story\" just isn't doing this game justice.\n\nLet me put it this way:\n\nThe Witcher makes you fight.\n\nNier Automata makes you think.\n\nThis game makes you feel.\n\n(The Witness makes you bored). \n\n...\n\nWell, let's say you already knew that. You know you're getting an emotional story mixed in with some puzzles and some absolutely beautiful scenery. I'm sorry that I don't have much to compare this game to. Every other game that I can think of just hits different. This game is meditative. There's no fighting. There's next to no action. Its pacing is most similar to the Tomb Raider reboots, but TR_r feels absolutely empty by comparison. I can't remember the last time I played a game where the story felt this fulfulling, but I can't actually explain why without totally ruining the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1561727626, "timestamp_updated": 1586490838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51501228": {"recommendationid": "51501228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136647171", "num_games_owned": 6955, "num_reviews": 253, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1561982298}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]ICO 1.5[/h1]\nUn juego bello y entretenido que tiene tanto parecido a ICO y Monument Valley que podr\u00eda ser un sucesor espiritual de cualquiera de los dos.\n\nCon un final inesperado (por lo menos a mi me lo pareci\u00f3).

That is the first impression I got. And by that, I don't mean that the graphics are great - they aren't - but that the game is aesthetically beautiful. And not just the graphics, but the subject matter, the approach, the way the story is told, everything has a deeper layer of beauty to it that makes it all the more poignant and hard to ignore.\n\nThe game walks in the footsteps of ICO, there is no denying that. But instead of looming castles, solemn keeps and forlorn crags, you find yourself on a sunlit island with a Mediterranean climate. It might not come as a surprise that the studio is from Spain. White temple-like structures, green grass, blue sky along with a flora and fauna make the game a pleasure to play, the color palette is one of the cleanest and most pleasing out of any game I can think of. How the time of day is shown is better than any other game I've ever played; at first I thought I was imagining it, that the light had changed, but then it really did go from dusk into night, and then into a new morning, all with their own distinct light and colors. Truly amazing.\n\nThe story is for the greater part of the game a mystery, told in glimpses and fragmentary flashbacks. There is no dialogue (like ICO) and no combat, only exploration and puzzle solving, yet the game manages to continue to grip your attention without becoming boring or repetitive. The game does get darker, and the environments change, yet the clean, beautiful, crisp colors don't go away even when you descend into gloomier parts.\n\nIt is without a doubt a game that will bore some, but going into it not knowing anything about it (which is always the best way) will provide you with an amazing experience if you go all the way to the end - and I cannot stress this enough, you HAVE to go all the way to the end. The conclusion makes RiME what it is.\n\nAll in all, it's a visually and emotionally amazing game in a genre that is very sparse.\n90/100", "timestamp_created": 1560018844, "timestamp_updated": 1560018970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51103487": {"recommendationid": "51103487", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979881961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1598682046}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice Game.

This game is not for everyone, and it certainly isn't for me. Let's pick it apart by each of the features it touts as its selling points. At each moment, I'll compare it to The Witness, which is also a puzzle game featuring exploration of a mysterious island and secrets galore.\n\nExploration: The main point to exploring this game is to find secrets, which I'll talk about later, so I'll use this space to talk about the game's movement. First off, this game is linear. There's 'exploration' in the sense that you can step off of the obvious main path to find some secrets, but aside from that the game railroads you in a straight line forwards. Worse still is that your character moves so abysmally slow that I felt punished for exploring, in that it took so long to reach the end of a branch to see if there was a secret there. This game is desperately in need of a sprint key, and exploration feels more like a chore due to how the slow movement grinds away at you. Compare it to The Witness, which has a sprint key that moves you inhumanly fast across the landscape. A good speed in my opinion.\n\nPuzzles: They were easy. Not just 'yeah i get this' easy, but 'why are they wasting my time with this' easy. In the first 100 minutes, I didn't find a single puzzle that I had to think for. Most were simple enough that I understood the solution from the first moment I saw them, and the few that weren't only took a few seconds thought to figure out what a new piece did. You can carry a game on the strength of good puzzles. The Witness, as a game, is exclusively about puzzles, but that ties into the game's deeper philosophy. In Rime, the puzzles were not only simple, they felt disconnected from the game itself. They were barriers barring progress and nothing else.\n\nFind Secrets: This is where the game really fell flat for me. I'm a sucker for good secrets, and the ones I found in Rime just... aren't. There are 4 different kinds of secrets (that I found. there's 6 sections on the extras screen.) You can find new outfits, little wooden dolls, fragments of coins/seals, and conch shells that play a lullaby. The seals and dolls are, at first blush, literally useless, The outfits are... neat? But not a satisfying reward given the time it takes to find them. And the lullaby was... eh. It's a thing that exists. Maybe it has some deeper meaning once you put the entire song together. Again, let's compare to The Witness. Secrets take two forms; usb sticks that hold philosophical quotes and excerpts- usually about knowledge, learning, and the pursuit of both- and optional perspective puzzles, where the secret is an additional puzzle about finding the right place to stand, the right perspective to look from. Each USB, each philosophical quote, again, ties into the game's theme, while the bonus puzzles are exactly that; bonus puzzles. They have literally no purpose, except that they exist to be solved, and The Witness, as a game, is about taking enjoyment in that intellectual pursuit of knowledge and conquering obstacles. \n\nBe Enchanted: I'll give the game credit here, it is beautiful and atmospheric. The soundtrack is pleasant, the graphics are stunning, and the environments you explore are rich and colorful. This game has the visual design down scratch, but at the end of the day, it's still a video game, and IMO if your main selling point for a game is visual appeal, why not just make it a movie?\n\nTL:DR Painfully slow movement makes exploration a chore, and the secrets you find while exploring didn't seem to have a payoff that was worth exploring for. The puzzles were simple and lackluster, and while the game's beautiful, there's not enough -game- in it to justify a 30$ price tag.\n\nIf you want a pleasant stroll around the island with some light puzzling, maybe grab this on sale, but I wouldn't pay more than 10$ for it, and even that's a stretch.\n\nP.s. People say the ending is fantastic and the game makes way more sense in retrospect, but I don't feel like trudging for 8 hours. Did I mention the game's that long?

Although it doesn't approach the greatness of the aforementioned, it does hold its own pretty well.  The developers nailed the atmosphere in this game with amazing music, vibrant visuals, great sound effects, and a touching story that will have you interested in playing until the end (I finished the game in 4 hours, although I did not worry about the collectibles and other extras). \n\nThat said, the game suffers from poor optimization, creating a laggy experience with large frame drops in many areas.  Despite running a fast rig that can max out most AAA titles, I had to suffer through dips down into the 20fps range in many parts of the game.  This ruined much of the immersion that a game like this requires to succeed.  There are also some frustrating control issues, specifically when scaling walls and having to leap between ledges.  These might seem like small flaws, but when the entire game is based around atmosphere and platform-intensive puzzle solving, these flaws add up to a frustrating experience pretty quick.\n\nAll in all, Rime is a decent puzzle game that is worth playing through once if you have any interest at all in emotional puzzle games like these.

Gameplay by itself is ok at best. Buy at a discount.\n\nThe visual presentation is, unsurprisingly, one of the better parts of RiMe. It doesn't, however, really stand out from the genre it populates - visually pleasing adventure games with gameplay mechanics that feel a bit like formalities. Some of the \"woah, that looks cool\" moments feel a bit too scripted and the overall aesthetic isn't particularly distinctive, but it's all quite serviceable. Maybe open exploration would give more weight, catharsis and variability to the visual experience of the game.\n\nThe music is decent, but not especially memorable or interesting. The puzzles are pretty generic.\n\nThe game (and what it wants to communicate) would've been better served by being pricing it at around 20 \u20ac and cutting some of the content. Games like this - pretty adventures with some form of a meta-narrative - shouldn't, in my estimation, cost 40 \u20ac and/or last as long as RiME does. The gameplay just isn't engaging or distinctive enough to not overstay its welcome, especially since the game is a linear adventure without that much significant exploration. The underlying narrative is a decent one, but also isn't served that well by the length of the game. \n\nThe game is still an enjoyable one for the most part and I do recommend picking it up if you're into the genre, but you should definitely wait for it to go on sale instead of dishing out the listed price.", "timestamp_created": 1557667399, "timestamp_updated": 1557667832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50598923": {"recommendationid": "50598923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176918655", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1557611609}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic design, good music enjoyable controls.

Roast meats, steamed veggies, various bottles of  sparkling drinks and your favourite desserts. It a looks wonderful and smells delicious so you start to dig in. As you're almost half-way through the meal you start to notice that the meats are fully cooked, the veggies are soggy from being left steaming for too long, the bottles of drinks are flat rather than bubbly and the desserts are starting to go sour or stale. This meal is just like RIME.\n\nAs first, you look at the game and it looks really well polished. The music and ambience is stirring and initially the world seems vibrant and interesting. The animations on the character is top-notch and this is something that the game maintains throughout as each character is packed with personality and emotion. Early puzzles are varied and clearly give some nods to Legend of Zelda in that they are strictly logic based and visual clues prevent the need for referring to online guides or having written instructions. With occasional exceptions each puzzle can be solved by exploring the nearby area and you can often see the objective but need to figure out how to achieve it. However.. all of this begins to fall apart after the 2nd level. The game starts to degenerate into tedious platforming sections, lots of running between areas just to trigger buttons or events and becomes progressively more linear as you feel funnelled through one area to another when earlier in the game you had some freedom to explore.\n\nRiME is a prime example of developers running out of ideas and not having a good quality assurance process. You can see that they started off strong and then let the remaining 2/3 of the game become extremely mundane and tedious. The musical scores are amazing in once instance and utterly forgettable the next. Some parts of the game have background music that is extremely quiet and is drowned out by the ambience and sound effects leading to parts of the game feeling very empty and unfinished. This mixture of great gameplay and music alongside utterly tedious gameplay and mundane music just makes the latter seem so much worse as RiME's quality becomes like a patchwork quilt\n\nThere was an attempt at a storyline here, quite clearly the devs started to lean into the 'this is art' angle to the point that they forgot it was supposed to be a game. I have played other games which dealt with abstract concepts portrayed via gameplay but RiME fell short by not leaning into the symbolism that is supposed to be telling the story and instead depending upon hidden collectables to actually tell the story.  If you don't find any of these you'll get to the end and suddenly be faced with a 'twist' which makes no sense. Again this patchwork quilt effect whereby the gameplay is detached from the story the developers wanted to tell.\n\nAs much as the 1st third of the game is worth seeing, I simply cannot make that the justification for recommending the game. RiME needed to go back to the drawing board, cook for a little longer with the QA teams and then finally be released but as it stands it simply isn't a worthwhile experience and with a playtime of only 7hrs it isn't even good value for money.", "timestamp_created": 1557080112, "timestamp_updated": 1557080283, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504131138324737549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50494044": {"recommendationid": "50494044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009073659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 350, "last_played": 1551985311}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really nice game. \nVery mellow & pleasant ambient music, very charming animation, nice environmental vistas - The opening hours are just pleasant all round.\nIt's a really basic 3D puzzle-platformer (classic selection of box-, perspective-, etc. puzzles).\nThe main draw definitely lies in the art - animation, music and presentation.", "timestamp_created": 1557063884, "timestamp_updated": 1664830317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50482279": {"recommendationid": "50482279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011822789", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 1363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 717, "last_played": 1583098983}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful.

I'm pleased to say it turned out to be more.\n\nYou play a young boy who wakes up on a mysterious isle after a terrible storm, Its a beautiful environment to explore and straight off the bat you have some freedom to explore, theres no real tutorial to be seen but the overall controls of the game a simple and easy to get to grips with as you explore. The world isn't vast and open so theres no chance of wandering off and getting lost but the island is large enough to have multiple side areas with various collectables hidden about the place rewarding the player who looks around and maybe notices a climbable wall or cliff or small opening, theres more to the collectables than just achievements too unlockable art hints at lore, and there are music and costumes to find and unlock as well encouraging you to explore and rewarding you for taking your time to take in this world.\n\nNow as to the gameplay its fairly basic you roam about the world heading for landmarks (towers or light pillars) scattered about the map, its actually a good way to give direction to players as rather than railroad them you guide them more naturally toward points of interest. Within each landmark will be some sort of platforming challenge or puzzle, personally I found none of these difficult and was about to make swift progress (your mileage may vary) between stops to explore and find hidden loot. In addition to these minor puzzles there is generally an overarching theme to each area/world you visit, one might add in a flying monster that will attack you if stay out in the open too long, another will have non-logical layouts (corridors fold back on each other or connect in impossible ways making navigation a challenge), combine all this with beautiful art and sold visual themes for each area and its a joy to travel through this world.\n\nBut the last part of the game is of course the story, its told entirely without words, through the world and brief flashbacks between worlds, each world has a theme, something that the title of chapter gives away, in fact the chapter titles give away abit too much so I would say avoid any guides on your first playthrough its easy enough and you unlock a chapter select if you want to go back and do achievements later. The story is bittersweet and best just experienced so I'll leave it at that.\n\nOverall RIME is a great time, a little on the short side but still worth the price especially on sale, give it try.", "timestamp_created": 1556787058, "timestamp_updated": 1556787058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50415761": {"recommendationid": "50415761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062025694", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 312, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 375, "last_played": 1556732331}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una aventura que sin decir una palabra, es capas de decir mucho.\n\nEste juego es una de esas joyas que suelen pasar inadvertidas, pero que vale la pena jugar.

Beautiful and inspiring sound track, interesting puzzles, stunning graphics and a thought provoking story.\n\nBefore I begin, I will stress that this game takes TIME. The story has a very slow pace and there is no real context given to the player at the beginning of the game. Therefore, the puzzles you complete and the setting can seem a bit .. strange. But all will be explained and believe me, it is worth the wait! Only until about halfway through the game did I gain any sort of inclination as to what I was actually doing and what it had to do with anything, but nevertheless, the quest to find answers is the purpose of the game and it definitely kept me wanting to discover more.\n\nRiME encompasses many different settings and does so beautifully, from bright and sunny to dark and melancholy. Each scene is well crafted and perfectly utilises light to encapsulate the emotion it intended (especially the last few scenes). It also includes many underwater locations which were one of my favourite environments due to the gorgeous graphics. The majority of the playtime for this game is spent like a platformer, jumping from ledge to ledge and completing a task or puzzle.\n\nAs the game is tagged, it is a puzzle game, and although there is nothing too difficult, there are many aspects to the puzzles which keep things interesting. Despite this, the focus and I believe, strong point of the game is definitely its adventure filled world and subsequent story behind it all. Possibly due to this focus, the developers have been quite forgiving and in the rare chance that you actually do die from the handful of baddies who have the capacity to kill you; you will re-spawn very close to where you died and simply just pick up where you left off. \n\n As a bit of an extra, you can stray away from main objectives which are conveyed to the player by following a helpful fox and find tonnes of collectables. This also ticks the box for collectors, or those looking for a second play-through. \n\nUnfortunately, RiME is a victim of very noticeable frame drops. In a select few scenes it is extremely laggy for no apparent reason and it can only be overcome by simply moving to the next scene. This isn't a deal breaker for me but it certainly wasn't fun and did take away from my experience, considering the heavy immersive focus that the game intended.\n\nLastly, the price tag. Yes the $AU40 price tag seems substantially high for a short (4-7 hour game, depending on collectables). But before I become too pedantic, RiME is a game that is repeatedly bundled together with other games and also heavily discounted on many popular sites for as little as $4. With that in mind, it is hard to fault RiME as it incorporates everything an adventure lover looks for. Although it is difficult to truly describe what this game is about without unveiling any spoilers, I can definitely recommend this to fellow adventure lovers. Don't overlook this little hidden gem like I did, its absolutely worth your time.\n\nIf you liked this review, please follow my curator page for more: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34936724/", "timestamp_created": 1556622482, "timestamp_updated": 1556622482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611459136009216309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50397502": {"recommendationid": "50397502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061084496", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 525, "last_played": 1556604527}, "language": "english", "review": "I came for a puzzle game and got hit in the balls with feels. \n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1556604563, "timestamp_updated": 1556604563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50383509": {"recommendationid": "50383509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031092181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1556526436}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful little game with some clever, although not revolutionary, little game mechanics.

It kinda peaks in the first hour and a half and maybe again in the last 30 minutes. The game is slow, the puzzles are stupid simple, and the platforming is imprecise to a huge fault. That last part is pretty important, because nothing ruins the mood quicker than reaching the end of a platforming section and instead of jumping up, the character jumps 4 stories to his death. Shame, since the mood and visuals are easily the best thing this game has going for it.\n\nThe first couple of chapters are really great. You get to run around these beautiful, open locations. It feels like everywhere you go there's something cool to see (architecture, animals, collectibles). But starting in the second chapter, the game begins to feel more linear, mostly due to the addition of a mechanic that actively prevents you from anything other than making a beeline from enclosed location to enclosed location. The rest of the game progresses in the same kind of way, creating this upside down pyramid of limitation on how far you can explore. By the end of the game, you'll literally be running a circular maze to do puzzles. Understand that there is a thematic reason for this progression, but it kind of drags a lot of the fundamental problems with this game into the spotlight.\n\nOutside of visiting a bunch of cool locations, there really isn't that much to do. The puzzles are easy and the platforming is restrictive. Huge missed opportunity with the vocalize command, since its really only used to initiate cutscenes and solve puzzles (read: open doors). Oh yeah, sometimes you can sing along with the soundtrack. No where in the game is it more than just 'something you can do.'\n\nAll in all, I found the first couple of chapters delivered an amazing sense of exploration and wonder, but the game lost a lot of its luster once every location became a bunch of hallways. Recommended only if you have the patience to sit through the slow sections to get to some great visuals.\n\nThis review isn't finished lol.

Let me be clear about this: I HATED playing this game for the first hour of it, but a lot of my complaints slowly... disappeared as I progressed through the game.\n\nBefore buying this game, I didn't know much about it. All I knew was the graphics reminded me of Breath of the Wild, and it was a puzzle game with very bright colors. I didn't bother to look further into it before buying because it was on sale for $5 and just thought of it as a quick buy. I had very low expectations before going in, and they were pretty much met with the beginning. I had trouble with the controls, the story seemed slow and stereotypical with the [spoiler]amnesia[/spoiler] and such. The music and visuals were good from the start, though.\n\nAs I got further and further in, my opinion slowly changed. I started to enjoy the puzzles more after getting the hang of the controls, and the story took turns I really didn't expect. [spoiler]The ending was absolutely heartbreaking, and wrapped up the story in a perfect way.[/spoiler]\n\nDon't ignore this game.

Smooth animations with rich details. \nGameplay: Casual, relaxing 'walking simulator'-you're exploring the island, solving puzzles (most of them are quite easy, yet with each level they are getting bit complicated), sometimes can be bit clunky during climbing (specially camera) but nothing what can ruin your experience.\nStory: Without saying a single word, the game managed to 'tell' powerful story- especially when you paying attention to little details such paintings or statues. Exploration rewards players with more information (it kinda reminds me Dark Souls games when you must work out to get piece of information and also using imagination ((or you can go to wiki where it's spoiler-free, but where's fun in that?)) \nSound: In short- it's beautiful. Sealing the atmosphere and capturing emotions excellently.\nLast thought: While RiME isn't perfect (having few flaws) and the plot twist (or even type of the game) definitelly ain't for everyone, i'd highly recommended it anyway.

Relatively simple \"adventure\" gameplay bolsters a story that manages to be vague without being esoteric, and which becomes increasingly understandable as the ending approaches.\n\nPresentation: The game looks good. The art design isn't technically impressive, but it's stylistically good. The music is really, really good. The game seems a little poorly optimized, in that my Vega 56 was humming rather loudly the entire time on Ultra at 1440p (with TSAA), but it was 60 FPS throughout the game as I could tell.\n\nMechanics: The gameplay of Rime is fairly basic. You can run around, jump, roll, interact with things, or yell. I never encountered a use for rolling, but the others get plenty of use. You primarily solve environmental puzzles and do light platforming. Neither is difficult, but that's not really the focus of this game. There are collectibles scattered throughout the world that you can find; most are meaningless, but at least one is related to the game's story.\n\nStory: You play as a little boy in a world with no other people, there're no voiced lines, you have an animal friend. I didn't really have any clue what was going on until maybe an hour before the end, and even now there are elements I'm unsure of. As I mentioned when talking about the mechanics, there's one set of collectibles which seems to describe the game's story, and after the game's finished there's a pretty big hint in the Main Menu, but I wasn't able to find all of the former, and even with the latter as mentioned there are still things I'm curious about. Overall I think it broaches a meaningful subject in an interesting way.\n\nWorth pointing out: I finished this in 5 hours. Is this worth $30? H*ll no. $15? Heck no. $10?

There were a ton of collectibles I didn\u2019t collect and a ton of cheevos I didn\u2019t cheev, so maybe you can get more out of this game.  At my playtime I would consider Rime a tad on the expensive side but it has been bundled and rebundled and goes on sale often.  It is an adventure platformer game featuring a great story.  Wait for a sale if your wallet can\u2019t handle the price tag.  If you can't handle the price tag then pick up AER Memories of Old for the time being as it shares a lot of qualities with this game.\n_______________________\n\nPROS  \n+ Beautiful art style.  Everything is richly coloured and detailed but at the same time a bit blocky.    \n+ The soundtrack is amazing.  There are very emotional swelling pieces of music throughout the game that add a whole new level of detail to the experience.\n+ Story.  Without ever saying a word Rime gives us an amazing story in great detail.  It uses powerful visuals, music and level design to push forward its narrative.\n+ Excellent level design on the whole.  It is a very corridor exploration game when it is ushering you into the next area or trying to get on with the story but there are also some tougher puzzles that will have you needing some time to think how to progress.\n+The sounds.  All the sounds in the game feel very real and match the environment. Everything from the waves crashing onto the beach, the thunder, the slap of your bare feet on sand or stone to the seagulls screetching are organic and sound amazing.\n________________________\n\nCONS\n- Some parts of the game drag out a bit too long for me.  \n- Controls can be a bit frustrating, especially in some of the platforming parts.\n________________________\n\nI\u2019m not going to spoil Rime in any way.  It is a game with a really strong story where you are firmly in the shoes of the protagonist and are discovering this strange world exactly as he is.  It reminds me a lot of the old school Tomb Raider games where we find ourselves in self-contained areas that we have to traverse and pull levers in order to advance.  Rime has a ton of places to explore and a tons of screenshots waiting to be taken.

Nonetheless, I wanted to give the game the chance to stand on its own merits irrespective of what other people are advertising it as... and there are still quite a few problems with it.\n\n* The puzzles are not the Myst-type point-and-click puzzles but the sort from Portal or Talos Principle which involve picking up and moving around different objects with the 'use' key. I personally prefer the Myst style, but irrespective of that the puzzles here are simpler and not especially challenging.\n* There also weren't very many of them. In fact, the world seems 'larger' than it needs to be, with a lot of time spent just getting from one place to another which is not helped by how slow your top speed is. The game is arguably more of a platformer than a puzzle game, but the platforming is also pretty straightforward and isn't very satisfying: it's always pretty clear where to go, and your movement is pretty restricted; it doesn't feel nimble and quick the way, say, the Sly Cooper games did. \n* As it progresses the game attempts to get increasingly symbolic and 'psychological', but it's not especially compelling or even really all that important. There really wasn't a lot *to* the game looking back; I was able to power through it in a little under a day.\n\nIf you came here looking for a Myst-like \"Island Puzzle\" game you are better off playing The Witness, Quern, or even Talos Principle; even if that's not what you were specifically expecting I can't say I'd recommend it unless the game is expanded in the future to be less full of itself and more full of actual content.", "timestamp_created": 1554590123, "timestamp_updated": 1554590123, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455386549234390259", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49995606": {"recommendationid": "49995606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041367319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1554518134}, "language": "english", "review": "A really beautiful, mysterious game.

I didn\u2019t expect much, I expected a half assed attempt at a walking simulator but I\u2019ve a great platformer/puzzle game with amazing art, soundtrack and story.\n\nYou wake up on the beach not knowing what happened and start your journey. At first you take your time to admire the scenery because this game is really beautiful. Simplistic cell-shaded graphics was a good choice for artistic design. There\u2019s also no hud so nothing get in a way and can fully immerse in the world.\nThe story is really sad in this one, it\u2019s beautiful but when you realize what\u2019s happening you understand how sad the story really is.\n\nGameplay is pretty basic. You run around in an open environment and explore every corner of it. Although it\u2019s not necessary to explore everything, I highly suggest you do that. You progress the game by solving puzzles and collecting some items. Puzzles are not too hard so they don\u2019t break the flow of the game. This is really more of a narrative game than puzzle, so difficult puzzles would just ruin the experience.\n\nEvery level is different and represents something else. You\u2019ll climbing, uncovering secrets, avoid monsters, run, jump and yell. Yes there\u2019s a lot of yelling. You interact with thing by yelling. There\u2019s also a cute friendly fox who will guide you through the levels.\nThe only downsides I notices are that camera angles sometimes are annoying and climbing controls could be better.\n\nGraphically the game looks stunning. The visual are very clean and minimalistic from the first sight, but there\u2019s so much detail everywhere. Levels are very well crafted. Overall graphics are a work of art. Although the performance can be little disappointing. I don\u2019t know why this runs worse than AC origins. I had to lower some settings to get 60fps and even then I experience big fps drops. Optimization is not very good.\n\nSoundtrack just adds another layer of awesomeness to this game. It fits the aesthetics of the game very well and makes it so much better.\n\nI recommend this game for those who enjoys good stories, well balanced gameplay and beautiful visuals.

The pacing was also quite nice, with the sense of urgency and danger rising with each new location.\n\nSince I was streaming, I skipped many of the collectibles.

Some think it's a walking simulator. Others think it's all bling no ding.\n\nFor me personally, Rime was as captivating and enchanting as some of the more well known titles such as Abzu and Shadow of the Colossus, similarly, Journey too.  \n\nRim is an interesting game in that yes, most puzzles are easily solvable, the story is a bit vague, and the gameplay is limited, but behind these rather minor concerns, you have an extremely vibrant, absolutely extravagantly designed game. The visuals are utterly astounding, some of the best, most timeless art style's paired with an absolutely phenomenal soundtrack that makes you weep and soar in all the right moments. \n\nI had an absolute blast playing this game. I had my fair share of frustration with certain aspects, but the pro's here absolutely outweighed the cons for me. Not many games make me genuinely cry. Kudos to Tequila Works for making such a mesmerising, and truly beautiful narrative that I could lose myself in for some of the most emotional 6 hours I've had in a while. Truly, thank you.\n\nPro's:\n\nTimeless, bright and diverse art style reminiscent of the Wind Waker days.\nTruly captivating and wonderful soundtrack that can and does take you on an adventure of its own.\nEasy control scheme with some interesting game elements.\nVague, but decipherable story with heavy themes and strong emotional appeal.\nA good dose of wonder and mystery as you unravel said story to unveil the meanings and symbolism. \nNot a 'hold your hand' styled game, get yourself out there and learn for yourself!\nWell balanced puzzles that promote progress and a little thought without stopping you dead in your tracks long enough to get flustered.\nDiverse environments to experience and explore, never feeling dull.\n\nCons: \n\nThough I listed this as a pro, it can also be a con. Puzzles are relatively easy, some more intermediate and even hard puzzles requiring multiple aspects of gameplay, such as the use of lights and your ability to create them would have been a bonus here.\nMissable collectables create the need  for a rerun which ultimately detracts from the purity of a one time run, sadly diminishing  the emotional weight.\nSomewhat slow character movement may prove annoying at times.\nSteep price point for a standard 4-6 hour experience, and a 6-8 hour experience if you want to 100% it. Also expensive when considering the soundtrack is not included.\n\n\nHonestly can't find much to fault with this game.

I strongly recommend this game to anyone wanting a relaxing and heartfelt story, you can tell this game was a labour of love. \n\nIf you like relaxing puzzle adventure games then you'll most likely enjoy RiME. There is no dialogue, combat, health or even text (apart from button prompts) in this game so it ends up just being a relaxing experience which you're supposed to unwind and take at your own leisure. The only two things you can really do in this game is walk around and interact with things, which you'll be doing a lot to solve puzzles and discover collectables. If that doesn't sound appealing then it might not be for you.\n\nThe visuals of the game is absolutely stunning in my opinion as it uses shape and form to really help the environments and structures pop, add on top of that great colour and lighting and you have some amazing looking levels that you can just stare at for hours. The use of reflections in the metals and the shaders for the water look fantastic too. I honestly can't get enough of the visuals of this game!\n\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal and you owe it to yourself to listen to it. If you love the Ghibli soundtracks then this will blow you away.

Los escenarios son putamente preciosos, y siempre te quedar\u00e1s mir\u00e1ndolos y apreciando el escenario.\n- La banda sonora es correcta, pero logra encajar perfectamente con todos los momentos del juego.\n- Las animaciones est\u00e1n muy trabajadas: C\u00f3mo baja una ladera, la forma de rodar, la forma de correr... Todos los movimientos est\u00e1n muy logrados.\n- La historia no parece ser gran cosa y puede parecer apenas inexistente, pero todo cobra sentido a medida que va terminando el juego, con un gran final.\nLO MALO:\n- En un juego donde destacan las plataformas puede ser bastante frustrante que algunos saltos no los haga el personaje de forma correcta, o que tengas que pasar s\u00ed o s\u00ed por un saliente espec\u00edfico, y no medio metro mas a la derecha. Adem\u00e1s, muchas veces el personaje se quedar\u00e1 trabado en esquinas o con alg\u00fan objeto aunque no lo est\u00e9s ni siquiera rozando, lo que supongo que ser\u00e1 un fallo con las \u00e1reas de colisi\u00f3n.\n- Los puzzles no son para nada complicados. Quiero entender que no buscan lastrar la aventura o atascar al jugador, pero s\u00ed que habr\u00eda agradecido un par de puzzles que tuvieran algo m\u00e1s de complejidad.\n- Aunque el juego intenta que conectes con \u00e9l, yo no he logrado sentirme unido al personaje y apenas he logrado empatizar (a excepci\u00f3n de un par de momentos).\n- Durante gran parte del juego se me ha hecho divertido el juego, pero tengo que decir una cosa: El tercer nivel es, en mi opini\u00f3n, innecesariamente largo, y una zona que me termin\u00f3 aburriendo a partir de la segunda mitad del mismo.\nCONCLUSI\u00d3N:\nEn general, Rime no es un mal juego, pero me da la sensaci\u00f3n de que podr\u00eda haber sido mucho m\u00e1s.

I'm not sure I have the words to do it justice, so I'll just use some quotes from celebrities:\n\n\"It's all been rather lovely\"\nJohn Le Messurier, actor in the BBC comedy 'Dad's army', said those words before he died. He was ruminating on his life and not this game, but he probably would have said the same thing if he'd ever played it.\n\n\"RIME was alright to play, I guess. I prefer manlier activities like sticking my boot / shotgun / chainsaw up a demons butt. No! I'm not crying! Just got some....um... acidic demonic blood in my eye...yeah....stings like a mutha! Pass me a tissue\"\nThe DOOM guy \n\n\"What did I think of RIME? Emotions are for girls......now, pass me a tissue. I got some, er, acidic alien blood in my eye, and it, uh, stings like the mutha-****** of all mutha-******s. I, uh, need to dab it out before the, um, acid eats all the way through my brain. Yeah! That's it. Duke, you crafty fox! Those suckers will never know you were crying. Hey! Wait! Is that thing still recording?\"\nDuke Nukem\n\nI can't really sum up the plot of RIME too much, because it kind of doesn't have one - at least, not in a conventional sense. You play a boy who wakes up shipwrecked on a mysterious island, that is gradually revealed to be far less normal than it first appears. Despite looking like an ancient place in the mediterranean it has robots, shadowy creatures, strange mechanisms seemingly powered by magic, and an evil giant bird that really doesn't seem to like you very much.\n\nHow did you get there? What is going on? What are you meant to be doing? It's one of THOSE games....where what little you get told is 80% visual storytelling, and the other 20% comes from the moody / sombre / melancholy / soaring music. No dialogue. No text. \n\nThe ending isn't too ambiguous as to its meaning, but until then it's just a \"feeling\" the game gives you whilst the island gets more and more weird. Not weird in a Far Cry 3 drug trip kind of way, yet enough that you'll question how this place came to be, what it's for, and what every activity you're doing in it is all about.\n\nIt's a fairly gentle platformer with some mild puzzles, and takes a few hours to finish. I honestly can't make the game play sound anymore exciting than that, because it isn't. If you can't get swept up in the beautiful, simple, music or get hooked by the emotive narrative (such as it is) / sense of discovery, then the relatively sedate action isn't likely to satisfy.\n\nIt's not a twitch platformer, or has mind bending conundrums. It's \"nice\", and will maybe punch you in the feels come the conclusion. I'm not that familiar with games of this type on PC, and the only one that springs to mind would be a dead giveaway as to the ending of RIME if I named it as the two aren't all that dissimilar. It's relatively comparable to the playstation games ICO / Shadow Of The Colossus / The Last Guardian mechanically, and in it's themes of love, loss and regret.\n\nI wouldn't have said it matched the last two for emotional oomph, but it's a moot point if you don't own a playstation, and to be fair to RIME it plays better than any of them. If a long play time is your thing then this may disappoint, as I think it took about 7 hours to finish. Though that's not so short for the type of game that it is, and what's there is really well made. \n\nThe production values are quite high, it's glitch free, and runs fairly well, so I'd recommend it...if it sounds like your \"cup of tea\", of course. I just can't say what that \"cup of tea\" exactly is without spoiling it....\n\nIf you found this review to be helpful then why not check out my curator page here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/The_dull_games_reviewer", "timestamp_created": 1552013341, "timestamp_updated": 1617098828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605642259120941162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49416232": {"recommendationid": "49416232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069998768", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1551821688}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es lo m\u00e1s aburrido que he jugado \u00faltimamente.\nSin ni quiera una introducci\u00f3n o una voz en off que te ponga en situaci\u00f3n, te pasas todo el rato persiguiendo un zorro y grit\u00e1ndole a luces y estatuas.\nEn ning\u00fan momento sabes lo que est\u00e1 pasando ni por qu\u00e9 tienes que seguir avanzando.\nAl final me cans\u00e9 de perseguir al zorro.

I picked it up for $3 and went in with fairly low expectations due to the mix of positive and negative reviews on the store page. I actually ended up being pleasantly surprised! Rime is a beautiful game that tells a story in an interesting way, and it does it with relatively few frustrations. \n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]Rime really is beautiful, I love the aesthetic here and it remains pretty consistent throughout the game. The first three chapters are particularly beautiful, with the fourth being quite haunting. There were a couple of textures that looked a bit rough to me, but really good overall. I also think that all of the creatures in the game are really well designed.\n\n[*]One thing I was quite pleased with was that the puzzles were quite straightforward. There were definitely a couple of puzzles that had me stumped for a minute or two, but for the most part I found them easy to figure out. Now, not everyone will think that\u2019s a good thing, but personally I think Rime is much more of an adventure game than it is a puzzle game. The puzzles are certainly fun, but the real meat is exploring the world Tequila created and piecing together the story. I don\u2019t think Rime would work as well as it does if less-experienced puzzle players were constantly forced to check guides/walkthroughs to figure out how to carry on.\n\n[*]One thing you might need a guide for though, is the collectibles. I think there are four types of collectibles in the game, but there may be others that I just never saw. Seemingly they\u2019re tied to most of the game\u2019s achievements, as beating the game only got me 8/31. I\u2019m usually not interested in collectibles, but I am actually interested in going back through to try and get some/all of them, which is a rarity in games. I think it adds some good replayability, especially if you\u2019re a die-hard achievement hunter.\n\n[*]There are some dangers in Rime, I won\u2019t go into detail about what the dangers are lest I spoil the game, but I was glad to see a little danger thrown in, just to add some tension to the game. Though even with the tension in some parts, Rime is still a pretty relaxing game and I really enjoyed just sitting back and playing through it, it\u2019s a good experience.\n\n[*]I think the story is quite good, there\u2019s some mystery that kind of strings you along through the game, and then once you see the ending of the game the story of the whole game is revealed to you. I don\u2019t want to say too much more than that, so I don\u2019t spoil it, but I felt satisfied by the ending. I think a second playthrough is probably required to make sense of everything though, as there are a couple of things I\u2019m left confused by.[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral:[/h1]\n[list][*]One thing that I noticed other reviews picking up on is the climbing mechanics in the game, with that being mentioned in some of the negative reviews. I don\u2019t really understand why this was an issue for some people, because while it wasn\u2019t quite as interesting as something like Grow Home, it felt like it worked similarly to an Assassins Creed or Tomb Raider game to me (just with a little less animation). This is an adventure game rather than a climbing-focused game after all, so I think what\u2019s there is about as good as I would expect it to be.[/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives:[/h1]\n[list][*]My biggest disappointment with Rime was that it doesn\u2019t have a photo mode. This game is beautiful, and it\u2019s exactly the kind of game that a photo mode would work really well for. I get that this probably isn\u2019t a huge issue for everyone, but I was definitely disappointed by it.\n\n[*]Performance wasn\u2019t quite as good as I expected, I had to turn the settings down a fair bit more than I would have liked and even then, it wasn\u2019t running great. The visuals are great, but the game is simplistic and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s photo-realistic, I expected it to be easier to run. Probably not an issue for people with beefy rigs, but if you\u2019re on a mid-range gaming laptop or PC like I am, it might be worth keeping in mind.\n\n[*]There was a little too much underwater stuff for my liking. Rime really doesn\u2019t look anywhere near as nice or play as well during the underwater sections, and while I really enjoyed the rest of the game, I could not wait for the underwater sections to be over with.[/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\n\nI ended up enjoying Rime a lot more than I expected. It's a relaxing journey through some beautiful places, but don't come here looking for a challenge. It's worth playing through at least once. However, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything here that makes this game worth $30, I\u2019d wait for it to be $15 or less.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1550679633, "timestamp_updated": 1550679871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709112346172332764", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49113203": {"recommendationid": "49113203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995328460", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1550656835}, "language": "english", "review": "A very attractive looking game, lovely visuals and soundscape.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty simplistic and at times progress is tedious and non-rewarding.\nControls (x-box) are quite reasonable but occasionally the swimming movement of the camera can be annoying\nIt's okay, worth a few bucks and a few hours of play.", "timestamp_created": 1550638246, "timestamp_updated": 1550638246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49099622": {"recommendationid": "49099622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128383171", "num_games_owned": 603, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 529, "last_played": 1550577737}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorgeous and relaxing game.\nPlatformer with simple puzzles, focusing on an emotional story accompanied by beautiful music.", "timestamp_created": 1550579230, "timestamp_updated": 1550579230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49073566": {"recommendationid": "49073566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154854885", "num_games_owned": 1107, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 646, "last_played": 1550516177}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]RiME: m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las palabras[/h1]\n[u]Rese\u00f1a Spoiler-free[/u]\n\nSi tuviera que describir este juego con una sola palabra ser\u00eda [b]hermoso[/b].

So just trust me, its good.\n\nRiME is an artistic masterpiece. Each individual level has distinct moods.

When you finish the game, and understand the story, the levels feel so much better designed now that you know what they are meant to be. \n\nThe puzzles may have been simple, but I felt like the increase of complexity was smooth. It introduced the new concepts fast enough to keep the simple game play from stagnating. \nIt is NOT like other puzzle games like \"Portal\" where you might spend ages in a single room.

Yes, Rime does all the stuff that puzzle-platformers do: you explore various worlds, scale walls, navigate mazes, all the while solving puzzles to unlock areas. The puzzles were mostly fun to solve, although most of them were not difficult, actually some were even very straightforward. However, the main purpose of Rime is to tell you a story, the puzzle solving business is totally secondary. And that story is very intriguing. I completed the game in just two long nightly sessions, so curious was I to see the story unfold. The backstory is unclear when you start to play the game. The game consists of 5 chapters with very different moods and atmospheres. As the names of the 5 chapters indicate, the game is about dealing with loss. But only in the final chapter the backstory of the boy is finally revealed.\n\nApart from the story, there is much to like about Rime. To me one of the main attractions of the game is the art and visual style of the game. Each world is very beautiful and well designed, with the exception of the various extensive underwater scenes (with the air bubbles) which appear to be a tribute to Super Mario Galaxy. The character controls pretty well and runs reasonable fast, which is very important in this game as you do not want the platforming to get in the way of the story telling. In some parts of the game you are climbing massive walls and structures, which was actually fun to do because the character handles so well.", "timestamp_created": 1548884734, "timestamp_updated": 1548884734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588192284107208252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48651384": {"recommendationid": "48651384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034840259", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 409, "last_played": 1661551914}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece.

This game is more about the experience and story than pure gameplay fun. There is some stuff to collect and complete,\nbut i must be very honest about that it is not a lot of fun to do so. The game is level based, so you will have to replay a complete level again to collect missed stuff, which can take up to an hour.

The final two chapers are the ultimate showcase of this, as a combination of environmental choices along with music that makes you feel the anguish of the boy, are pulled off to perfection. The game shines with it's style, music, and subtle storytelling, and it's entirely why I recommend you play it.\n\nThe Not So Good:\nThe puzzles are fine, but they're not really anything special. That said, I knew I was coming in to this for the look and sound of it, and less so for the actual video game parts, so it's really not that big of a knock against it.\n\nThe only other thing that actually truly bothered me while playing, was some of the camera work. I don't usually feel motion sick playing games- I've got a Rift, and I can stay in that thing for hours- but for some reason, I found myself feeling kind of ill after certain sections of RiME.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n\nSo Act 1 starts off at a slow pace, easing you into the basic elements of gameplay. You don't feel any sort of rush to complete the main objective right away so you're more likely to explore (which is good as you will ABSOLUTELY need to do that in later levels just to finish the main objective). One element never gets used again (feeding the boars fruit) which is seriously dissapointing to me.\n\nAct 2 was INTENSE and I LOVED IT. I had all these good vibes going in and then the tone shift comes when a real enemy was introduced being the Bird(?) and the Phantoms. Now the thing with the bird is that I was expecting it to be the main antagonist for the whole game - not just one act. What I was expecting was finding out that this boy's tribe was responsible for destroying its home and the bird, in a continuous fit of anger, would attack their village. In order to appease it, they would offer a sacrifice - the boy - but something goes wrong. The boy survives and the bird is FURIOUS. He's now actively seeking out his meal and you must help this boy kill the bird and get to safety.\nThis is what I THOUGHT. But what I GOT was... well, like I said, it would've been good had the gameplay not ruined it.\nThe only other comment I have for Act 2 is the realization that the Phantoms were afraid of me. I thought that was an amazing discovery. This entire time, I had been going out of my way to avoid them, scared of them myself, and these things are just as afraid of me? That was AWESOME. You're meant to be playing from the perspective of a boy adrift in a strange land, you have no idea what's going on and you're just trying your best to survive. Then these bizarre creatures show up on what you can only presume is their territory and THEY are afraid of YOU? \n\nAct 3: \nWell, I wish the last point would've standed because even after you managed to kill the largest creature in the immediate area, those phantoms make a complete 180 and COME for you. Personally, I think this should've been switched. They should've started off aggressive and THEN gone to fear. Part of my frustration with this act is having to take a guess at whether or not this phantom is only acting as a barrier or if they're actually aggressive. The other part is not having a god damn clue what I was doing. Apparently I'm not the only one because one of the most watched Walkthroughs spends a good 5-10 min on puzzle just walking around, trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Half of my time was spent going \" WELL HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT \" and grinding my teeth in anger. This is BAD for many reasons but the largest one is that it takes you out of the running story that's going on. Like when you see these giant Cores which look like the Steam Punk version of cores found in Portal just lying there dead, I get the impression I'm SUPPOSED to care. I'm SUPPOSED to care when the 1st one you revive suddenly collapses. I'm SUPPOSED to care when the 2nd one sees its fallen brother and wails. \nBut did I?\nNo. \nBecause by the time I got to the end of the level, I was too pissed off to care. This same problem dominates through the rest of the game which is awful when you're trying to tell an emotional story like this. There was also this one part where there was this wall that looked like it had a golden ladder.\nCouldn't climb it.\nMassively infuriating.\nYou can climb vines, pillars with golden rungs, and rock walls with a small jut but you can't climb something that looks like a ladder?\n\nAct 4:\nIdk if this is meant to split up into 2 acts after the boy turns into a ghost but I'm counting it as one so you're gonna have to deal with it.\nI was still pretty raw from anger coming into this and thought that this might be the Act I settle down but I was INSTANTLY enraged when I saw the robots were carrying the kid.\nWhy?\nBECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO USEFUL IN THE LAST DAMN CHAPTER, THAT'S WHY.\nYou gotta think before you do shit like this because I spent the majority of Act 3 glaring at this robot thinking \" Why can't I just hold onto your leg or something and pilot you? \"\nAnyhow, the rest of the level was fine until midway through. One of the totems I needed to activate had the most infuriating platform sequences since the cliff I needed to grab was at a weird angle. The character is easy enough to control with just about any situation EXCEPT diagonal jumping. I had to make 5 attempts before making what should have been a relatively easy jump.\nThe final thing that ticked me right off was when the kid becomes a ghost.\nDO. NOT. MAKE. YOUR. CHARACTER. THE. SAME. COLOR. AS. THE. PLATFORMS. OH. MY. GOD.\nThat was an AWFUL design choice. It's not pleasing to look at and it makes controller the character harder. \n\n4/10.

But god did they completely screw up secret/achievement hunting here. You can only select the start of each chapter, and there's points of no return all throughout chapters, meaning that secrets are easy to miss and then take a looong time to get back to if you do miss them. Which is bad. And they all do... nothing, really. Emblems mean nothing. Lullabies mean nothing. Toys and Keyholes have tiiiiny rewards but nooot really. Outfits are the only tangible reward and they're only aesthetic at best. And the way some stuff is hidden is... questionable. Go through a specific set of doors? Uhh. Climb a tower you already climbed but with no indication you need to climb it again? Why. \n\nThe problem you face whether or not you go for completion is that this game is self-indulgent to the point of arrogance and thus looooves wasting your time. Be prepared for: 1. Slooow cutscenes. 2. Slow movement. 3. Lots of samey, uninteresting parkour platforming. 4. A general super slow feel. It's just... paced really badly and on replay (which is almost a necessity if you want to go for completion considering how easy it is to miss stuff) it reeeally shows how much this game revels in its own \"atmosphere\" and \"beauty\". Yeah, the game does look good. But not -that- good. Not so good you need to constantly shove it in my face. The music's also a tad generic but constantly seems to believe it's meaningful and deep. Bleh.\n\nI will say, the story is solid, and it's revealed at a decent enough pace, though really they could've told the same story more succinctly and cut out a lot of the tedious puzzling. But ehh.

You are in character like Tomb Raider. You jump from ledges and hurdle across casms and climb VERY high. I say this because I have a fear of heights. My games that terrifed me; were like Dying Lights First encounter with the Crane off the roof. I nearly hurled. After you get used to it its alright, and this game delivers that sense of height and risk.\n\nThe controls are very tight.\n \nI am a WASD player, casual gamer. The controls having sensitivity is crucial because the game will kill you for jumping. Falling works in the game, and there IS gravity.\n\nI found the situations and scenery made the game play all the more fun. As you go, youre able to collect things, There are shells, pieces of images, pictures keyholes, and some other things I cant remember. This game was LUSHLY populated with Lovely, and harsh landscapes.[/H1]\n\n[H1]Look and feel:[/H1]\n[H1]I loved the simple beauty of the character, there was a childlike innnocence you saw. The enviroments were Lush. I loved how things interact with you. In a sandbox Open-world, I can go anywhere,  this game was fairly forgiving and allowed me to get out of jams, unlike some games do. The walls and rocks arent Traps like Other games, in other words.\n\nI played this game for 3 days on a off. I tried to play to a stopping place and save. The game saves but its Usually where you started from, the last time you played. That Isnt a big deal because I saw how I needed to go sometimes when I was lost. Starting again helped me get my bearings.\n\nThe Puzzles are Great and varied. There are so many I couldnt count, but you were always involved. It was my Favorite part of this game.\n\nParker moves and jumping happens also.[/H1]\n\n[H1]Likes:[/H1] \n\n[H1]The look wasnt so polished you were awestruck at every scene, but the graphics were (in Ultra) Beautiful. Physics are real and consisistent, as are response from controls.\nThe cut-scenes are a treat, and happen so infrequently its a great break in the action. It slows the play down too. Thats a deal because I found myself wanting to run through the game. I sort of Did, but in a thoughtful manner, trying to find stuff and get achievments.[/H1]\n\n[H1]Dislikes:[/H1]\n\n[H1]This game is Stingy with achievments if youre a collector of stuff. The artifacts to find, go from difficullt, to stupidly simple.\nNot the strongest part of the game IMHO to complete. This requires a guide to find everthing.\n\nAt times I found my self having issues with what was being asked of me or where I was going (because I have a tendancy to wander in open world games like this, and I was lost a few times. Luckily the Devs had a Clue, and made it so if you save; it will allow you to return to the start of your mission. \n\nYou have a traveling companion, a Fox. It willl lead you where you need to go. I had to pay attention to that, because its Really handy Not to get lost.\nIm not a completionist.[/H1]\n\n[H1]Final thoughts:[/H1]\n\n[H1]I like to start at a place where everyone can agree, 'would you play this game again?'\nI have to say, 'Yes'.\nIm a sucker for games that allow me to run around everywhere and do mostly anything.\nI liked the Puzzles in this game!! I like puzzles, but this game had great Logical puzzles, and it made sense when you finished them. Plus: You feel smarter.[/H1]\n\n[H1]8/10 Beauty, because the graphics werent SO polished, but still lovely.\n      9/10 Game play: It Was fun!\n      10/10 Immersion, because at the end[spoiler]I cried[/spoiler][/H1]\n\n[H1]The price is Right to get this, during a sale, so Please do.

Rimes concept of an exploration game with epic puzzles is a great idea and you will feel like thats what your getting in the begining which sadly is as far as most people get with there games as seen with low achivement rates.\n\nBut sadly this game is full of frustrating flaws and outright incompetance at the hands of the designer and even the artists which is very poor by todays standards. This game is overall a simple design for the unreal engine which was speically built to make these kind of single player games great unlike PUBG etc but boy does it have problems. \n\nFirstly this game has one of the worst camera clipping issues I have seen that causes the camera to jarringly go through walls often stunning the player with black or worse whatever randomness is behind the games walls. Its like being blinded everytime as if a deer just dove out in front of your car, truly awful programing. Plently of unreal engine games dont have any issue with the camera like this its something you dont even think about in Tomb Raider for example. \n\nTomb raider is a good thing to compare alot of things in this game as despite its faults its fundemntals are solid when compared to Rimes poor effort. Alot of the climbing in this game is based on bird shit on ledges signalling you can climb it but due to the artistic lighting you often can not see it. Now i don't wear glasses but if you do dont even finish the review just dont bother with the game youre going to rage often trying to figure out what youre missing when you can see the slight change in color that was vital to you progressing forward. The lighting in general makes the game such an awful experince espically the areas that are dark and due to the high washed out light in the day you cant fix it with brightness changes unless you plan to turn it up and down everytime you in an area which somethings if your moving like underwater for example its too risky to do so.\n\nThe parkour in general in this game is often terrible when compared to Tomb raider or Assasins creed and thers a distinct lack of smoothness to the animations and controls which make navigating the world a chore. The little boys animations are so janky and stilted as if he has brittle bones, it feels like every button press has animation delay which makes timing what you want to do bad. I died a few times jumping off a cliff when I wasnt intending to do what the game produced. The game is also very inconsistent with what is possible, yes I know you could make that jump back then but you can't here ... or can you its never clear whats possible or if your doing it wrong. I really wish they had implemtned the fox guide more to aliveate this.\n\nThe boy chacters design starts to anoy after you spend enough time with him as hes just so odd looking imagine a white kid with black face thats strangely what he looks like. The dumb thing to me is why there wasnt a character creation tool in this game as the story is so loose that being a girl or a boy of whatever race would have not effected the plot. Being able to create you as a child would have added a lot of depth to the game and made it more meaningful because after a while youll be flinging him off cliffs just to see whats possible without a care in the world, meaning you dont care for his saftey and therefore his journey. \n\nThe puzzles arent really that speical, there often beautiful in there architetureal design and art which is one of the games big draws but there's nothing hear thats better than the Breath of the Wild mini puzzles. Im not the biggest fan of Tomb raider or Uncharted but I can promise you they both have far better puzzles. One that particular pissed me off was one of the gold door ones that asks the player to know how to do something thats impossible within the games logic until you learn of it. Soon as you know its possible the puzzle is easy if you don't you'll feel like you dont even have a clue as to not only what to do but if your even in the right place, its that fucking awful. 1 of the worse puzzles I've seen made, thats similar to telling the player I know you have 2 hands but you should have used the invisble 3rd hand we gave you but didnt tell you.\n\nAnother thing mentioned by reviewer Jim Sterling really hit home the more i played the game and thats the problem of having collectables which are an issue for several reasons in this specific game. Firstly they are mostly apart from the story ones worthless and unrewarding items that make you feel like that was pointless for my time investment. Theyre kind of a nod towards those that explore a little more than others whilst doing the main ones but it just makes you feel like checking every nook for the sake of it not because you want to. Thats bad because exploration is what makes this game feel unique and special yet often youre exploration is not rewarded because instead of something like a beautiful hidden waterfall with unique life, you find a worthless charm thats more like an emoticon than anything else. The game really needed more animal life and a way for the boy to interact with it in an enjoyable way like petting it for example. \n\nThe music is nice but kind of forgettable you want really be hearing it in your head later on but its not anoying unlike many of the sound effects from the shouting boy to the segul to the hellish bird boss scream. I turned the sound down more and more that I pushed through the game, shame.\n\nThe game runs very poorly on my powerful computer for a game this simple and it feels very poorly optomised. This is really bad given you kinda need the graphics on high to see things clearly due to the previously mentioned problems with the game. Even though the game looks simple enough if you have a low end system really do not bother with this game its going to be troublesome for you. I also hate the lack of being able to save when you want its really jarring when you have to come back to the game as your not where youd like to pause your journey. The options menu is very poor by Total Biscuits standards and pc buffs are not going to be impressed by whats here.\n\nOverall this game is not worth the high price for a short indie game and even at sale due to its painfully frustrating elements I can not recomend you spend your time with this game. The sad part about this game is that if they had a team of testers or went early access that would have spotted all these obvious issues with the game and lead to them being fixed. A lot of what this game does has been done before but better and its a real shame the game designers didnt study hard enough to learn about the importance of customer feedback in design. Their lack of expertise has turned what could have been a great title into a bad one and how sad it is that all the hard work they put into this game is wasted.  \n\nThe main lesson here is Hire Quality Assurance Testers no matter what your games budget is, pls Devs.", "timestamp_created": 1545802140, "timestamp_updated": 1545802527, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.386661648750305176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47807173": {"recommendationid": "47807173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076099664", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 356, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 369, "last_played": 1545707797}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Dude varias veces de comprar este juego, pensando que seria un juego sin audio el cual te aburrir\u00eda, pero me equivoque, desde el inicio me encanto esos colores, los rompecabezas la jugabilidad estilo tomb raider, poco a poco te va sumergiendo en historia y literalmente tambi\u00e9n XD, lo Recomiendo, Excelente juego.\n\nVoces: Ninguno\nTexto: Espa\u00f1ol\n\n****An\u00e1lisis*****\n*Jugabilidad: Excelente\n*Un Jugador : Excelente\n*Campa\u00f1a Horas: Bueno\n*Rompecabezas : Muy Bueno\n*Graficas: Excelente\n\nCalificacion: 8.4\n\nNota+Definicion: 10=Obra Maestra, 9=Excelente,8=Muy Bueno, 7=Bueno, 6=Medio Bueno, 5=Mejorable, 4= Mediocre, 3=Malo, 2=Muy Malo, 1=Inservible", "timestamp_created": 1545748036, "timestamp_updated": 1608910247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201315879821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47790531": {"recommendationid": "47790531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192302882", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 481, "last_played": 1545606196}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the best screaming-at-things simulator there is.\n", "timestamp_created": 1545689976, "timestamp_updated": 1545689976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57007068395614624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47781455": {"recommendationid": "47781455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989693118", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1546986409}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Yo no s\u00e9 las pel\u00edculas que se han montado con el juego este y sus significados ocultos, si no hay misterio.

Pues pongo algunos ejemplos:\n\nEn un inicio llegamos a Mojacar, donde encontramos todas esas calles y casas blancas revestidas de cal (ya sab\u00e9is, para estar fresquitos en verano), visitamos tambi\u00e9n la playa de Punta Paloma, con sus aguas cristalinas y su maravillosa orilla en la que buscar fardos y, m\u00e1s tarde, nos adentramos en terrenos monta\u00f1osos, concretamente en M\u00e1laga, donde casi al final del juego puedes encontrar el caminito del rey.\n\nEs cierto eso de que es muy importante la voz del protagonista. Y es que en tu viaje deber\u00e1s aprender a cantar sole\u00e1s, t\u00edmidamente empezar\u00e1s con suaves \u201cmmmh\u201d que avanzar\u00e1n directamente a gritos porque no terminas bien de pillar el comp\u00e1s, y claro, eso te descarta autom\u00e1ticamente como cantante pero te vale para el jaleo.\n\nOtra referencia clara es cuando, en un momento del juego en el que todo est\u00e1 oscuro, se te aparece la virgen de la macarena para darte fuerza cristiana, pero al verte se raya y desaparece porque sabe que no est\u00e1s bautizao.\n\nEl zorro ese que no hace m\u00e1s que ronearte es en realidad el chivato del dealer del barrio. Uno que va con un poncho rojo y que est\u00e1 en todos los rincones del juego porque cambia continuamente de lugar no vaya a ser que los verdes le desmonten el tinglao.\n\nY bueno a\u00fan me queda juego por delante as\u00ed que si veo m\u00e1s referencias ir\u00e9 actualizando esto.

Puzzles are just .. bad.. They don't have any real cleverness to any of them, at least for the player. It's all trial and error. The game just wants to show off its artistry at every point, which I admit is top notch and the game is absolutely beautiful. But with some clunky controls and poor puzzles, this is definitely a thumb down for me. Also has optimization issues. Stutters sometimes in some areas even on a Vega 64.\n\nThe game clearly takes inspiration from third person action adventure games like the classic Prince of Persia / Tomb Raider /God of War / Darksiders. Except, they have meaning to exploration, have great puzzles, much better level design, and good combat as well. Granted this is a chill-out and relax game,  but it fails even in that department because some of the puzzles are just annoying -they don't really require much use of your brain, but just trial and error.. If the puzzles were actually clever, like what you see in Talos Principle or Portal, I would've absolutely recommended this game. But, they're just mind numbingly boring to solve.. If you've played Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice, you'd know what I'm talking about. In Rime, puzzles are basically align an object with another,  rotate a ball till you hit the right spot, adjust an object so the shadows fall in the right places, so on and so forth. Sure, these puzzles show off a great lighting system and the developer's artistry skills, but as puzzles, they are barebones, yet frustrating at times, and it simply ruins it from being a good walking simulator as well.\n\nThis game has you pushing the Left analog stick on your controller forward (or pressing and holding W) for 80% of the game. It is a small open world, but your hand is still held by your pet which guides you to your objective. \n\nThere is immense beauty on first look, but without any real content or meaning to it, it's nothing but a pretty empty shell that fails to keep me hooked.. There is no real story until the epilogue of the game, but by that time, I was already frustrated with the game that I truly didn't care..

The game is emersive and tells an interesting story without the need for narration. Although RiME has some issues, it is certianly a game that I enjoyed and would recommend to people who love going on a story-telling journey.\n\n[h1] Puzzles [/h1] \nThis game is more of an art piece. The puzzles aren't meant to be challenging, but are meant to take you through the environment you're in. There are different puzzle mechanics that get introduced throughout the game that keeps the game interesting without making the introduction of he new mechanics abrupt.\n\n[h1] Exploration [/h1]\nAlthough RiME may seem linear, the player still has the option to explore their surroundings, often finding secrets or collectables; which can provide some lore (but it's totally optional and you don't need to collect them). The game isn't fully open world as you cannot explore places that are in different chapters from the one the player is in.\n\n[h1] Music and Visuals [/h1]\nThe music in this game was breathtaking and the visuals were superb. The music for each setting really added to the atmosphere of the game; making you feel wonder at some times and fear at others. The art style is fitting for the story the game is telling and the visuals look really good in game. Giant structures would be imposing and the creatures within the game looked rather cute.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nYou uncover the story about the boy and the island as you progress through the game. Telling the story through the environment and symbolism rather than narration is, although not a new concept, very effective in RiME. The story is left up to interpretation by the player which makes it all the more interesting. As I was playing, I felt as though the story was pulling me in; I wanted to know more about where it was going which lead me to progressing throughout the entire game.\n*In my opinion, the first 30 minutes of the game was to get the player used to the types of puzzles and mechanics that would be seen throughout the game. The story in this part of the game is not very apparent. However, RiME becomes much more interesting past this part and has good pace throughout the rest of the game*\n\n[h1] Controls and Mechanics [/h1]\nThe controls are reletively simple, and the game would often prompt you as to what button you need to press to do something (e.g interact, throw, s c r e a m).  The player mechanics are just your average jump, drop, climb and scream. These mechanics can be a little janky though, at times I would be jumping to a climbable plank above me and I would fall instead of grabbing on. Climbable wouldn't be climbable past a certian point, which required me to get off and get back on again. The animation when jumping up a small ledge was a little awkward too, the boy would just look like he was sliding towards the ledge. You would also have to wait for a previous animation to end before screaming at something as well. Overall, platforming wasn't too difficult, it's just sometimes these awkward mishaps can be a litle annoying. \n\n[h1] Performance [/h1]\nI would often drop frames in some areas for no particular reason and the game crashed twice in the 4.5 hours of playing even with the recommended specs.\n\n[h1] Pricing [/h1]\nI do understand that this is an indie game however $40 is pretty expensive for what you get out of the 5 hour game. I recommend buying RiME while on it's on sale (I got it for $20)\n\n[h1] Conclusion and Recommendation [/h1]\nIn conclusion, RiME does have a couple of issues but overall it is an amazing experience and remains emersive throughout. The visuals and music help create the environment and atmosphere the player is in and it tells an interesting story. I don't think RiME is for everyone though, I recommend it to people who appreciate games that are there to take you on a journey and allow you to experience a story (or people who have free time and money to spend).", "timestamp_created": 1544463320, "timestamp_updated": 1544522726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590163946151733398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47438577": {"recommendationid": "47438577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015965166", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 843, "last_played": 1544709020}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una vez que he acabado con el juego solo puedo decir cosas buenas sobre el. \n\nUn juego de plataformas bastante currado y entretenido, con una jugabilidad incre\u00edble que te har\u00e1 que disfrutes de cada minuto que pases con el.

I mention Journey because it was the first game like this that I got to experience first-hand. It is still one of my favorites, but I gotta say Rime grabbed my heart and squeezed more than Journey ever managed to do. \n\nI expected a quiet, beautiful puzzle game, which it ultimately was. But the emotional journey I went on was neither quiet nor beautiful considering I sat through the last minutes of the game as well as the end credits bawling my eyes out and slobbering all over my keyboard. I cry all the time, but you know something messed you up real bad when your nose clogs up and the tears mix with your snot (TMI I know). \n\nThe level design was fantastic, both in the way the world was built and the puzzles. The game used subtle visual, auricular and narrative queues to guide you and every feature immersed you in the experience. It used a lot of classic concepts that, as a gamer, you are very familiar with, but in a way that made them feel unique and interesting. I loved all the shaders and VFX. The feature that allowed you to sing and hum and cower and cry depending on your surroundings was absolutely fantastic. When I got to the dark room where you lit a path by singing, the subtle melody of the boy's voice instantly brought tears to my eyes and it continued to do so throughout the game. The music and soundeffects took the game to a completely different level.\n\nI was constantly amazed by the beauty of each area, my favorite being the [spoiler] beginning of Bargaining, the swampy area. I especially enjoyed the part where you walk through one door and without walking up any stairs arrive at another floor, and when you take the same route again end up somewhere completely different. And the part where you walk and walk but never get anywhere (although it was a little buggy). It felt like the game was playing with you. \n\nThe whole five stages of grief thing was fantastic and you could see signs of each stage in everything about each level. The mood, the progression, the way you interacted with the world, the way the boy acted etc etc. The symbolism was brilliant in both the holistic experience and in the little details. And in the end when you finally realized the truth it hit you like a bag of bricks. /[/spoiler]\n\nI bought this game during Black friday which means it was heavily discounted, but for everyone that missed that I would 100% buy this game for the full price. I didn't go out of my way to get any of the collectibles but it still took me 12+ hours to get to the end. This game will touch you in a way that feels personal and intimate, and that is a very rare and precious thing. I highly recommend it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1544373821, "timestamp_updated": 1544373821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47420378": {"recommendationid": "47420378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024923179", "num_games_owned": 656, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 840, "last_played": 1544372566}, "language": "english", "review": "Strong story, not so strong on the puzzle side.

I strongly recommend it for [I]people like me[/I], realizing fully that others might find it boring and confusing.\n\nThe gameplay is generally linear but gives you as much time as you'd like to explore each level. There are environmental puzzles: not too challenging and yet still satisfyingly composed. And yet the puzzles are more like focal points for your attention, small moments along a grand path. The true core of the gameplay is exploration.\n\nExploration is rewarding. The levels are beautifully designed, and there are nooks and crannies from which you can peek at familiar vistas from new angles. Many people who dislike the gameplay still admit that it's visually breathtaking. And there are small secrets (collectibles) to be found for meaningful achievements. (You can return and collect all of them after you've finished the game, so don't fret.)\n\nThe unspoken narrative is more of a loose poem than tight prose, even though it does coalesce in the end. You can assemble meanings and feelings yourself or read that interview with Ra\u00fal Rubio Mun\u00e1rriz in which he explains the basic intent. But he was just one person on the dev team, and there are many layers. Good art can evoke many perspectives.\n\nSome have reviewed this game as being boring and tritely sentimental. I can't argue against taste, but it seems that I value the things they find unimportant. Some say  a pale imitation of [I]Ico[/I], a game that likely inspired it. Well, I recently played [I]Ico[/I] on the PlayStation 2, and RiME is a vast improvement. It has more imaginative and diverse levels, more satisfying puzzles, and a more creative story. It's funny how nostalgia makes old games seem better than they are.\n\nFinally, some criticism. What I can say is that [I]Ico[/I] achieved a lot with very little, and sometimes [I]RiME[/I] can seem too lush and crammed with ideas. It's a nice long game, but perhaps it would have been more poignant if it were more compact, the themes drawn together a bit more starkly.\n\nAnd as many have pointed out, the game has technical difficulties. Frame rates are not great even on high-end hardware. You can overcome stuttering by reducing the graphics quality and even the resolution. The game will still be beautiful, trust me.

I will be reviewing the game in a pro/ con style and end with my conclusion.\n\nPro:\n     The graphics are beautiful. The game has a simplistic style that looks similar to journey, a cartoon like fantasy design for both worlds and characters. It kinda looks like zelda in a way.\n\n     Gameplay is very nice. It is a platformer just like journey on PSN. There are a few puzzles that are not too hard but does compliment platforming parts quite often.\n\n     Music is magic. Again you can not expect anything but the best emotional music from a game that is similar to journey. The music is used to protray mood of the characters or to add a layer of depth in the world with the ambient audio. The sound effects are pretty one point too.\n\n     Story is super. The story is told through both cutscene and music. The game goes the path of show not tell which leads to quite a theatrical experience where your not being told how to feel or whats going on. The story is told with 0 dialogue and like ive been saying a thousand times, just like journey. There is more emotional impact that a player feels with the show not tell tactic in games.\n\nConclusion:\n     Fime is a super game, you can see a good emotional story experience. Just like journey on PSN the game is an emotional rollercoaster and is worth playing from start to finish. Each stage in the game is unique and the music compliments both the world and the emotional impact of the game.

This did not bother me so much because I was more interested in the story unfolding as I progressed through the game.  The puzzles are there, not to make you think, but to suggest things about the plot unfolding before you.  The visuals and the settings are superb in conveying a particular mood, and the mood changes as you progress.

The whole premise is really simple: your playable character is a kid who find himself cast away on a seemingly deserted island filled with the ruins of a civilization long gone. He must proceed to navigate the (at times) dangerous new environment with the help of a magical fox companion in order to find a way to escape.\n\nIt's pretty clear that the developers took a lot of gameplay and atmosphere clues from the Team ICO games. Putting aside the premise itself and the design of pretty much everyone and everything, the gameplay is all about leading your young protagonist throught the various, breath-taking areas and solve some puzzles or otherwise manipulate the environment in order to escape danger or to advance.\n\nWhile RiME doesn't reach the unforgettable status of its inspiration, the result is still a really enjoyable experience. The gameplay is simple yet enjoyable and the controls, especially during the purest platforming sequences, are comfortable, at the very least most of the time. The puzzles you are presented along the journey aren't especially hard, but they are varied and entertaining enough in their own right. The atmosphere, the characters and the minimalist, cartoony art style are most definitely endearing and make go throught the game a very enjoyable and relaxing experience. It also helps that the areas after the first one, the Island proper, are varied enough and each feature its own theme and elements. The soundtrack also enhances the mood perfectly.\n\nRiME's major drawback is most definitely its kinda short lenght: an average player will be able to complete it in under five hours or so.

I thought about dropping a bad review, but that would not be fair. I finished RiME in round about 8 hours. And I loved it for seven of those. \n\nIt all starts with a young boy waking up at the beach of a mysterious, foreign land. There are no other people, but old, ancient ruins. So we have our lad run about Tomb Raider style, jumping, climbing, swimming, diving, solving puzzles and riddles, trying to find out where we are.\n\nThis journey is a most beautiful one. The graphic style is simple, but colorful and very well made. It reminds of The Witness and Firewatch. Not one word is spoken throughout the game, the whole story is being told through pictures. Lovely nature sounds and an orchestral sound track wonderfully add to the atmosphere.\n\nWhat seriously spoiled the game for me was the ending. I can not go too deep into detail, but I believe it's safe to say that at the end, nothing of the bright happiness is left. Watch the trailers on Steam. They show how the game begins. The ending will be the total opposite. The trailers make RiME appear as the perfect puzzle game for the entire family, your kids included, and YES for the very most part it actually is! The puzzles are not really challenging, the world, the young boy, the little fox, everything is super cute and there will be a lot of bright smiles while you play. Just if you let your kids play RiME, pray that they never make it to the end.  Or have paper tissues ready. \n\nThis is not what I expected from reading the game description or watching the trailers and I feel a bit betrayed. I believe finishing a game should leave you satisfied. Yes, some games have sad endings, some games have a dark theme too so that you are prepared for what there is to come. And even sad endings can be positive in a way.  But RiME just left me sad and empty. I hoped that after the credits there would be something, a hint, a picture, anything that would make me feel better, but there was nothing. Yes. yes. I do understand the message behind the story.

There is a lot to said about its amazing scenery and mysterious atmosphere.  However, the game falls short in player mechanics; particularly in its platforming.  \n\nIn many 3D games, the camera view is located behind the player, so controller movements align with character movements.  This alignment is important when navigating difficult environments such as a narrow bridge.  Sometimes a game will shift the camera view to better show off the scenery.  This view change can make platforming excruciatingly difficult when making jumps or walking across narrow paths.  Many games solve this problem by either locking movement controls to the character or making it impossible to fall off and fail.  \n\nRime has many narrow platforms and bridges where the camera shifts to an angled position rather than behind the character.  The camera sift causes most players to propel themselves off the bridge and to their deaths.  Furthermore, the save point is located behind the bridge, allowing the player to fail over and over.  Rime consistently changes the camera to an angled position, making it very difficult to platform.  \n\nThe second issue is running jumps.  Thirty minutes into the game, my character got stuck; unable to go forward or back.  I was in an area where I had to align three giant blue spheres.  To progress I had to make a running jump and hold onto a small ledge.  I failed the jump and fell onto the previous section.  However, the handholds leading up had been destroyed and my character became stuck.", "timestamp_created": 1543189512, "timestamp_updated": 1543189591, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46986414": {"recommendationid": "46986414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048888829", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1543182496}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Al escribir una rese\u00f1a de este juego me veo en la obligaci\u00f3n de separar dos elementos:\n[list]\n    [*][b]Referencias:[/b] \nEl juego bebe much\u00edsimo de dos juegos, que son los del Team ICO y Journey. Ahora bien, con esto no me refiero a que una lo mejor de los dos, si no que simplemente se dedica a [i]tomar prestados[/i] ciertos elementos para un uso mayoritariamente est\u00e9tico. De journey toma cosas como el hecho de haber varios personajes con capa en el que es la propia capa el elemento distinguible y el hecho de mostrarte repetidas veces el lugar que debes alcanzar (la torre en este caso, lo que ser\u00eda la monta\u00f1a de Journey). Esto podr\u00edan ser un par de detalles tontos, pero con los del team ICO es directamente un despiporre: el protagonista lleva una especie de capa, el juego transcurre en unas ruinas en islas rodeadas de agua, las playas, hay varios puentes laaaaaargos y estrechos, los molinos (no hab\u00eda suficiente con uno y por eso han metido tres), los enemigos son sombras, [spoiler] en la canci\u00f3n hablan de un chico de luz, que al final muere y se torna todo oscuro, como una sombra (\u00bfYorda, est\u00e1s ah\u00ed?)[/spoiler], el prota es un ser indefenso, en ocasiones vas acompa\u00f1ado de otro personaje controlado por la IA que va abriendo puertas y con el que intentan que te encari\u00f1es... de verdad creo que se han pasado, especialmente cuando, como digo, la mayor\u00e1 son cuestiones est\u00e9ticas, ni el juego va de lo mismo y ni mucho menos consigue lo mismo.\n\n    [*][b]El juego en s\u00ed:[/b] \nAhora s\u00ed que s\u00ed, vamos a lo m\u00e1s importante. El resumen es que el juego est\u00e1 bien. Empieza bien, luego afloja un poco y el final est\u00e1 bastante cuidado, as\u00ed que deja buen sabor de boca. Jugablemente es una mezcla de walking simulator con alg\u00fan objetivo (estilo Journey), mezclado con aventura ligera como ICO (con puzzles que est\u00e1n bien, te puedes atascar en alguno incluso) y cierto plataformeo guionizado como podr\u00eda ser el de Uncharted o los nuevos Tomb Raider (s\u00ed, con color distintivo en las cornisas agarrables, exactamente igual). En cuanto al aspecto gr\u00e1fico de los escenarios, el juego cumple de sobra: es bonito, result\u00f3n y cre\u00edble. Adem\u00e1s, el hecho de ofrecer un ambiente mediterr\u00e1neo, relativamente infrecuente en este medio audiovisual, me parece un punto muy a remarcar. Como detalles mejorables, los personajes me parecen feos con ganas (en cuanto a estilo), demasiado sencillos (en referencia a lo puramente t\u00e9cnico) y algunas de las animaciones dignas de un estudio indie de garaje (no todas, ojo, pero se podr\u00eda pulir bastante este tema). Y para acabar pero no menos importante, la banda sonora me ha gustado bastante. Menos en un par de ocasiones, es de tipo ambiental, no pretende que recuerdes las melod\u00edas ni que las vayas tatareando en el metro durante la semana siguiente, pero refuerzan contundentemente lo que se ve en pantalla. Y punto positivo a que el tema principal est\u00e9 cantado en castellano, \u00a1hay que reivindicar el producto patrio, que no vamos sobrados!\n[/list]\n\n[b]Conclusi\u00f3n: si ten\u00e9\u00eds posibilidad, jugad a Ios juegos del Team ICO, luego a Journey, y luego si quer\u00e9is ver un juego preciosista que remememora los dos anteriores de forma descafeinada, jugad a este, que no est\u00e1 mal.

Where Deadlight focused on shadows, darkness and despair, Rime is a constant play of warmth, light and affirmation. This can easily been seen in the games' lovely, bright visual style but also in the overall feel of the game. Rime made me think of huge personal favorites like Journey, ICO, A tale of Two Brothers and more recently the delightful Abzu. \n\nLike those games Rime tells a (mostly silent) story that ends up being so much more than just a series of environments to explore, obstacles to overcome or puzzles to solve. Without going into detail and spoiling the wonderful story, Rime made my heart ache and my soul soar. This is mostly attributed to the sublime soundtrack that accompanies the games most important scenes. \n\nDoes all that make Rime a perfect game? Unfortunatly not. The games two greatest flaws are the obtuse puzzles - which rarely go beyond pushing a button and carrying around a globe of light - and the jarring graphics. Even on my fairly powerful system I was constantly trying to ignore massive stuttering and jarring gameplay, which took away a fair bit of the enjoyment for me. \n\nIt's a huge shame, because with some more thoughtful puzzle design and variety, and a more stable engine, Rime could have been one of those perfect games for me.

This game told an amazing story, while applying in a puzzle-platformer game. However, the game itself doesn\u2019t really shine in gameplay. The puzzle feels weak, compare to other puzzle-platformer games such as Q.U.B.E. series and Portal series, where those games open up your imaginations in solving those puzzles. The platforming sometimes seems off too. There are cetain times where my protagonist just doesn\u2019t jump to where I want to. Precision is very important in platformer games, which is why Mario is always getting the praise. However, the graphics are suited for this game, and it unfolds a very strong story, make this game worth it. \n\nIt is better to wait for sale tho, if you are not sure of it.\n\n[h1] The story (Heavy spoiler ahead)\t[/h1]\n\nThe story starts off with a little boy wondering around, trying to seek for something. The true story slowly unfolds when the little boy progress. For people who had not yet finished or buy the game, please do not continue, this is all you need to know.\n\nFor people who had finished the game but unable to connect to the story, [spoiler] this is a story that talks about five stages of grief, in a very superb way. The little boy tries to seek for something, which I interpret as denial. The father is not accepting the death of his son during the sail. As such, everything is seems beautiful, nice and peaceful. Then, as the masking effect of denial starts to wear off, anger comes in. The \u201ceagle\u201d is the sign of anger. The metal ball is the sign of something important, and that the eagle, which representing the father, do not want to loss such important stuff/memories. As you progress in retrieving the metal ball, the \u201cfather\u201d is actually slowly wearing the anger stage, and going into bargaining. However, the bargaining stage didn\u2019t really show much from my point of view. The only significant sign is that there are times where you will see a red hood guy walks past in sight, but it slips quickly. The red hood guy is the \u201cfather\u201d. \u201cWhat if, I was there? What if, I was able to catch him?\t[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] As you reach to a statue where you have to activate 4 small statues, a \u201cdark aura\u201d strikes in the little boy, and started to walk very slow. This is the stage of \u201cdepression\u201d. His father, at this point, realise that his son is no longer here, despite he wished to. He starts to prepare a quiet preparation (the one-eyed robots), to accept this. As the robots starts unlocking the door, so does the \u201cdoor\u201d of his heart. In the end phrase, we see the real protagonist, the father, goes into his son room. The fox figurine is right there to remind that his son is gone, and is not coming back. He later on, let go of the red hood, which in fact was belong to his son.\t[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1542213782, "timestamp_updated": 1542824525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56445997953414917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45812324": {"recommendationid": "45812324", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999380987", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1469, "last_played": 1529483686}, "language": "english", "review": "Santa montica games, your company will always have a soft spot in my heart.

I came back to it a handful of times after having determined it wasn't for me just in case I'd find something amazing that would lead a total change of heart, but it didn't happen. Unfortunately, this is a game I'll have to write off as \"competent, but boring\". \n\nI'm sure the developers did a good job executing what they were going for, with a nice atmosphere, an adorable greek-ish graphical style, an understated melancholic and mysterious tone, and beautiful sprawling sceneries. I really wanted to like it because the main character really looks, sounds and acts in a likable manner, and the worlds are absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately, the game did not \"click\" with me. The sad music coupled with the slow pace and long sections of nothing but uneventful corridors and rooms made for a boring experience most of the time.\n\nAdmittedly, the first thing that disappointed me about this game is the gap between what I assumed the game was gonna be like and how it actually was. When I saw that the main character was a shipwrecked kid on an unknown island, I expected it to be more of an open world platformer, and was quickly proven wrong. Very little of the world is open to exploration at any given time, and optional branching paths tend to be short and lead only to optional collectibles, so the bulk of the game is mostly linear.  Say, the game's worlds are less like a large tree and its branches and more like a centipede and its feet, if that makes sense. I can't give the game crap for this, however, it's just a disconnect between my expectations and reality.\n\nStill, it doesn't help that the game pretty much punishes exploration in certain parts by making you backtrack through long obvious platforming sections if you drop down one too many tall ledges in search of secrets. I swear to god this happened to me like five times while exploring the desert world. I'd drop down a seemingly interesting path only to learn it took me back to the beginning of whatever structure I had to climb, forcing me to go a long way back up, at which point I'd just give up and walk towards my fox buddy to move on. Add to that the fact that pretty much every platforming section is an obvious zero-choice game of \"find the right thing to jump towards\" requiring no timing or skill, and you have a tedious platforming experience. Sure, one may claim that platforming is not the game's main focus, but it is still wide spread throughout the whole experience, serving as little more than a zero-stakes, zero-choice and often overlong bridge between the actually interesting bits.\n\nTo make matters worse, if you shut off the game and return to it later, you might have a hard time remembering where to go depending on where you left off, especially when the paths ahead are winding and confusing to navigate. I understand that the game does not have minimaps or pointers to avoid breaking immersion, but it'd still help to have something other than our yappy fox friend to guide us around, especially when the first thing we have to do after reloading the game is locate the bloody thing.\n\nDialog-free storytelling is all well and good, but after having watched a handful of cinematics and looked at some wall paintings and keyholes, all I gather is that we're a shipwrecked kid whose parents were some important folks, and the recurring pervert in the Little Red Riding Hood suit is apparently important too, as he's in our boat when it gets caught in a storm. In general, the game did not engage me enough for me to want to piece the story together. This game might contain a beautiful, deep, heart wrenching plot, but I'll never know because the game itself bored me. Maybe I'll watch a Let's Play one of these days, as having someone talking while playing feels like a sure fire way to keep it from making me fall asleep.\n\nAnyway, let's move on to the good bits, because I do think this game has many positive traits. In spite of the linearity, and the platforming being basic and uninteresting, the game has a ton of interesting puzzles and mechanics that make for short moments of genuine enjoyment amidst the overall dragging feeling that populates most of it. While the puzzles in the first island are rather simplistic, the ones in the second island are fun and interesting, giving me that \"eureka\" feeling when I figured them out. One mechanic that stood out to me was the damn bird thing that jumpscares you if you stay too long under the sun, like the world's most adamant skin cancer awareness activist, because it ramps up the stakes, making us carefully and meticulously plan our route forward to expose ourselves for as little time as possible as we walk from sheltered area to sheltered area. Probably the second most fun part of the game.\n\nAll that is brought down, however, by the fact that the paths connecting every good part of the game are mostly uneventful and occasionally outrageously long, being basically a \"press forward simulator\", except with you occasionally having to press buttons other than forward when navigating the aforementioned boring and simplistic platforming sections.\n\nAll in all, I was disengaged. I stopped playing after a while and didn't feel like coming back to it. The game has sudden spikes in engagement when we need to overcome an actual puzzle or challenge, but those are sparsely spread out amidst mostly linear and predictable walking, jumping and swimming sections with that droning sad music. The lullaby-ish soundtrack and lack of dialog makes those sections tedious as all hell.\n\nI really like what this game was setting out to do, but I think it took way too many liberties with the slow pace, large empty spaces, and scripted platforming sections. Maybe if there was a narrator with a deep voice or something, that might have gotten me engaged enough to plow through it, but I digress. Who knows, though, you might enjoy it more than I did, if you have a higher than average tolerance for the almost uninterrupted melancholic atmosphere, and a better brain than me to piece the story together. \n\nAll that being said, I do think this game is a valuable little piece of art. I may come back to it one day, probably to see if I can finally try piecing the story together. Who knows, I might start liking the game after that. So yeah, my opinion of this game is more \"mixed\" than \"negative\".", "timestamp_created": 1541655259, "timestamp_updated": 1542142279, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509828031063079834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45696242": {"recommendationid": "45696242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040399625", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 491, "last_played": 1690614607}, "language": "english", "review": "A marvelous game, with fantastic visuals, sound design, and music.

The music was what drew me initially to the game (even though the trailer was poorly made IMO), and I was not dissappointed. I savoured the lush moments of the music, and liked how it held back during most of the game to give greater impact to those special moments. I wish the music took a more unique route, especially as the game progressed, since its influences (Joe Hisaishi, Michael Nyman, etc.) were front-and-centre throughout the entire game.\n\nThough it has its flaws, overall, I highly recommend RiME.\n\nNB: The game requires a pretty decent graphics card to get the most out of the experience.", "timestamp_created": 1541652167, "timestamp_updated": 1541652591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45694552": {"recommendationid": "45694552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001251929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 167, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1541643091}, "language": "english", "review": "A unique game indeed \nMust play", "timestamp_created": 1541643140, "timestamp_updated": 1541643140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474999994039535522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45690537": {"recommendationid": "45690537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171801690", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1541622506}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you for such a beautiful expierence.", "timestamp_created": 1541622576, "timestamp_updated": 1543179787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45682840": {"recommendationid": "45682840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127133011", "num_games_owned": 1212, "num_reviews": 325, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1541594687}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Siempre parece que aunque en Espa\u00f1a hay un sector activo de videojuegos, no acaban de salir joyas indie del horno de hacer juegos.

The shouting is a form of interact that triggers the lamps and most things that have a slight glow at range, interact is used for moving blocks and picking up items. You will unlock a fox guide near the beginning of the game, and can help out with the story. The game is a railroaded story with no branches although there is plenty of space to explore for the hidden collectables. The achievements are mostly centered around exploration of the island and collecting of the optional collectables.\n\nDifficulty: Easy, there are two types of \u2018enemy\u2019 in the game and are both easy to avoid and one acts as more of an environmental hazard. The puzzles are straightforward and never leaves the player feeling stuck, some collectable are protected by slightly tougher puzzles but remain in the easy category. Hints larger scale puzzles are given on a will that the camera will lock onto in a mini cutscene upon entering the area or given as a vision when the way to the puzzle area is opened.\n\nStory: The games story of what is happening won't be revealed to the player until the end of the fourth chapter, until then it will raise more questions than answers. It is delivered without any dialogue making this game multilingual by default (except for the menu, credits and some hints) to offer any description of what the story is about would be an extreme spoiler. If you are the sort to allow yourself to get involved in the story/atmosphere of a game then have a box of tissues handy as the game has some sad moments around <Spoiler>.\n\nGraphics and sound: The sound will help draw you in and one set of collectables is the parts of a lullaby. Wildlife makes the appropriate sounds when required such that it blends into the location seamlessly. Visually the game is stunning with the settings maxed out with the various areas conveying the feel of the area and showing even small details like lizards on the walls, schools of fish in the sea\n\nLongevity: Rime a short game game that can be completed in about 8 hours for main story line and probably another 12 to get all the collectables. The game is replayable however if you want to recollect the collectable you will need to disable cloud save and delete the save file. Due to the nature of the story, expansions and direct sequels are highly improbable without sacrificing story quality.\n\nFinal verdict: An enjoyable game that will hit the feels right at the end.

While it's not quite as good as Ico itself is, it shares many characteristics of it (a puzzle platformer with no spoken dialogue in a beautiful setting laden with the feels).\n\nPuzzles are well designed, with a few core mechanics used consistently but with slightly different twists each time, so they are familiar enough to solve without getting boring.\n\nPlatforming is straightforward and forgiving; there's a few times you can get lost or miss the cues about where to go next, but the controls handle well and if you do miss a jump you're usually landed right back ready for another go without losing any progress.  (The jumps themselves tend to err on the forgiving side; on occasion your character will visibly not quite make the jump but the game will let you latch on and continue anyway rather than dropping you into the void.  I consider this a good thing.)  There are a few spots where it probably would have been better to use a controller (due to camera angles and needing to do the two-key running shuffle), but I played through using keyboard and mouse just fine.\n\nThe environments are beautiful (especially at the beginning, although later chapters are still beautiful in a different way).  The only downer here is that on my system (which is not the best, but is reasonably decent) there are quite a few spots where it's unable to maintain a stable 60 FPS, so wide angle camera motion in particular can sometimes suffer a bit.  As this only really happened during cinematic transitions it never particularly affected gameplay.\n\nThere is a definite story in the game, although it's one that's best experienced for yourself, and since it is of the \"silent but evocative\" type, in some cases each person might come away with a slightly different idea of what story it was actually telling, somewhat informed by their own experiences.  But this is fine, and as long as you see it through to the end (and avoid spoiling yourself beforehand) you should get something good out of it.  Several articles have been written based on interviews with the game's creators as well as other people's experiences of the story, but you really should try to avoid reading these until you've played it through at least once on your own.\n\nFor the explorers and completionists, it comes with a healthy number of hidden secrets, collectibles, and achievements, which you can either spend time hunting down on your first playthrough or use the Chapter Select feature to jump back later on to collect things you missed.  (There are only one or two things that are actually impossible to find on your first playthrough, although unless you're very thorough you're likely to miss quite a bit more than that.)\n\nOverall, again: if you like this sort of thing, you should play this.", "timestamp_created": 1541301424, "timestamp_updated": 1541301424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45612674": {"recommendationid": "45612674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092126420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 334, "last_played": 1541293621}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\nThe mix of story telling, puzzles, gameplay and strategy are on point.

And as more and more indie developers became enabled to use powerful engines that allow creating something mechanically simple, but beautiful and, hopefully, evocative, the amount of games of this type went up dramatically. RiME is just another example of this type of game. Made with lots of care, genuinely good looking, with a good story concept behind it and yet all too familiar, not particularly fun and ultimately forgettable.\n\nThe big issue RiME has lies in the fact that the game never really gets anything to truly hook you with. You run, jump, climb and scream at things to solve problems as you start the game, and that's all you do until the end, with all of these basic mechanics being rather bland. There's never any clever challenge or strategy involved with the platforming bits as they just use the modern approach to 3D platforming where you go along the only (and usually obvious) path, clearly outlined and never need to think where you are in space. Puzzles suffer from a bizarre decision to make action button work only after a short pause after a full stop and scream not working at times if another animation is playing, meaning you always come to a full stop, wait a bit and then hope that you can perform the action necessary, which isn't helping already mundane puzzle design.\n\nAnd the game never properly knows if it wants to be about exploration or not, as it would give you a bunch of things to collect throughout the game world, and give you an open space, but then can just push you into a linear path when you least expect it with no way to backtrack and see if you've missed anything. In addition right from the start it gives you one of the most obnoxious \"guide\" I've encountered in games - a magic fox that barks (more like yaps) to \"help\" you find the way. With the issue being that it always does it either when there's only one way you can take, or when it's somewhere offscreen and you can't possibly know how to get to it, making it useless and annoying in both cases. And not helping if you're trying to explore.\n\nThere's no good story or even mood hook either. There's an attempt at one, but when the revelation of what this game is all about comes, it feels unexpected because the game never actually delivers on that mood at any point prior to that. Like if I'd start showing you my ninth grade pictures while punk rock plays and then at the end tell that this experience was meant to help you understand how to make better pasta. It's not completely unrelated because I like pasta, but... It still doesn't feel like that's what the experience was supposed to be about.\n\nNot that the game doesn't try to be interesting and evocative. It does look good, it does sound good (sans that annoying fox), there are a few puzzles that aren't boring and there are moments that are genuinely interesting. And there is a certain desire to make the game feel as varied as it could. It's just that this isn't enough and it's one of those instances where after finishing the game in 5 hours you feel drained as if you spent the entire day and all your energy on it without really getting anything in return.\n\nRiME seems to have its heart in the right place and it does feel like it tried to be an interesting moving and beautiful journey. But it's not what it turned out to be. It's not a game you should be specifically avoiding and maybe you would have some good times with it, just wondering around and enjoying the look and the mood of the areas. But I can't recommend specifically purchasing the game unless you get it as part of some bundle as your time and money would be better spent elsewhere.\u00a0", "timestamp_created": 1541277498, "timestamp_updated": 1541277498, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794471919536590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45605475": {"recommendationid": "45605475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057104238", "num_games_owned": 729, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1541263038}, "language": "english", "review": "1. \uae38\ucc3e\uae30 \ube61\uc148 2. \uc878\ub9bc 3. \ub2ec\ub9ac\uae30 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ub290\ub824\uc11c \ub2f5\ub2f5 \ud130\uc9d0", "timestamp_created": 1541263505, "timestamp_updated": 1541263505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45599317": {"recommendationid": "45599317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327335751", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1541240934}, "language": "english", "review": "Never before I've written a review, but this gem certainly deserves it - so here it is :)\nI really enjoyed the graphics, it looks beautiful!

It felt like I had already seen these kinds of puzzles, these kinds of adventure in many games before this one. If you already played Tomb Raider, or Zelda, for example, you'll get it. It's not much difficult either, except if you want to get all the achievements. It's also (mostly) linear: even if some places may be huge, there is always only one path. There are not many characters. You'll mostly follow a magic friendly fox, and a mysterious guy with a red cape who remains out of reach. There are some minor defaults, like a camera which sometimes takes dubious initatives, or some zones so dark that I had to switch off the light in my room. It also requires a decent computer.\n\nBut it's a utterly fantastic game, and for me one of the best games of 2017. Why? Because of the ambience.\nIf the vivid screenshots and the trailers didn't give you the compulsive desire to click \"Buy\" right now, wait, there is more:\n[list]\n [*] First, like I said it's not difficult; but it's a good point, because you never feel stuck up very long, it's enjoyable.\n [*] Second, the environment is fantastic. It felt like I was visiting an abandoned crumbling civilisation and I wondered during most of the game what happened and what it was all about.\n [*] Third, the melancholic music, barely audible during the game and yet omnipresent, helps me put in this state of wonder.\n [*] Fourth, the story is great, even if it is sad, and is rarely present in the game.

What I got instead felt like a walking simulator without sufficient payoff, narrative or otherwise.\n\nThe single factor that killed this game for me is the size of the environments, combined with the glacially slow pace. Movement speed in particular would have had to be twice or thrice as high for me not to constantly get bored to tears. It's rage-inducingly slow.\n\nAnd once a game screws up like that way, you know it won't work in other ways, either. For instance, despite the description of \"exploration\", the game is almost entirely linear except for various hidden collectables. But trying to collect those is deeply unsatisfying. Partly due to the glacial movement speed, which discourages walking around. But also because stage select is chapter-based, so trying to collect missing doodads after the fact sounds like soul-crushing pain.\n\nThere's no way to save manually, and the autosave mechanic is pretty bad; I played through the game in a few sessions and typically had to replay a small section each time.\n\nThe game is rather pretty, I do admit. But it's also full of dark areas and zones, and those didn't work for me at all.\n\nWhen it comes to the puzzles themselves, there aren't that many, and most of them are mediocre or trivially easy.\n\nA concrete plot underlies the game, but it's told in a very vague, nonverbal way. The end seems neat-ish, but also disconnected from what came before. I had to read a story explanation to make any sense of it. Not my kind of storytelling.\n\nI hated this game. It felt like it was designed entirely to waste the player's time. Like some business guy realized the game only had 2-3 hours of content, and promptly cut movement speed by 1/2 or 2/3 to pad the playtime numbers. Instead of this mediocre game that does neither puzzles nor exploration well, I recommend purer games instead: e.g. The Witness or Stephen's Sausage Roll for puzzles; and A Hat in Time, a Mario game, or Hollow Knight for platforming and exploration.\n\nPS: My displayed Steam playtime is wrong; the actual playtime was more on the order of 6-7h.", "timestamp_created": 1537445876, "timestamp_updated": 1537445876, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528030574321746826", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44804637": {"recommendationid": "44804637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061080587", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1531364480}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks pretty, but the play is disappointing, and the game itself is rather boring.

No es complicado de superar, por lo que es un t\u00edtulo apto para todo tipo de p\u00fablico, pese que la profundidad de la historia no lo sea. Es una historia arrolladora y aplastante como la vida misma... Lo que empieza como una aventura de un ni\u00f1o que despierta en una isla desierta, sin saber por qu\u00e9 \"que por cierto la isla es preciosa, con ese toque de isla griega\", se convierte en un viaje cada vez mas oscuro, misterioso y l\u00fagubre, para darte cuenta, y no hago spoilers, de que al final, todo era algo muy distinto a lo que el juego te estaba mostrando y darte un buen gancho de izquierdas al coraz\u00f3n... Vamos, que si eres un poco sensiblero como yo, acabas llorando a moco tendido con el final xDDD Y aqu\u00ed reside la importancia de una buena historia se\u00f1ores, el hecho de que al tenerla, al juego se le perdonen otros fallos, como los que anteriormente he mencionado. Ya no me importa la sencillez de la mec\u00e1nica, ni el irrealismo de algunos movimientos o f\u00edsicas... este juego me ha llegado al alma y me ha hecho LLORAR se\u00f1ores... que hoy en d\u00eda es muy dif\u00edcil... Porque aunque no lo parezca, este juego trata de algo muy com\u00fan de la vida cotidiana de las personas...

I would actually describe Rime like that: developers took Journey mechanics, expanded it to big locations and flavored it with mystique and more or less reasonable ending. If you still do not sure whether you should buy it or not, here are the details:\n\nGraphics \u2013 just perfect. Seriously, about 2 hours of my walkthrough I just walked and enjoyed sceneries. The picture is far from photo-realistic but it has its own soft, vivid, saturated style, which creates just wonderful beauties, the sky at night is just something indescribable.\nAfter completion, I collected whole wallpaper pack for my desktop, where half of the pictures were my own screenshots. \n\nAtmosphere is also hard to characterize. I would just say that you dive into the game\u2019s wonders and become astonished by the sceneries. \n\nMusic is great. It perfectly fits the graphics and atmosphere, and the only drawback is inability to by soundtrack directly in Steam. \n\nStory. Well, I don\u2019t wanna spoil it, so I\u2019ll tell you shortly: itself it is not really unique, but with the local storytelling and narrative where you do not really understand what\u2019s happening until the end of the game, it becomes just great and perfectly fits the game. \n\nGameplay. Frankly, not much to say about it. It mostly resembles Journey, the only differences are bigger levels, more freedom and various goals or destinations throughout the game. The rest is quite similar: you walk through beautiful surroundings, solve easy puzzles and encounter only 1-2 aggressive creatures during the whole game. For some it may seem too meditative boring but it\u2019s nice for such a game and complements it. \n\nSo, all in all, RiME is great and in some part even original game, because, despite usual utilized elements, together they form something new and unique.

[/b]\n\nRiME is a puzzle adventure game in the mold of ICO and The Last Guardian, while also evocative of other indies like Journey, Abzu and The Unfinished Swan. If you enjoyed any of those titles, then I\u2019d say it\u2019s safe to say that you will really enjoy RiME.\n\nOriginally debuting with 2012\u2019s Deadlight, developer Tequila Works delivers a real gem with RiME. While I enjoyed Deadlight, a good-not-great post-apocalyptic sidescroller, I would have never guessed they had it in them to make a game like RiME. I compared the game to Sony exclusives ICO and The Last Guardian, which is funny because at one time RiME too was a Sony exclusive. I\u2019d say the split worked out pretty well for Tequila Works and gamers as a whole since more people get to play it now. I also firmly believe that RiME is a better game, and experience, than either ICO or The Last Guardian.\n\nBeing as spoiler free as possible, you play as a young boy who wakes up on a mysterious island. On this island you solve various environmental puzzles that I found to be both fun and intuitive. The game strikes a good balance of being accessible to most people while not making its solutions obvious on first glance. The game also boasts a striking visual aesthetic than is strong throughout and wholly cohesive.\n\nGameplay wise, it\u2019s most similar to The Last Guardian, albeit with much, much better controls. I actually couldn\u2019t finish TLG because I found the controls to so offensively bad. RiME is much better with it and I rarely found myself missing a jump and falling off something. Luckily, if you do make a wrong jump the checkpoint system is quite generous, so you\u2019ll never lose too much progress. Perhaps the thing that most impressed me gameplay wise was the camera system. So often in third person games the camera can get hung up on the environment or just plain get in your way. This is not the case with RiME at all. It\u2019s very cinematic and truthfully I rarely had to touch the camera controls. It always seems to be in the right place at the right time and more importantly does not impede you at all.\n\nI\u2019m keeping this review somewhat intentionally vague because I think it\u2019s best to go in blind. If you liked the games I mentioned at the top, then know that this is a game for you. It often bests what those games do and will definitely deliver on the emotional beats as well. Tequila Works really outdid themselves with this one and delivered one of the best indie experiences of the past couple of years in my eyes. This should be a game in everyone\u2019s collection.", "timestamp_created": 1530487918, "timestamp_updated": 1607228724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561157405376434326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43227268": {"recommendationid": "43227268", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997194818", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 851, "last_played": 1530472817}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]TIP: M&K Users! Take your fingers completely off the keyboard between movement changes during climbing puzzles. I'm guessing it doesn't handle key-holding well because the game was designed for controllers. Except for that and a few issues with climb-onto-box-directly-in-front-of-you, keyboard + mouse works just fine.\n\nTIP2: Achievement Hunters! Don't even bother looking for the various collectibles if you want to avoid a walkthrough on your first playthrough. You absolutely will not find them, and some are pretty convoluted and will require multiple playthroughs. Do yourself a favor and play the game once for the story, and then again for the achievements. I HATE using guides/walkthroughs, but it's a must for this game.

Under any other circumstances this would be a negative review due to poor performance, lack of manual saving, poor controls, tedious achievements, and an embarrassingly bad-looking protagonist. Aesthetics aside, the reason for making a game in this style is an easy performance win, but too much unoptimized-for-PC polish added to that makes the game run sluggishly. I'm sure it runs great on consoles, but the cool water effects just aren't worth the frame loss on PC when you have a main character whose face looks like Mr. Potatohead. To estimate 6 hours of playtime (single playthrough) seems reasonable, but $30 for a game with no replayability outside of achievements seems steep to me.

I started out going \"Okay, this game is so saturated with Ico and Shadow of the Colossus that it's an irrefutable fact that it will be sad or uplifting (or sadlifting).  I'm prepared so I'll be fine.\"\n\nAnd somewhere along the line this went to \"Ok that's pretty sad\" to \"Ok that's utterly heartbreaking actually\" to \"WAIT NO NOT THIS, STOP, RIME PLEASE NO I HAVE A FAMILY.\"  So, fair warning, if you possess empathy, Rime will get tears out of you.\n\nA lot of people complain that the story was vague, but it in fact seems extremely straightforward to me.  If you're confused about something then you're probably taking it too literally.  Also, just look at the names of the levels (either at the end or on a walkthrough like I did) and the nature of the game itself should be made extremely clear to you literally at first glance.  (So on that note, fair warning that looking at a walkthrough is a kind of spoiler, but this one probably enhanced more than hurt my playthrough tbh.)\n\nOn that note, yeah, I had to use a walkthrough once or twice.  There are some little finicky points in the game where things just aren't that clear (e.g.; I got stuck in an area where an enemy kept blasting me off a ledge, which no one else seemed to experience, until I figured out that I had to pass by from MUCH closer to the enemy than the game had taught me was wise, but to be fair it had also taught that moving around just under this enemy was okay, so--YMMV).  I also struggled when the game got dark, because Enu (the kid) will usually stop and hang from a ledge but sometimes he apparently just says \"screw it\" and jumps.  This was only a mechanic in one or two areas though.\n\nOtherwise, the graphics are beautiful, and I didn't struggle too much with the controls.  The keyboard support is definitely nice for people like me who're short on controllers, but there are a lot of areas where it's super clear it would be more fun with an analog stick, and camera control through the mouse is very much an acquired taste on this kind of game, so I'd definitely recommend a controller where possible.\n\nAlso, yeah it runs short (and if you're an Ueda fan then you're probably used to that sad inevitability), but there's a lot of replay value.  Collectibles carry over at the end of the game, so you can play at your own pace and not worry so much about missing out.  And the multiple levels are sprawling, with a lot of different tones, so in most of them it's very easy to get distracted from your goal by exploration.  I'm definitely looking forward to poking around again without having to worry about advancing.\n\nSo yeah I recommend it.  I don't know how to end this.

The game doesn't tell you anything: you interpret the story in your own way, you aren't told where to go or how to get there. Some people might get frustrated by that. Me? I was so moved by the game that I couldn't care less. The game is visually breathtaking, emotional, fun, exciting, heartbreaking, and all-around excellent (It reminded me a lot of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. The sound design is also incredible, and I can say without hesitation that the music really added to the experience as a whole.\n\nLike I said, the game isn't for everyone: the story can be frustrating to understand, the puzzles can be frustrating to solve, and some may find it too slow.

I bought this game a while ago placed it on the backlog. Had I played this the year it came out I'd be screaming GOTY CONTENDER.\n\nAnyway if you liked games like 'The Witness' or 'The Talos Principle', this game is right up your alley although I didn't find the puzzles to be as mind-numbingly difficult.\n\nThe pace of the game for me personally was perfect. I walk up to a puzzle, don't understand it one bit. After some pondering and playtesting with the physics/mechanics the eureka moment hits and it all makes sense. I never felt like pulling my hair out.\n\nIf you like an immersive, well paced story, progressively harder puzzles with different mechanics for most, and an eye for the art style (It only gets more beautiful) GET THIS GAME :D", "timestamp_created": 1521533908, "timestamp_updated": 1521533908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40923985": {"recommendationid": "40923985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099882601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1521478383}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a hidden gem in the gaming world. Gorgous graphics, amazing storyline, and great gameplay. The game is one of very few on steam that I absolutly love that has no violence in it whatsoever. While some darker areas on the map may scare small children, and certain mobs as well, overall it is a very great game I could recommend to anyone looking for something to sink their money into. However, without spoiling the game I will say this, the objects and objectives in the game are highly symbolic. I recommend AFTER completing the game to go look for a simpler explanation online as the game, espeacially the ending, is not very obvious in its meanings. This is also a very puzzle and story centric game, keep that in mind before purchasing if your looking for something faster paced, as this game is generally very slow, and mostly aims to invoke different emotions in the player.\n\nAs for the cons, there aren't very many. They are on the development side, but here they are in order from greatest complaints to least:\n\nFor one, Anti-Aliasing in this game is broken. I am running a Vega 56 card overclocked and I COULD NOT run SSAA even in 1080p medium settings. I was getting 20fps tops with horrible input lag. TXAA also has issues barley letting me hold on to 40-50 fps with some massive frame rate spikes dipping into the 20s. Honestly however, FXAA looks fine and seems to work great in this game. I was able to hold 60fps (as the max allowed in this game is 60fps for some reason) at 2k resolution max settings with FXAA on. I really wish the developers would fix this, but since this game is ported from console I can see why they would have issues like this.\n\nSecond, the parkour mechanics (at least on PC) can be frustrating at times. The main character you play has issues grabbing onto ledges you are supposed to climb or jump onto if you are already on another platform. Even if the distance is small and it is obvious that is where you need to go next. To make your life easier here is a TIP: While climbing be sure that your character is reaching out for the next platform BEFORE your make any jumps, this will tell you if he will make the jump or not without uneccesarily falling to his death.\n\nThird, even without VSYNC, Freesync, Gsync, or whatever else you have, 60FPS is the max allowed in this game, I don't see why but that is just the way it is. Mabey it's for the physics engine or something but I doubt it. You really don't need more then 60fps in this game but I thought I would mention it.\n\nFourth: By far the most minor complaint, but it shows a small lack of polish with the port of this game to PC. MINOR SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!!!!....... With that being said in certain spots in the game where you have to run from a mob (like in the above game pictures and preview section where you are running away from the bird) you character does not run straight across the bridge because of the camera angle. Because of this it is way to easy to fall off the bridge while running for your life. Its easy to fix this by just tapping the direction you need to go to compensate for the slight drag you have while trying to go straight but it needed to be mentioned so a dev can fix this small issue in an otherwise amazing game.\n\nOverall: This game recieves 8/10 for what it is, and only loses the 2 points due to some issues with the port to PC. Keep in mind, I am a harsh critique. With that said, if you are on the fence, BUY THIS GAME!", "timestamp_created": 1521481506, "timestamp_updated": 1521481506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526749014854431152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40907684": {"recommendationid": "40907684", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970286551", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1802, "last_played": 1517170685}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Sometimes you just can't keep playing anymore and you wish you could just save and leave it there.\n- \u200emy biggest complain: the story, the \"adventure\". First, it's way too vague for me. I hate stories were you have very little concrete information and are left wondering and theorising, absolutely hate them. I didn't expect this game to be like this and it totally is. Also, the story itself... Spoilers ahead: I was totally disappointed to see that this island was somehow not actually real and the quest, the adventure I thought I was living, was totally not like what I had imagined. I thought this would be a great adventure were we would end up saving the island somehow, that we would have a victorius and happy ending. But it turned out to be a vaguely defined tragedy. I don't play video games to get depressed or confused while theorising. I play to go on a wonderful and exciting adventure that leaves me feeling satisfied and happy in the end. Think Zelda.

Top notch aesthetics! There are few locations visually quite distinct from one another. And while I did prefer chapters 1 & 3 for their brighter palette, all of them painted a really nice atmosphere. \n\nThe game features some puzzles too, but if you're following the main route, they are all quite easy and fairly obvious to figure out what needs to be done. The difficulty raises only if you decide to go for all the collectibles - many of them are tricky to obtain & hard to spot. Although there are way too many sets of objects to collect that don't serve any other purpose than collecting for the sake of collecting. Only few types were useful, like outfits, lullaby song parts (such a beautiful tune btw), or metaphorical story panels. But I can stand behind making the difficulty dynamic depending on how the player chooses to play :)\n\nThe story was vague and enigmatic most of the time, but when the reveal came at the end it turned out to be very emotional.

It's another \"mysterious boy wakes up and must run through the world solving puzzles in order to contine proceeding through the world\" games.  Its okay...it's fun in some parts, over-long in others.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.  By the end, I was wondering when it was going to end since it started to drag on and on. \n\nSo here's the biggest issue...It wants to be Ico, but the problem is, the character you play is so generic.  In Ico, the boy stumbles around in a way that gives him character.  He has a girl to interact with and you get to care about him because he has personality in his body language and the way he interacts with her.  In Rime, you're just some kid who shouts at things a lot.  There's no emotion, and even when there is a part where he is crying, it still doesn't come off very realistic...now we just have a generic character who is crying.  Even worse is the lovely score hits you over the head literally trying to violently pull some feelings out of you, but it feels so cloying, it just comes off as \"meh.\"\n\nThe end, well, I get it...and it was probably the only part that gave me a few goosebumps, but it's a little too Deus Ex Machina for me.  It's lazy.  I'd rather have a game like The Witness not even pretend to have a story but be somewhat entertaining, then the ending here that felt a little too tacked on.  Like they got to the end and went, \"Oh, we really do need to find some time to make up a reason why the player is doing all these things...\"\n\nAnyways, I recommend it because it is pretty, has a nice soundtrack and it's a pleasant way to spend a couple of evenings.

Let's roll:\n\n[b]TLDR version[/b]\n\nbuy this game if:\n\n+ you love games that visually and emotionally are able to stimulate \n+ you like story driven games with a [u]side puzzle component[/u]\n+ you fancy games that show different scenarios and setups quite often\n\ndon't buy this game if:\n\n- you don't have a \"decent\" / above \"mid-tier\" pc\n- you believe that spending 40$ on a 5 hour game might be too much\n- you love games heavily based on puzzles\n\nVerdict 8/10, well done, deep (expensive too) and meaningful gaming experience \nTime required to complete the main game : 5 hours\nTime required to 100% the game: 8-10 hours \n\n[b]Detailed version[/b]\n\nA quick summary of the most important subjects:\n\n1- [b]The price tag[/b] can be discouraging and intimidating. The game hasn't any replayability value: replaying the story chapters will only grant you the chance to grab those collectibles you'll be needing for the real ending. Now... im not a business or budgeting manager, so i don't know why this price tag has been decided. I'm not saying that this title doesn't deserve its money, just keep in mind that for 40$ you can get many good indie titles at the same time rather then getting only this gorgeous, deep and terrific looking one that will last only for 5 hours.\n\n2- [b] The pacing and story telling is extremely well structured [/b] as the game will start off with a sunny seaside landscapes, ruled by a peaceful environment and will keep changing throughout the whole game by switching themes, songs, enemies and situations, while being able to be and to seem fresh and never repetitive through the whole experience, which will be heavily puzzle based at the start and will get more and more platforming centered after.\n\n3- [b] Frame drops aside, the game is really polished and meaningful [/b] as shown here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275327542\n\njust to give you an example, when the young protagonist has to climb a slope, has to lean, sit down or just performing physical activity...he's actually realistic as his moves are properly represented. \nYou will his see his legs moving accordingly and his whole body reacting naturally. Many puzzles and rooms are based on \"dignity and magnificence\" so you'll always have a chance to admire the landscapes, secrets and clearing out the game areas without any abrupt shifts or pauses (unlike Hob, just to give you an example).\n\nTO SUM UP:\n\nPlay this game if you want to be enchanted by a gorgeous, expensive and short puzzle - story driven game. If you're looking for a long puzzle game only, you might have to look for something else.\n\nThanks for reading and for bearing up with me, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night, feel free to follow my other reviews at: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32344423/", "timestamp_created": 1516443328, "timestamp_updated": 1557695733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78836137056350708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39445384": {"recommendationid": "39445384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060796068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1562174267}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Artisticamente es precioso.

It looked gorgeous and relaxing - just the type of game I love to play. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.\n\nPros:\n-Absolutely stunning.\n-The soundtrack is fantastic.\n-Puzzles aren't too difficult (definitely don't overthink them or you will get stuck).\n-Super interesting visuals and ideas.\n\nMeh\n-The story is simple but you don't really understand much until the very end. Once the ending was revealed, a lot of the gameplay mechanics and symbolism really made sense, but I would have liked to have understood a bit more as I went through the game. Going OH repeatedly at the end of the game took away from the story. This is the type of game you need to replay to get the full value of the story/symbolism.\n-Controller controls are a bit meh.\n-Maneuvering the boy can get a little annoying - you have to hit some things just right or you have to start all over.\n-The game is essentially a jumping/parkour simulator. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is not what I wanted out of a game, so I got super bored quickly. Especially when I kept missing jumps and had to start all over.\n\nCons\n-The camera is horrible. It locks in certain areas, making it impossible to look around and see where you need to go. Other times it positions itself weirdly and the angles make it seem like you're closer to something than you really are, resulting in missed jumps.\n-Sometimes it is really hard to figure out where you need to go/what you need to do. The level layout is a bit wonky. It allows for a lot of exploration if you're into that kind of thing, but it can become a maze-like convoluted mess to those who just want to run through the game.\n\nI really, really, really wanted to adore this game. And in some respects I do. It is stunningly beautiful. The soundtrack really adds to the atmosphere. The story is emotional and interesting. Yet, at the same time, the game is boring. The first chapter consists of running around 'collecting' a few things. The second chapter consists of running from spot to spot while being chased. The third chapter is by far the absolute best - the puzzles are great, the gameplay mechanics are wonderful, and the story bits are fantastic. Then the fourth chapter is basically a repeat of the first chapter but with rain. I think, overall, I was just disappointed that the game wasn't what I expected. I wanted a super compelling story game with puzzle mechanics. Instead I got a jumping simulator with a story that doesn't really make sense until the very end. Nothing that continuously compelled me to continue playing.\n\nA playthrough of just the story will take you about 5 hours. Collecting all the things and achievements might take you around 10 hours. You will likely be super bored. I still recommend the game but definitely get it on sale. $30 is too much.", "timestamp_created": 1516106686, "timestamp_updated": 1516106686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57723921537399292", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39370012": {"recommendationid": "39370012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034274574", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 201, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1514692879}, "language": "english", "review": "RiME had a very troubled development. The Spanish team Tequila Works, known for Deadlight (2012), began working on it in 2010 with the temporary title of Echoes of Siren; it should have been an action RPG with isometric view, crafting and survival mechanics, building of fortifications, strategic battles, exploration. Microsoft initially supported the project but later rejected it; the ball passed into the hands of Sony, which made it an exclusive for Playstation, until in 2016 Tequila Works repurchased the rights to distribute it on all platforms. Meanwhile, the concept of the game was completely transformed; the title became RiME, which I think it\u2019s for Rest in MEmory and alludes to the meaning of the whole adventure that I leave you to unveil: this review is spoiler free.\n\nIt is a third-person 3D adventure characterized by a pleasant cartoon-style cell shading graphics; it is set on a mysterious and fascinating island that offers a great variety of breathtaking scenery. You impersonate a child with a red cape that is shipwrecked on the island and wakes up on the seashore; the starting scene is reminiscent of the final scene of ICO, one of RiME\u2019s inspirational sources; other sources of inspiration are certainly The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002), Journey (2012) and The Last Guardian (2016). From the beginning you are captured by the magical atmosphere of the island, and stimulated to thoroughly explore it for understanding its many mysteries. Sceneries offer majestic architectures that remind of the ones of ICO and The Last Guardian and therefore refer to the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio De Chirico and in part also to some visions of Salvator Dali. A certain spiritual, mystical, and ancestral aura is strengthened by the rapid cycling of day and night, with effects of light and color enchanting eyes and spirit. If you have a romantic and sensitive soul, I advise you to play immersed in the quiet of the night to get the maximum enjoyment.\n\nMain components of gameplay are initially exploration and contemplation; later on, environmental puzzles prevail. Puzzles make use of the alienating architectural perspectives and of light and shadow effects; they are well-designed and help to keep high the enigmatic and mystical atmosphere of the experience. Their locations are full of symbols that recall the unconscious, the past and the memory; they are not too difficult, do not require particular skills. Some of them are cooperative and have to be solved with the help of your companions; yes, you are not alone on the island: a little fox will be your guide spirit, and a strange automata, a sort of Wheatley from Portal 2 but bigger and on iron stilts, will lead you towards the end of your journey.\n\nGameplay will be sometime interrupted by enigmatic cut scenes concerning child\u2019s past; they help to keep attention high and feed the desire to go on and understand the meaning of the experience. Aura of mystery is strengthened by frequent and suggestive encounters with a black and faceless man wrapped in a red cloth. Pace is well calibrated thanks to some moments of action where you have to face a few threats; in particular a big prehistoric bird that will give you a long hard time, and some strange hooded beings, a sort of dark priests who fear the light. Challenge is really minimal, and it is right for a game that focuses on contemplation; in any case you do not run the risk of dying: if you happen to fall from a ravine or get caught by the prehistoric bird or the dark priests, by magic you would start the game from the previous checkpoint, just a bit confused and bruised, just like in The Last Guardian.\n\nAnd now we come to the less successful aspect of the game: narration.....\n\n( for a deeper analisys and rating, continue on VGArt Website: https://vgartsite.wordpress.com/2018/01/15/rime/ )\n\nSteam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/VgArtInt\n\nCurator Page: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26168615-Video-Games-Art-International/", "timestamp_created": 1516037304, "timestamp_updated": 1516129335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617945671081542969", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39353155": {"recommendationid": "39353155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176413526", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 673, "last_played": 1515977320}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un buen juego con un final emotivo", "timestamp_created": 1515977185, "timestamp_updated": 1515977185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39349903": {"recommendationid": "39349903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173746983", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1515963915}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lo primero que pense cuando lo recibi era que tenia que ser malisimo pero me he llevado una gran sorpresa con este titulo, acostumbrado a ser el portador de la muerte en la mayoria de juegos aqui la mayor agresion que puedes hacerle a una criatura es \"gritarle\" literalmente, aun asi RiME es toda una experiencia su mundo es magico su dise\u00f1o artistico maravilloso y su banda sonora es preciosa, no entiendo de arte pero diria que es como si de una obra de arte hecha videojuego se tratase.\nSu jugabilidad me gusta bastante, ese plataformeo al estilo Prince of Persia y los puzles que quizas no son muy dificil pero no todos se hacen a la primera, en alguna ocasion note caidas de FPS pero en general diria que el juego en si esta bien pulido", "timestamp_created": 1515965712, "timestamp_updated": 1515965712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39234494": {"recommendationid": "39234494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048101201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 194, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1515599130}, "language": "english", "review": "RiME is a lovely game with little danger, simple puzzles, and beautiful places to explore.

Some of the puzzles are really cool conceptually - I love some of the light amd shadow puzzles in particular - but they're almost never confusing or frustrating. Overall, this was a really artistically resonant experience. The ending isn't exactly surprising, but it was nicely done.\n\nThat said, there are a few moments where I thought the game lacked polish. Some of the climbing segments twist the camera at odd angles where the controls stop being predictable, and it becomes difficult to orient the character for a jump to another ledge. Some of the scenes are very visually dark, which can be difficult to look at, let alone complete things in (thankfully, the puzzles are all pretty simple). The art style is also so beautiful, especially as evidenced in the first and third levels, that it's a shame how often the game goes dark and dim.\n\nStill - lovely game overall, simple and curious, well-orchestrated and great to look at.

Its hard to describe without spoiling but I will say this, you wont expect the ending. I enjoy obscure story telling and RiME did a good job at it. \n\nVisually, RiME looks incredible. You will progress through lots of varied zones, from sunny beatiful islands, to dark caverns. Whats great about the levels is that every single one is tied to the story and once you finish it, you'll understand in what way. Theres also a time of day in the first map which was fantastic. \n\nGameplay basically consists of platforming and puzzle solving. All are incredibly easy and straightforward. I would've enjoyed a bit of a challenge though. Still, it never gets dull and it always feels cool. \n\nSoundtrack, as with everything else in the game is tied to the story as well.

But then, after a memorable area of hide-and-seek (like Limbo's spider), the plot gets lost. Mechanics that are introduced get a little bit of iteration and then are never used again.\n\nYou're supposed to be climbing a tower, but then randomly you'll just be in some other area entirely. One part has a groundhog day-esque section, then in another you're really just following some magic robots. The forest area was a confused mess, with no clear goal. Neither does the rainy area have a sense of place - it's just an arena to run around and solve four simplistic platforming puzzles. Where is it? Is it on top of the tower? It looks too big to be there. If these were meant to be inside the tower, it sure didn't feel like it. If these were meant to be around the tower, the tower should have been there in the background as a reminder of where we were and what our main goal is.\n\nThe game tries to give a sense of emotional weight to its narrative, but it doesn't spend enough time developing it. The fox for example, you bring it into being at the start and then it just acts as a guide of where to go. You don't really interact with it further, and then it rushes through its beats at the end. The nameless spirits are sometimes scared, then they're dangerous, then they're indifferent. Sometimes the soundtrack perfectly picks up the pace and setting, other times it's curiously absent.\n\nWith a better sense of progression of the tower, more interaction with the few characters so that their stories carried more weight, it could be greatly improved. It's an enjoyable experience, maybe a 6.5/10.

There, I liked a game on my own merit, it's not impossible. It's also not impossible for me to like a game despite being biased against it.\n\nI bought the game after having only seen a few bright, colorful, and cheerful advertisements about this kid solving puzzles and chasing after a spirit fox. I did not sign up for a depressing story about a family death, finding graves and ghosts, and overall the plot/story being representative of the cycle of grief. Especially when one of the achievements hints that the fox might \"die\" too.\n\nI find myself a simple person. I like amazing graphics, exploration, feeling successful, and solving puzzles or otherwise feeling witty and special. I, having had family deaths in my history, do not like stories where a person or animal you become attached to passes away. I do not like admitting that the cycle of grief exists or that I have problems accepting the past. I especially didn't like the symmetry between my mom passing away and the scene witnessed through the keyhole.\n\nStill, I like this game. It throws trials at you that may require some poking at times, but are simple enough to enjoy the scenery. I love the way you move through the water, considering few games realize how difficult it can be to be partially in the water.There's also the way the grief cycle is represented; it hit the feels. The biggest puzzle is the metaphors presented, not the puzzles themselves. There's the story you read on Wikipedia and then the alternate stories within RiMe. I'd love to talk about it more, but I'm also trying to be vague and let you figure it out yourself.\n\nI recommend looking into it; the puzzles aren't as tough to solve as those presented in The Legend of Zelda, but it's got a way more complex story than rescuing a princess from a tyrant.

I did not expect it to wrap up in the way it did. At first, it seemed to be all over the place but by the end of the game. You begin to fill the pieces, and the story becomes clear to you. I really enjoyed the story of this game. One of the better ones in recent memory.\n\nGameplay: Controlling the protagonist is fun. This game is a puzzle platformer, and it does its job decently. You won't be disappointed. I encountered less than a handful of bugs throughout my experience. Most of them did not repeat after the first time, and they did not hinder my experience throughout the game since they only occurred in circumstances.\n\nGraphics: I really really loved the art style of this game. At first, I thought the developers would use the same style throughout the game, but they changed it up multiple times. The game has varied environments, and each one looks just as good as the other. There are plenty of moments where you will look at it, and say wow! That looks awesome! To put it simply, it's gorgeous in many cases.\n\nSound: I loved the soundtrack of this game even more than its graphics. I'd go as far to say that without the soundtrack, this game would not have impressed me as much as it did. I wish they released a digital download of it (I would buy it asap). It picks up when it needs to, and it slows down when it needs to. It's done so well. It won't disappoint you at all.\n\nI recommend this game for those that are looking for a great puzzle platformer. If you're the type of person that does not enjoy solving puzzles. There is a good chance that you will not enjoy this game because it might get frustrating for you. The puzzles are not difficult, and they are laid out in a pretty logical way in most cases. There are not many games in which I wait for the credits to finish, but this is one of the games in which I did exactly that. It left a strong impression on me, and I wish there were more games like this one. If you are a numbers person, I would give this a 10/10 (It's not the perfect game, but it gets damn close to it for me).", "timestamp_created": 1512058568, "timestamp_updated": 1512058666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37925557": {"recommendationid": "37925557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372432559", "num_games_owned": 2044, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1544544374}, "language": "english", "review": "I was shocked to a large extent by its good soundtrack + beautiful scenary + incredible innovation when I was once streaming the video on Youtube concerning RiME.\n --> --> 10/10 <-- <-- NO DOUBT!", "timestamp_created": 1511954919, "timestamp_updated": 1511954963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552727818489074707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37911103": {"recommendationid": "37911103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057387962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1553427036}, "language": "english", "review": "RiME is a game where you play as a little boy wandering around in this beautiful world. The story consists of 5 chapters, 5th being very short, making the playtime around 5-6 hours, unless you look for unlockables and want to be a completionist.\n\nPositives:\n-Let's start with the important one, story. The story is.... AMAZING. One of the best stories I've played through, even though it was short, I really enjoyed it. At first the story seems a bit weird but slowly it all starts to make sense. The story even got very touching towards the end.\n-The camera angles are most of the time in the scenes well done, but this also makes the movement sometimes different, since you move your character with for example W, you move your character forward, no matter where you look. This only happens in \"locked\" camera angles and otherwise the camera moves with your characters movement.\n-The details on the textures and animations are amazing. There are so many cool little details that make the game just a slighty better. One of my favorites is that if you run for a while and run into a wall, your character will fall and get up.\n-The sounds and soundtracks fit perfectly into the game and in every scene are just perfect. It really made every part of the game better just by being really fitting to the part of the story.\n\nNegatives:\n-It isn't that well optimized. Even with a GTX 1080 with max graphics, I was able to get 50-80 fps in most parts, and on some very detailed areas and such, it dropped down to 40ish. The game was still enjoyable, and I could've set down anti aliasing and such small, but very performance eating settings.\n-It's too short. The story is full and amazing, but I want more just because of the soundtracks and graphics.\n-The price. I got it for free from a giveaway (thankfully, because I wouldn't pay 35\u20ac for this even after I've played it). But if it goes on sale and you want an amazing game, buy it. it might be worth it depending how much you are ready to spend on a game with only max 10 hours of gameplay, unless you play it all over again.", "timestamp_created": 1511900857, "timestamp_updated": 1542825597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615439057350158691", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37905879": {"recommendationid": "37905879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285698978", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 595, "last_played": 1504082625}, "language": "english", "review": "Rime is a beautiful little game where you can immerse yourself in a gorgeous captivating world \nand it generally left me in awe with its simplicity of graphics, it's haunting soundtrack and it's interesting characters you meet along the way. Rime takes you on a emotional roller coaster ride with scenes in the game that range from confusion, wonder, joy, anger, sorrow and grief.  \n That being said; this is a game which left me feeling like I wanted more and that it was somehow still missing something. As other reviews have stated they are correct that this game is short and could use more material within it, however I saw no problem with the controls of the game or the operation of it, making Rime an easy win in my book for performance. if you have ever played a little well known game called Ico, you will surly like this game. Replay value is not too high here, completing a collections and adding more achievements does not really add much, the outfits are cool, but Rime's ending really cuts it for me. So should you invest your time in this game? sure!  the first play through would be no problem and generally worth it, but besides selecting stages for a second play through I don't see myself going back and playing the whole game again and that's sad. Rime has a great recipe of all the good ingredients that generally makes a really good game, what it lacks is enough support and enough material to expanded.

You're too much directed to where you can or cannot go, and I feel it hurts an exploration-based game. Basically, there is the main path, and secondary paths where you get collectibles. However, straying from the main path will often be rewarded, especially if you go for the 100%.\nOne other bad design choice is that camera orientation defines the direction where you'll be moving forward. So if you want to look around to enjoy the stunning environment, you'll have a hard time keeping moving straight at the same time. This flaw is especially bad in the few bridge cutscenes when you don't control the camera angle and have to walk straight on a bridge despite the camera being oriented sideways. The visual effect is good, but the gameplay requires you to sidestep in order to advance forward on the bridge (or fall and die)\n\nAll in all, it feels like playing a beautiful movie : follow the script, and enjoy the show.

I've had it on my wishlist for awhile, and was pleasantly surprised to get the free game key.\n\nI want to like this game, but ultimately it's not really the game advertised on this page. Contrary to what the description would have you believe, this is not an exploration game, but rather a highly linear adventure with a few small side areas with collectibles. Which is really a shame, since the strongest part of the game is the world. I've always enjoyed the ancient sci-fi theme, and I wish I could actually really explore a world based around it instead of being railroaded through it.\n\nThe graphic aesthetics are great. The world, especially the first few areas, are beautiful and beg to be explored. Music is just okay, it's very much mood music and gets repetitive pretty quickly. \n\nThe puzzles are fairly simplistic, and the only reason they can be difficult at times is because the game can be very vague and even directionless at times and you won't see the ledge you're supposed to climb (or realize that you can interact with the critical object you need to move forwards) until you've run around for quite awhile. The game literally throws you into the world with no inkling of what you're supposed to do or what the controls are or how they work. I get that many AAA games handhold the player too much and the devs want to encourage exploration (as limited as it is), but mant times it felt like this was taken a little too far.\n\nOn top of that, the controls are quite clunky and unresponsive at times, and only being able to save at checkpoints is something that should stay in the past and not be dragged into the present. At times, the camera can be a nuisance as well with the forced perspective changes.\n\nI've also run into a few bugs with puzzles that let you get into previous areas, but then can't get back to where you're supposed to be so you have to reload the checkpoint. Checkpoints are a little too far apart for being the only place to save, resulting in having to replay good sized chunks of the game if you have to quit in the middle or run into a bug.\n\nI also had some issues with optimization, this game is very heavy on the CPU for no good reason that I can see given the simplistic gameplay. Might be a result of this being a console port with the PC version taking a back seat.\n\nThen there's the story. I'll try not to spoil it, but the ending is depressing, and I think this would have been a better game is the devs had kept it as ancient sci-fi with a fantasy story instead of having the depressing link to reality it is now.\n\nThere's also the issue of length. I have no problem with short games, but I do have a problem when they're priced like much larger ones and don't have much in the way of replay value. As you can see from my playtime, it takes about 3 hours to finish the game. I didn't hunt for collectibles, if you wanted to go back and get those it would add a few more hours, but you're still not really getting a great value at the asking price. Especially since I didn't really find the story rewarding.\n\nOverall, not bad at all for a free game, or even for a modest price, but I'm glad I didn't impulse buy it earlier when it was on sale. I'm giving it a thumbs down because overall, the only really good thing the game has is the aesthetics and the world, yet you're not really given a chance to explore it.", "timestamp_created": 1511342185, "timestamp_updated": 1511342322, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36668929": {"recommendationid": "36668929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045061508", "num_games_owned": 836, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 131, "last_played": 1624683588}, "language": "english", "review": "It can be fun playing this game, walking around, solving puzzles.

There is not a word of dialogue (that is comprehensible), yet it knows to tell a story and guide you along through a beautifully designed world. What struck me the most is that you could feel the passion of the developers, there is a lot of raw emotion injected into the game which reveals itself slowly but surely and leads to a satisfying conclusion. The game itself is not difficult, it has fairly straightforward puzzles but the pacing is great. It's relatively slow, but it suits the vibe of the game and it builds the intrigue more and more as you go on. \n\nThe game starts out in a world that's seemingly open and ready for exploration, which it is to an extent, but it's mostly secrets and collectibles that hide in the corners of the world. The game itself is linear and that's okay. The world is interesting enough that the exploration feels satisfying just to make your way through the beautifully crafted design. I definitely felt drawn to investigate the nooks and crannies and interact with all the objects that allowed it.\n\nThe main character is part of what makes the game awesome. The entire game revolves around this boy that finds itself in this mysterious place, guided by a little fox while the full story gets revealed through flashbacks and symbolism throughout the course of the game. His design is absolutely adorable, with a bright red cape and an innocent appearance. There is a dedicated 'yell' button (which activates certain objects in the game) which is the best. I love yelling at stuff. I love how flames flair up as he screams and I basically couldn't stop screaming (or humming depending on the situation). His animations are also just lovely. He feels genuine and lovable in a world that caters to his mystery.\n\nAll in all a very recommended game. It takes obvious inspiration from Team Ico games, especially Ico.

In the end, being a sucker for art styles of this kind, I bought Rime expecting a gorgeous puzzle game with a relatively balanced difficulty and clear nods to ICO, an old PS2 favorite from my college days. What I got was an unexpectedly emotional journey, told mostly through level design alone, about loss. Having recently had a family member pass away, I can only say that this game cut deep, and while the conclusion hurt like hell, it feels oddly providential to have played it this close to my family member's stepping beyond the Veil. Granted, I also did not see this story coming and only in hindsight does the way this game is built, make sense. \n\nGood old hindsight. Life is always a little clearer looking back. Rime is no different. I've played a few games similar to this one. Again it reminded me of ICO and Shadow of the Collosus and Journey and a few other expected note strikers lots of critics have hit in their reviews. With this game though, the epic setting and mythical atmosphere, really touch on a sense of loss and the process of grief that frankly, hit much closer to home for me than any of the previous titles, because it isn't a prince trying to save a princess by killing Gods, or a boy leading a blind girl out of a fortress. This is about a broken family, and the peices that must be picked up after that breaking occurs. You may be guiding this boy through a quest, but you're also piecing something together, that was broken, all so that you can let it go. \n\nBeing a puzzle platformer that is more about the amtosphere of the journey than the puzzles themselves, this kind of game is not for everyone and for others, it may be best to wait till it's on sale. For me, this was a kind of catharsis, that I guess fate decided I needed to experience at this point in my life and given the love the devs put into it, as well as the thank you's they write in the end credits, well, that kind of heart ended up being worth $30.", "timestamp_created": 1510547426, "timestamp_updated": 1510547636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36453940": {"recommendationid": "36453940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387996628", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1519268342}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buenisimo", "timestamp_created": 1510435960, "timestamp_updated": 1510435960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36423619": {"recommendationid": "36423619", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981682505", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1510324710}, "language": "english", "review": "Had potential to be awesome but in my view came up short.

However when I won a giveaway for this game I decided to give it a try, and boy was I happy I did. I personally love these types of games, and RiME definitely filled a hole in me that I didn't even know I had. RiME is not for everyone, but for the niche audience it is for, you are in for one ride, and it is one hell of a ride.\n[i]Note: the game does suffer from some minor optimization issues, but is more than playable[/i] \n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1] \nRiME's artstyle and visuals are the best I have every seen. Every frame is awe-inspiring, with crisp textures and an amazing artstyle that is reminiscent of Abzu or The Witness. I found myself stopping and admiring the environment every minute or so, it's that good. Animations look amazing and feel extremely smooth. RiME also focuses on letting the player take a high ground and observe the entire area that they just explored and that only adds to how beautiful this game already is. \nSCORE 10/10 \n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1] \nRiME is a game mostly about exploration and puzzle solving. Puzzles are fairly easy and don't require too much thought to be put into them, but they are enjoyable and have some great concepts behind them. Puzzles feel like they are built into the environment, which makes them feel natural. Exploration is enjoyable, mostly due to the fact on how amazing the graphics are. However, most of the game is a walking simulator which might be a problem for some people, but not for others. RiME is also a fairly short game, only being 5-6 hours long, which wasn't that big of a problem for me since it's obvious to see how much the developers tried to put in into those 5-6 hours.  \nSCORE 8/10 \n[h1]AUDIO[/h1] \nThe musical score in RiME is fantastic. The music is incredibly relaxing and matches the tone of the game perfectly. I'm not a big fan of classical music, but RiME's soundtrack obviously has so many emotions thrown into it that it's hard not to appreciate it. I'm not really a music guy so there's not much else I can say other than the music really is amazing. \nSCORE 9/10 \n[h1]STORY[/h1] \nAfter playing through the game and reflecting on the story I am truly amazed. There is no real lore about what is going on around you, but the characters and the deeper meaning behind the story are extremely well made. There is no dialogue, just the environment and a few cutscenes. That only makes the story more interesting and makes you want to find out about the world around you. The only gripe that I have with the story is that it is way too cryptic. It's ok to have your story just be the environment and few cutscenes and to make you think about the story, but there is a real lack of explanation for a lot of things, at least a point in the right direction would go a long way to helping everyone understand the story. \nSCORE 8/10\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1] \nRiME is one of the most beautiful exploration game that I have ever played, with great music and an interesting story. However, the story is a bit cryptic and it's a bit short. Apart from that though, I would say RiME is one of the coolest games I've played in 2017.\n[i]OVERALL SCORE 8.75 [u]GREAT[/u]\n+Amazing artstyle \n+Great music \n+Nice exploration \n+Great story \n~Game is a bit short\n~The game is mostly a walking simulator \n-Story is unnecessarily cryptic \n[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1510241506, "timestamp_updated": 1511844388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36374816": {"recommendationid": "36374816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006601253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1510145913}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorgeous visual style.

RiME, for some reason, has a \"boundary\" on edges of cliffs and such where the character wobbles around like he's about to fall off a cliff whenever he's on a ledge, which was helpful in some cases where i would rather not fall off, and not helpful in others where i was purposefully trying to jump down. and the fact that the player controls the camera on some ledges made the controls very weird depending on the camera angle \u2013 almost like the forward button meant left or vice versa, and somehow when the camera control was fixed it was also annoying, as i either couldn't see where i was supposed to go or i missed that lack of freedom with the camera. and that's not even mentioning the problems i had RiME's death animation. pretty much the only way to die is to get your soul sucked out by vicious passive-aggressive dementors or to jump off a cliff. the soul-sucking is fine, i guess. but when you jump off a cliff, within a millisecond the game realizes that you're gonna die and the screen goes black and you respawn. there's nothing interesting about the animation. for example, what if, when you fell off a cliff, you could watch the boy fall right until he was about to hit the ground and then the black screen? this gives the player more emotional connection with the character and a better reason to not try and jump off cliffs.\n\nbut that's not to say i didn't love RiME. again, without any spoilers, i loved the final moments of the game, and i really enjoyed the atmosphere, artwork, and even the story at times. i'm not so certain that it's worth its full price of $30, (maybe at $20 or $15 is a better price) but i enjoyed my time with RiME overall, and i'm certain that if you're into these types of games that you will, too.", "timestamp_created": 1509206740, "timestamp_updated": 1612072680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53844153881072998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36067383": {"recommendationid": "36067383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048495975", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1509171472}, "language": "english", "review": "abslutly breath takeing game play but it wont run on my computer for some reson ( i checked i meet Over all the requirments)", "timestamp_created": 1509172627, "timestamp_updated": 1509172627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481880843639373779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36012461": {"recommendationid": "36012461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032892475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 842, "last_played": 1508600202}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those games you absolutely don't play for its mechanics and general gameplay.
